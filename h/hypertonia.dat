5|$|<b>Hypertonia</b> – <b>Hypertonia</b> {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. <b>Hypertonia</b> may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, <b>hypertonia,</b> hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypertonia</b> - <b>Hypertonia</b> {{is marked}} by an {{abnormal}} increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. <b>Hypertonia</b> may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to {{the central nervous system}} (e.g. cerebral palsy).|$|E
25|$|Memantine is, in general, well-tolerated. Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common {{adverse effects}} include vomiting, anxiety, <b>hypertonia,</b> cystitis, and increased libido.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{doses of}} escitalopram usually cause {{relatively}} minor untoward effects such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, <b>hypertonia,</b> and clonus may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are {{usually in a}} range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than citalopram in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to <b>hypertonia</b> in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
25|$|Officially, Daniil died at 1 AM on November 17, 1962 (1960 in some sources), at Aiud prison hospital, having {{suffered}} a stroke that left him comatose—afflictions which, in themselves, {{seem to suggest that}} he had been severely beaten in confinement. Prison records have it that, since 1959, he had been under medical supervision for <b>hypertonia.</b> However, it is unlikely that he was ever administered the medicine specified in his chart, which appears to have been forged and backdated. The hieromonk's body {{is said to have been}} dumped at the nearby Trei Plopi burial site, an iron spike driven through his heart by prison guards who meant to certify Tudor's death.|$|E
25|$|Athetoid {{cerebral}} palsy or dyskinetic {{cerebral palsy}} (sometimes abbreviated ADCP) {{is a type}} of cerebral palsy primarily associated with damage, like other forms of CP, to the basal ganglia in the form of lesions that occur during brain development due to bilirubin encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Unlike spastic or ataxic cerebral palsies, ADCP is characterized by both <b>hypertonia</b> and hypotonia, due to the affected individual's inability to control muscle tone. Clinical diagnosis of ADCP typically occurs within 18 months of birth and is primarily based upon motor function and neuroimaging techniques. While there are no cures for ADCP, some drug therapies as well as speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy have shown capacity for treating the symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{clonazepam}} during pregnancy {{is less clear}} than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the fetus. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, floppy infant syndrome, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include <b>hypertonia,</b> hyperreflexia, restlessness, irritability, abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, tremors or jerking of the extremities, bradycardia, cyanosis, suckling difficulties, apnea, risk of aspiration of feeds, diarrhea and vomiting, and growth retardation. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or breast feeding, {{it is recommended that}} serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of central nervous system depression and apnea are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of caffeine, can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the wide}} variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have, there are several {{categories}} in which the athletes compete. [...] The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types. [...] The categories are impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency, [...] leg length difference, short stature, <b>hypertonia,</b> [...] ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. These categories are further broken down into classifications, which vary from sport to sport.|$|E
500|$|The Paralympic Games {{is a major}} {{international}} multi-sport event involving athletes {{with a range of}} disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), [...] leg length difference, short stature, <b>hypertonia,</b> [...] ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).|$|E

2500|$|Tay–Sachs {{disease is}} {{typically}} first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus, {{known as the}} [...] "startle response," [...] because they are startled. There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (<b>hypertonia).</b> The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|... {{respiratory}} distress syndrome for the baby, and infarction of the bowels. Early reports {{found that}} cocaine-exposed babies were {{at high risk}} for sudden infant death syndrome; however, by itself, cocaine exposure during fetal development has not subsequently been identified as a risk factor for the syndrome. Some, but not all, PCE children experience <b>hypertonia</b> (excessive muscle tone), and reduced reflexes and motor function have been found in babies four to six weeks old.|$|E
2500|$|Athetoid {{cerebral}} palsy or dyskinetic {{cerebral palsy}} (sometimes abbreviated ADCP) is primarily associated with {{damage to the}} basal ganglia {{in the form of}} lesions that occur during brain development due to bilirubin encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

2500|$|Data {{from animal}} {{experiments}} indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic, but is embryotoxic in high doses. [...] In humans, no controlled studies exist. [...] Reports in pregnant women revealed possible {{damage to the}} fetus, {{although most of the}} women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition, [...] reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, <b>hypertonia,</b> hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk.|$|E
2500|$|Basic hyperkinetic {{movements}} can {{be defined}} as any unwanted, excess movement. Such abnormal movements can be distinguished from each other on the basis of whether or not, or to what degree they are, rhythmic, discrete, repeated, and random. In evaluating the individual with a suspected form of hyperkinesia, the physician will record a thorough medical history including a clear description of the movements in question, medications prescribed in the past and present, family history of similar diseases, medical history including past infections, and any past exposure to toxic chemicals. Hyperkinesia is a defining feature of many childhood movement disorders, yet distinctly differs from both <b>hypertonia</b> and negative signs, which are also typically involved in such disorders. Several prominent forms of hyperkinetic movements include: ...|$|E

50|$|After stroke or {{spinal cord}} injury in humans, spastic <b>hypertonia</b> (spastic paralysis) often develops, whereby the stretch reflex in flexor muscles of the arms and {{extensor}} muscles of the legs is overly sensitive. This results in abnormal postures, stiffness and contractures. <b>Hypertonia</b> {{may be the result}} of over-sensitivity of alpha motoneurons and interneurons to the Ia and II afferent signals.|$|E
50|$|An {{abnormal}} Landau reflex {{may indicate}} hypotonia or <b>hypertonia</b> and may indicate a motor development issue.|$|E
50|$|Basic {{principles}} {{of treatment for}} <b>hypertonia</b> are to avoid noxious stimuli and provide frequent range of motion exercise.|$|E
50|$|Hypotonia and/or <b>hypertonia</b> {{are present}} in nearly all {{individuals}} with tetrasomy 18p. Approximately 25% have a seizure disorder.|$|E

5000|$|... altered {{muscle tone}} (hypotonia or <b>hypertonia)</b> - a {{decrease}} or {{increase in the}} baseline level of muscle activity ...|$|E
50|$|The upper {{motor neuron}} lesion {{in the brain}} impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to {{properly}} receive gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). That leads to <b>hypertonia</b> in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves. The limbs and body areas in which <b>hypertonia</b> manifests can be any or even all of them, depending which specific nerve groupings within the spine are rendered unable to receive GABA. Thus, spastic CP is often designated by body topography.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{disorders}} {{can result}} in abnormally low (hypotonia) or high (<b>hypertonia)</b> muscle tone. Another form of <b>hypertonia</b> is paratonia, which is associated with dementia. Hypotonia is seen in lower motor neuron disease like poliomyelitis. Hypotonia can present clinically as muscle flaccidity, where the limbs appear floppy, stretch reflex responses are decreased, and the limb's resistance to passive movement is also decreased. <b>Hypertonia</b> is seen in upper motor neuron diseases like lesions in pyramidal tract and extrapyramidal tract. <b>Hypertonia</b> can present clinically as either spasticity or rigidity. While spasticity is velocity-dependent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. passively moving an elbow quickly will elicit increased muscle tone, but passively moving elbow slowly may not elicit increased muscle tone), rigidity is velocity-independent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. there is uniform increased tone whether the elbow is passively moved quickly or slowly).Spasticity {{can be in the}} form of the clasp-knife response, in which there is increased resistance only at the beginning or at the end of the movement. Rigidity can be of the leadpipe type, in which there is resistance throughout to passive movement, or it may be of cogwheel type, in which the resistance to passive movement is in a jerky manner.|$|E
50|$|Spastic <b>hypertonia</b> {{involves}} uncontrollable muscle spasms, stiffening or {{straightening out}} of muscles, shock-like contractions of {{all or part}} of a group of muscles, and abnormal muscle tone. It is seen in disorders such as cerebral palsy, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Rigidity is a severe state of <b>hypertonia</b> where muscle resistance occurs throughout the entire range of motion of the affected joint independent of velocity. It is frequently associated with lesions of the basal ganglia. Individuals with rigidity present with stiffness, decreased range of motion and loss of motor control. Dystonic <b>hypertonia</b> refers to muscle resistance to passive stretching (in which a therapist gently stretches the inactive contracted muscle to a comfortable length at very low speeds of movement) and a tendency of a limb to return to a fixed involuntary (and sometimes abnormal) posture following movement.|$|E
50|$|Various {{clinical}} features {{have been associated}} with this disease including trigonocephaly, flattened occiput, prominent forehead, broad flat nasal bridge, anteverted nares, malformed external ears, hypertelorism, and <b>hypertonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{patients}} {{pass into}} adolescence, the syndrome {{is characterized by}} a coarse and flat face, macroglossia, prognathism, inverted lower lip, and psychomotor retardation with muscular <b>hypertonia</b> and contractures.|$|E
50|$|Hyperekplexia ("exaggerated surprise") is a {{neurologic}} disorder classically characterised by pronounced startle {{responses to}} tactile or acoustic stimuli and <b>hypertonia.</b> The <b>hypertonia</b> may be predominantly truncal, attenuated during sleep and less prominent {{after a year}} of age. Classic hyperekplexia is caused by genetic mutations {{in a number of different}} genes, all of which play an important role in glycine neurotransmission. Glycine is used by the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Hyperekplexia is generally classified as a genetic disease, but some disorders can mimic the exaggerated startle of hyperekplexia.|$|E
50|$|The only sign of BFNE are seizures, {{generally}} tonic-clonic, which {{occur within}} {{the first week of}} life. Seizures often begin as apnea, cyanosis, and <b>hypertonia</b> and last less than 1 minute.|$|E
50|$|Hyperekplexia is an {{extremely}} rare autosomal dominant neurological disease. The symptoms start in infancy with <b>hypertonia,</b> an abnormal muscle tension that decreases flexibility, and an exaggerated startle in all ages of life.|$|E
