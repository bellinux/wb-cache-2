40|$|The Neogene Meyer <b>Desert</b> <b>Formation,</b> Sirius Group, at Oliver Bluffs in the Transantarctic Mountains, {{contains}} {{a sequence of}} glacial deposits formed under a wet-based glacial regime. Within this sequence fluvial deposits have yielded fossil plants that, along with evidence from fossil insects, invertebrates and palaeosols, indicate the existence of tundra conditions at 85 °S during the Neogene. Mean annual temperatures of c. – 12 °C are estimated, with short summer seasons with temperatures up to + 5 °C. The current published date for this formation is Pliocene, although this is hotly debated. Reconstructions produced by the TRIFFID and BIOME 4 vegetation models, utilizing a Pliocene climatology derived from the HadAM 3 General Circulation Model (running with prescribed boundary conditions from the US Geological Survey PRISM 2 dataset), also predict tundra-type vegetation in Antarctica.

40|$|AbstractFossil pollen and dinocyst {{records in}} marine {{sequences}} are frequently combined {{to reveal the}} response of vegetation and ocean conditions to changes in both regional and global climate. In this study we analysed pollen and dinocysts within a clearly-laminated sediment core off the Iranian coast in the Gulf of Oman, an extremely data-poor area, to reconstruct climatic change during the Late Holocene (last 1900 years). The vegetation record from southern Iran indicates a replacement of savannah by <b>desert</b> <b>formations</b> at c. 910 CE, shortly after the Islamic invasion and the subsequent collapse of the Sassanid Empire. From c. 910 to 1145 CE, during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), the vegetation was heavily dominated by <b>desert</b> <b>formations,</b> such as Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Centaurea and Calligonum. In parallel, in the Gulf of Oman, the presence of Impagidinium paradoxum indicates a lack of freshwater discharge into the ocean around this time. The desert taxa of the MCA were subsequently replaced by savannah formations at c. 1145 CE, comprised mainly of Poaceae and Cyperaceae, corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA), indicating generally wetter climatic conditions. A sudden increase in Spiniferites ramosus (1 – 63 %), at c. 1440 CE suggests {{an increase in the}} strength of the SW summer monsoon, with increased freshwater discharge into the ocean at this time. Our data indicate that over the past two millennia the NW Arabian Sea region has alternated between contrasting climatic conditions, with firstly a humid phase equivalent to the cultural period of the Sassanid Empire, a significantly drier climate during the MCA and a relatively wetter climate during the LIA. The mechanisms resulting in dry conditions during the MCA in the Middle East associated with the northward shift of the ITCZ and the intensification of the Indian summer monsoon may be similar to those causing the dry conditions which dominated the Early Holocene in the Near East. Our palaeoenvironmental proxy data support current observations that a globally anthropogenically-induced warmer climate is likely to lead to increased drought severity in the Middle East, putting additional stress on governments already struggling with poverty and social tensions...|$|R

40|$|Global {{vegetation}} models traditionally treat anthropogenic land-use and land-cover changes (LULCCs) only as {{the changes}} in vegetation cover seen {{from one year to}} the next (net transitions). This approach ignores subgrid-scale processes such as shifting cultivation which do not affect the net vegetation distribution but which {{have an impact on the}} carbon budget. The differences in the carbon stocks feed back on processes like wildfires and <b>desert</b> <b>formation.</b> The simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) all describe LULCCs using the "Land-Use Harmonization Dataset". Though this dataset describes such subgrid-scale processes (gross transitions), some of the CMIP 5 models still use the traditional approach. Using JSBACH/CBALANCE – the land carbon component of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), this study demonstrates how this potentially leads to a severe underestimation of the carbon emissions from LULCCs Using net transitions lowers the average land-use emissions from 1. 44 to 0. 90 Pg C yr − 1 (38 %) during the historical period (1850 – 2005) – a total lowering by 85 Pg C. The difference between the methods is smaller in the RCP scenarios (2006 – 2100) but in RCP 2. 6 and RCP 8. 5 still cumulates to 30 – 40 Pg C (on average 0. 3 – 0. 4 Pg C yr − 1 or 13 – 25 %). In RCP 4. 5 essentially no difference between the methods is found. Results from models using net transitions are furthermore found to be sensitive to model resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{deals with the}} taxonomic {{circumscription}} of the genus Nothoceros and transferring the widely recognized species of American Megaceros to Nothoceros. In this chapter I used the genes rbcL and nad 5 and sampling from most hornwort genera. The second and third chapters focus on the genus Nothoceros using Bayesian dating analyses and maximum likelihood approaches using 5 chloroplast markers (rbcL, matK, trnL-F intron, trnL-F spacer, rps 4 -trnS spacer), the mitochondrial nad 4 -nad 5 spacer and the nuclear ITS 2. I explored the evolution of sexual condition; biogeography and phylogenetic affinites of Nothoceros aenigmaticus. This species survives as gametophytes only and displays a unique pattern of sex allopatry in the Southern Appalachians: male plants are ca. 30 miles apart from the closest female populations. This unisexual clonal species originated from sexually reproducing dioicous high elevation tropical populations. We provide the first phylogenetic evidence of a reversal from monoeicy to dioecy (to asexuality in N. aenigmaticus), {{in marked contrast to}} the assumed plesiomorphic condition of dioecy in bryophytes. The most conservative mean estimates for asexuality in N. aenigmaticus are from the Pleistocene (less than 1. 5 mya), older than most calculated estimates for clonal—only plants published to date. In the third chapter, I explored the biogeography of Nothoceros. We sampled multiple accessions per species to test the potential concordance between three main geological events: West-Gondwana break up in the Late Cretaceous, Atacama <b>Desert</b> <b>formation</b> in the Miocene and Páramo formation in the Pliocene with cladogenic events within the Nothoceros. Our dated phylogeny suggests that those geological events were not likely shaping the current distribution patterns of the genus Nothoceros. In contrast, short-range dispersal may account for the distribution of the genus. The last part of the dissertation deals with the population genetics of N. aenigmaticus. Here we present a unique case of sex allopatry in a non-flowering plant that seems to reproduce clonally and to be genetically isolated from their closest relative in Mexico. The genetic structure of the Southern Appalachian plant appears to be partly influenced by the geological consequences of the Last Glaciation and the impact of stream capture is discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly complex {{life forms}} {{were found in}} older {{biological}} soil crusts in the Gurbantaunggut Desert in Northwestern China. These crusts may {{play a critical role}} in mineral erosion and <b>desert</b> soil <b>formation</b> by modifying the weathering environment and ultimately affecting mineralogical variance. To test this hypothesis, variations in the morphological features and mineralogical components of successional biological soil crusts at 1 cm were studied by optical microscopy, SEM and grain size analysis. Concentrations of erosion-resistant minerals decreased with crust succession, while minerals susceptible to weathering increased with crust development. Neogenetic minerals were found in late stage crusts, but not in early stage crusts. Silt and clay concentrations were highest in early formation crusts and soil mean particle size decreased with crust succession. Cyanobacteria, lichen and moss were shown to erode and etch rocks, and secondary minerals produced by weathering were localized with the living organisms. Thus, more developed crusts appeared to contribute to greater mineral weathering and may be a major cause of mineralogical variance seen in the Gurbantunggut Desert. The greater activity and complexity of older crusts, as well as their improved moisture condition may function to accelerate mineral weathering. Therefore, protection and recovery of biological crusts is vital for <b>desert</b> soil <b>formation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} black desert varnish {{is that it}} has an unusually high concentration of manganese.

A micro-environment pH above 7.5 is inhospitable for manganese-concentrating microbes. In such conditions, orange varnishes develop, poor in manganese (Mn) but rich in iron (Fe).
