40|$|This report {{explores the}} problem of {{substring}} search in a dynamic document set. The operations supported are <b>document</b> <b>inclusion,</b> document removal and queries. This is a well explored field for word indexes, but not for substring indexes. The contributions of this report is the exploration of a multi-document dynamic suffix tree (MDST), which is compared with using a hierarchy of static indexes using suffix arrays. Only memory resident data structures are explored. The concept of a ``generalised suffix tree'', indexing a static set of strings, is used in bioinformatics. The implemented data structure adds online <b>document</b> <b>inclusion,</b> update and removal, linear on the single document size. Various models for the hierarchy of static indexes is explored, some which of give faster update, and some faster search. For the static suffix arrays, the BPR cite{SS 05 } construction algorithm is used, which is the fastest known. This algorithm is about 3 - 4 {{times faster than the}} implemented suffix tree construction. Two tricks for speeding up search and hit reporting in the suffix array are also explored: Using a start index for the binary search, and a direct map of global addresses to document IDs and local addresses. The tests show that the MDST is much faster than the hierarchic indexes when the index freshness requirement is absolute, and the documents are small. The tree uses about three times as much memory as the suffix arrays. When there is a large number of hits, the suffix arrays are slightly faster on reporting hits, as there they have better memory locality. If you have enough primary memory, the MDST seems to be the best choice in general. </p...|$|E

40|$|Investigations on how {{exercise}} {{and physical activity}} affect dual-task (DT) performance in the elderly are growing rapidly {{due to the fact}} that DT activities are commonplace with activities of daily living. Preliminary evidence has shown the benefit in exercise on DT balance, though it is unclear to what extent the effect exercise has on DT performance in elderly subjects with disease conditions, including subjects with a high risk of falls. Hence, the objective of this study was to critically review the existing evidence of a potential relationship between {{exercise and}} improvement of static and dynamic balance during DT conditions as well as secondary outcomes in elderly subjects with different disease conditions. A systematic search using online databases was performed to source <b>documents.</b> <b>Inclusion</b> criteria sourced articles classified as randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled trials (CT) and uncontrolled trials (UT). Moreover, the studies had to administrate an exercise or physical activity protocol in the intervention. Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria and were comprised of 12 RCTs, 3 CTs, and 2 UTs. Overall, 13 studies supported exercise being effective to improve parameters of static and dynamic balance during single or DT conditions. Despite the heterogeneity of pathologic conditions, exercise showed similar benefits to improve function in two main areas: neurological conditions and frailty conditions. The lack of a common method to assess DT performance limited the ability to compare different interventions directly. Future research is warranted to study the optimal dose and exercise modalities to best reduce the risk of falls in the elderly with multiple disease conditions...|$|R

Using inclusive masculinity theory, he demonstrates {{that there has been}} an erosion of homophobia and a softening of masculinity among 16- to 18-year-old boys. In addition to <b>documenting</b> the <b>inclusion</b> of LGBT students, he finds boys engage in a great deal of homosocial tactility, and that they esteem acts of social inclusion. He also develops a class analysis to show that while class does act as a dampener on progressive attitudes, it does not prevent them. Thus, he supports inclusive masculinity theory’s central argument that these changes are the result of a substantial decrease in homohysteria in the broader youth culture.|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of four Norwegian policy <b>documents</b> on <b>inclusion</b> of minority language pupils. The main concepts of this policy will be reconstructed and re-described, applying Niklas Luhmann's systems theory {{at different levels of}} the analysis. Luhmann's theory about society as a conglomerate of self-referential social systems investigates how these systems construct meaning and what consequences these constructions have for inclusion and exclusion processes. This article will focus on the Norwegian educational policy towards minority language pupils, defined by the policy as pupils who have a different mother tongue than Norwegian and Sami language. It is argued that this inclusion policy is excluding in its social form, and that it exhibits an increased emphasis on education when it comes to inclusion in society. Re-descriptions based on logic of forms will show how binary distinctions such as ‘inclusion/exclusion', ‘majority language pupil/minority language pupil' and ‘early intervention/wait and see' emerge in the timespan of 2004 – 2012. Based on this, it is claimed that descriptions of inclusion and exclusion are mutually constituted in the policy, thus giving rise {{to the question of whether}} the policy goal – ‘full' inclusion in society – is realisable. A paradox will be uncovered: minority language pupils are being included as excluded as well as excluded as included in the <b>documents,</b> displaying how <b>inclusion</b> and exclusion are two sides of the same coin. The strategy early intervention is introduced to remedy exclusions, thus converting the problem of inclusion into a problem of time...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{umbrella}} review {{aimed at}} eliciting good practice characteristics of interventions and policies aiming at healthy diet, increasing physical activity, and lowering sedentary behaviors. Applying the World Health Organization's framework, we sought for 3 types of characteristics, reflecting: (1) main intervention/policy characteristics, {{referring to the}} design, targets, and participants, (2) monitoring and evaluation processes, and (3) implementation issues. This investigation was undertaken by the DEDPIAC Knowledge Hub (the Knowledge Hub on the DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity), which is an action of the European Union's joint programming initiative. METHODS: A systematic review of reviews and stakeholder documents was conducted. Data from 7 databases was analyzed (99 <b>documents</b> met <b>inclusion</b> criteria). Additionally, resources of 7 major stakeholders (e. g., World Health Organization) were systematically searched (10 <b>documents</b> met <b>inclusion</b> criteria). Overall, the review yielded 74 systematic reviews, 16 position review papers, and 19 stakeholders' documents. Across characteristics, 25 % were supported by[*]≥[*] 4 systematic reviews. Further, 25 % characteristics were supported by[*]≥[*] 3 stakeholders' documents. If identified characteristics were included in at least 4 systematic reviews or at least 3 stakeholders' documents, these good practice characteristics were classified as relevant. RESULTS: We derived a list of 149 potential good practice characteristics, of which 53 were classified as relevant. The main characteristics of intervention/policy (n[*]=[*] 18) fell into 6 categories: the use of theory, participants, target behavior, content development/management, multidimensionality, practitioners/settings. Monitoring and evaluation characteristics (n[*]=[*] 18) were grouped into 6 categories: costs/funding, outcomes, evaluation of effects, time/effect size, reach, the evaluation of participation and generalizability, active components/underlying processes. Implementation characteristics (n[*]=[*] 17) were grouped into eight categories: participation processes, training for practitioners, the use/integration of existing resources, feasibility, maintenance/sustainability, implementation partnerships, implementation consistency/adaptation processes, transferability. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the proposed list of 53 good practice characteristics may foster further development of health promotion sciences, as it would allow for identification of success vectors in the domains of main characteristics of interventions/policies, their implementation, evaluation and monitoring processes...|$|R

The success of all students, including students with disabilities, on statewide assessments in mathematics and reading/English language arts has been examined closely, partly due to the role of these content areas in school accountability for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) known as "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB).
