5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The eight strongest {{religious}} affiliations in {{the area}} (based on the 2006 census figures) were (in descending order): Anglican, Catholic, Uniting, Lutheran, Orthodox Christian, Buddhist, Presbyterian, Church of Christ and Baptist (a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and the Church of Christ, with 31 adherents). Also of note <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> occurrence of religious affiliation (67.3%) in the region {{in comparison to the}} Adelaide (and national) average. Christian belief (64.4%) is most prominent, with little growth in other religions.|$|E
5|$|The main factor {{behind this}} shift <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> summer {{temperature}} difference between Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. This {{is accompanied by}} a seasonal excursion of the normally equatorial intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a low-pressure belt of highly unstable weather, northward towards India. This system intensified to its present strength {{as a result of the}} Tibetan Plateau's uplift, which accompanied the Eocene–Oligocene transition event, a major episode of global cooling and aridification which occurred 34–49Ma.|$|E

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the widening <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The widening of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. Widening of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while widening of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E
