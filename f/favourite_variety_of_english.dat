40|$|English {{becomes an}} {{international}} language {{because many people}} around the world communicate using English. The abundant number of people who use English leads to the possible <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> This paper aims to know how the graduate students’ response toward the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> Twenty one students of graduate program of State University of Malang were involved in the study. The questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The questionnaires consisted of three variables. They are respondents’ knowledge about <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and their proficiency, how the respondents teach <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> and the function <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> The resuts <b>of</b> the study showed that the respondents have low proficience and knowledge about <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> the respondents use listening materials and the respondents know the function <b>of</b> knowing <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> To sum up, introducing <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> can be taught by using listening materials...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates 43 Korean adults’ {{attitudes towards}} native and {{non-native}} <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> {{in relation to}} the perspective <b>of</b> EIL (<b>English</b> as an international language). This study addresses three research questions: 1) do Korean adults prefer certain <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English?</b> 2) do Korean adults at least accept non-native <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English?,</b> and 3) are Korean adults aware <b>of</b> different <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English?</b> In order to examine participants’ language attitudes, this study employed both a verbal guise test as an indirect approach and a qualitative questionnaire as a direct approach. For the verbal guise test, six <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> were selected to measure participants’ perceptions of native and non-native <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> based on Kachru’s (1985) circles <b>of</b> <b>English</b> use: American and British English in the inner circle, Hong Kong and Indian English in the outer circle, and Korean and Taiwanese-accented English in the expanding circle. The main findings present important insights into Korean adults’ perspectives on EIL: 1) they preferred American English as a model for guidance and did not discriminate native and non-native <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> 2) they regarded English as an international language to communicate not only with native speakers but also with non-native speakers <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> and showed positive attitudes to non-native <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> and 3) they were not well aware <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> This finding implies that English language teaching in Korea should emphasize learners’ awareness <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in order that they can command EIL without difficulty. This study suggests that further comprehensive investigations into changes in Koreans’ language attitudes and their needs as L 2 learners be made because they should be reflected in English language teaching which has emphasized EFL rather than EIL...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT As the {{lingua franca}} <b>of</b> South Africa, <b>English</b> is spoken by first {{language}} (L 1) and additional language (AL) speakers, resulting in <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> being spoken. Internationally, research {{findings suggest that}} listeners form attitudes toward people according to their language (Cargile et al 1994 and Labov 1969 a, b, 1972). In a country with much diversity in language, South Africans’ attitudes and their subsequent behaviour toward speakers {{are likely to be}} affected by a speaker’s language or variety thereof. This research aimed to establish the attitudes that student teachers <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> Mathematics and Science hold toward <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> spoken <b>English,</b> with a specific focus on learners’ spoken <b>English.</b> Two AL <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> (Afrikaans South African English and Black South African English) and two L 1 varieties (Indian South African English and White South African English) were investigated. 18 third and fourth year student teachers from the University of the Witwatersrand participated in focus groups interviews. Each focus group followed a two-part format. Firstly, participants responded, by means of a questionnaire, to four voice recordings, each representing one <b>of</b> the <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> being researched. Secondly, the student teachers discussed their attitudes toward <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> These attitudes were then analysed within a qualitative framework. This analysis was informed by Labov (1969 a, b, 1972) who demonstrated that one’s <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> is not an indicator of one’s intellect and ability. Kachru’s Three Concentric Circles (1996) provided a model for the interpretation of the data. This model distinguishes between L 1 and AL <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> and illustrates the equality that exists between <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> - both <b>of</b> which are key factors within a study <b>of</b> attitudes toward <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in South Africa. The findings indicated that, despite the equality that both Labov (1969 a, b, 1972) and Kachru (1996) outline, student teachers’ attitudes toward a speaker’s <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> are affected by numerous factors. These factors include the student teachers’ racial background, language, education and teaching subjects. Participants voiced a range <b>of</b> attitudes toward <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> spoken <b>English</b> with some believing that one <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> White South Africa English, holds more linguistic capital while other participants perceive English to be a means of communication and therefore do not stress a specific <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>English.</b> A potential consequence of these attitudes is that the participants’ interaction with and treatment of speakers <b>of</b> other <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> might be influenced, either negatively or positively. Within the classroom this could affect the teaching and learning process if teachers’ treatment and assessment of their learners are modified according to a learner’s <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> spoken <b>English...</b>|$|R

40|$|Language {{attitude}} {{studies have}} tended to assume that informants who listen to and evaluate speech stimuli are able to identify with consistent accuracy the <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> in question. However, misidentification could reduce the validity of any results obtained, particularly when it involves the evaluations of non-native English-speaking informants, {{who are likely to}} have had less exposure to <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> speech. The present study investigated the perceptions of 558 Japanese university students <b>of</b> six <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> speech. The results indicated that whilst evaluations of speakers of UK and US English were particularly positive in terms of status, a Japanese speaker <b>of</b> heavily–accented <b>English</b> was rated most favourably in terms of social attractiveness. The findings from an additional dialect recognition question demonstrated that accurate identification had a significant positive effect upon the perceived status <b>of</b> native <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> suggesting a tendency amongst the informants to look to native speakers to provide ‘notions of correctness’. The results also imply that Japanese learners retain representations <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> speech and draw upon this resource, whether consciously or unconsciously, in order to identify and evaluate (speakers <b>of)</b> these speech <b>varieties...</b>|$|R
