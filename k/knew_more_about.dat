5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} relocated {{her job to}} the Pentagon, {{because they}} {{felt that she was}} spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E

He was also a fine, dependable third baseman and, from the start, he {{had the ability to}} hit the ball to all fields, regardless of size or capacity. Owner of a strong throwing arm, he had good range, being able to catch fly balls from his left field and infield teammates, making everything look easy.|$|E

25|$|In 1673 he was {{involved}} {{with the establishment of}} the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, which was to train 40 boys annually in navigation, {{for the benefit of the}} Royal Navy and the English Merchant Navy. In 1675 he was appointed a Governor of Christ's Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memoranda on the administration of the school. In 1699, after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a man who <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the sea, he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a Freeman of the City of London.|$|E
25|$|The empire crumbled again {{amid the}} burnout of {{another of his}} creations, the 1979–80 Three's a Crowd (in which three sets of wives and {{secretaries}} competed to see who <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> their husbands/bosses). This show provoked protests from enraged feminist and socially conservative groups (two otherwise diametrically opposed viewpoints), who charged that the show deliberately exploited adultery, to advocate it as a social norm. Most stations dropped this show months before the season was over {{as a response to}} those criticisms. At the same time, Newlywed lost the sponsorships of Ford and Procter & Gamble and earned the resentment of Jackie Autry, whose husband and business partner Gene Autry owned the show's Los Angeles outlet and production base, KTLA, because of its supposedly highly prurient content. So strong were the feelings of the Autrys that Newlywed came close to being expelled from the KTLA facilities, but the show was discontinued by the syndicator before any action occurred. Gong Show and Dating Game also ended otherwise successful syndicated runs in 1980 because of the Three's a Crowd and Newlywed controversies, likely because stations were fearful of community and advertiser retribution on account of Barris' reputation.|$|E
25|$|In September 1911, Vanagaitis started {{publishing}} journal Birutė which began {{using the term}} Lithuania Minor more often, competing with previous preferred term Prussian Lithuania. This reflected {{a shift in the}} understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green–white–red flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the great leader), it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutė provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutė was plagued by lack of leadership and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages.|$|E

500|$|Becoming {{immediately}} {{known for}} his quiet nature, Alston was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "The Quiet Man". Alston's personality contrasted with that of Dressen, who was much more outspoken. Sportswriters had difficulty writing about Alston at first because he did not say much. He also seemed more conservative in his decisions on the field, which drew criticism from his players even though he had managed many of them in the minor leagues. Don Zimmer said that he had learned more from Dressen and that Dressen <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> baseball than Alston. Jackie Robinson did not like Alston at first either, according to Robinson's wife.|$|E

Garrett <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Cher's voice and her persona as a singer than Sonny did", writes Bego. Billboard called [...] it [...] "one of the 20th century's greatest songs". It was featured on the 1971 album Chér (eventually reissued under the title Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves), which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its second single, [...] "The Way of Love", reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and established Cher's more confident image as a recording artist.|$|E

500|$|Collins, pg. 11 In addition, Collins {{notes that}} early pseudo-country musicians like Vernon Dalhart {{who had made}} their name {{recording}} 'country music songs' were not from the hills and hollows or plains and valleys. These recording stars sang both rural music and city music, and most <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Broadway than they did about hillbillies. Their rural image was often manufactured for the moment and the dollar. In contrast, Collins later explains, both the Carter Family and Rodgers had rural folk credibility that helped make Peer's recording session such an influential success; it was the Carter Family that was Ralk Peer's tie to the hills and hollows, to lost loves and found faith, but it took Jimmie Rodgers to connect the publisher with some of country music's other beloved symbols—trains and saloons, jail and the blues.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{was fascinated}} by the Zeus debate, {{especially}} the way that scientists were lined up on diametrically opposed positions for or against the system. He commented to Wiesner, [...] "I don’t understand. Scientists are supposed to be rational people. How can there be such differences on a technical issue?" [...] His fascination grew and he eventually compiled a mass of material on Zeus which took up one corner of a room where he spent hundreds of hours becoming an expert on the topic. In one meeting with Edward Teller, Kennedy demonstrated that he <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Zeus and ABMs than Teller. Teller then expended considerable effort to bring himself up to the same level of knowledge. Wiesner would later note that the pressure to make a decision built up until [...] "Kennedy came to feel that the only thing anybody in the country was concerned about was Nike-Zeus." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Anning <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> fossils and geology {{than many}} of the wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, it was always the gentlemen geologists who {{published}} the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this. Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: [...] "She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages." [...] Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.|$|E

500|$|Determined to {{make her}} novels as {{accurate}} as possible, Heyer collected reference works and research materials to use while writing. At {{the time of her}} death she owned over 1,000 historical reference books, including Debrett's and an 1808 dictionary of the House of Lords. In addition to the standard historical works about the medieval and eighteenth-century periods, her library included histories of snuff boxes, sign posts, and costumes. She often clipped illustrations from magazine articles and jotted down interesting vocabulary or facts onto note cards, but rarely recorded where she found the information. Her notes were sorted into categories, such as Beauty, Colours, Dress, Hats, Household, Prices, and Shops; and even included details such as the cost of candles in a particular year. Other notebooks contained lists of phrases, covering such topics as [...] "Food and Crockery", [...] "Endearments", and [...] "Forms of Address." [...] One of her publishers, Max Reinhardt, once attempted to offer editorial suggestions about the language in one of her books but was promptly informed by a member of his staff that no one in England <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Regency language than Heyer.|$|E
500|$|Enid Blyton {{was born}} on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich, South London, the eldest of three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a cutlery salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( [...] Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in Beckenham, then a village in Kent. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from {{whooping}} cough, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he [...] "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> them than anyone I had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated {{when he left the}} family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.|$|E
500|$|The Indiana Natural Gas and Oil Company, {{headquartered}} in Chicago, hired Haynes as their field superintendent in 1890 after the company's {{board of directors}} [...] "discovered that Elwood Haynes <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> natural gas {{than anyone in the}} state". He and his wife moved to Greentown where he oversaw the construction of the company's first pumping wells. The company planned to construct a natural gas line from eastern Indiana to Chicago, a distance of over , which would be the first long-distance natural gas pipeline built in the United States. Haynes supervised the design and construction phases of the project. Because of the length of the line and the temperature changes between the two points, moisture in the natural gas condensed on the pipe, and during colder times would freeze the pipes in some locations. The problem was a significant setback to the operation, which had to stop pumping during the winter months. Haynes solved the problem by creating a refrigeration device that would cause the moisture (which was a diluted form of gasoline) to condense, freeze, and fall into a reservoir. These devices were installed between the main lines and pumping stations and effectively removed all the moisture from the natural gas before it was pumped into the lines. This prevented water buildup in the pipes and allowed the pipes to be used year round. The concept was a significant advance in early refrigeration technology and was further developed by others in later years.|$|E
