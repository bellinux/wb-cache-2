500|$|At {{the census}} date there were 3,421 households, of which 2,317 (68%) were {{owned by the}} occupier, 756 (22%) were rented from Crawley Borough Council or another public-sector landlord, 274 (8%) were rented privately and 74 (2%) were {{occupied}} rent-free. [...] These proportions are almost identical to the housing tenure mix of Crawley as a whole. [...] The relatively high population density is partly explained by the relatively high proportion of residents who live in purpose-built flats or maisonettes of various types: 16% compared to the Crawley figure of 11%. [...] Many low-rise blocks of flats were built in Southgate West in the 1970s—in particular the extensive Caburn Heights development of three-storey blocks. [...] The most prevalent <b>housing</b> <b>type</b> in Southgate, in which 52% of residents live, is the terraced house. [...] The proportion is about ⅔ in Southgate West.|$|E
2500|$|The {{generic term}} [...] "slum" [...] is seldom used in Cuba, {{substandard}} housing is described: <b>housing</b> <b>type,</b> housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in solares (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families) and shanty towns {{to be the}} [...] "precarious housing stock" [...] and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of Old Havana and Centro Habana, as well as such neighbourhoods as Atarés in Regla. People living in slums {{have access to the}} same education, health care, job opportunities and social security as those who live in formerly privileged neighbourhoods. Shanty towns are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.|$|E
40|$|The private house {{building}} industry is increasingly {{under pressure to}} increase output and broaden the appeal of new-build housing to consumers. One possible method for meeting these objectives is through increased use of standardized components to facilitate <b>house</b> <b>type</b> customization. This research focuses {{on the role of}} planning and building regulations in permitting the {{house building}} industry to respond in this way. Using a database of standardized <b>house</b> <b>types,</b> the analysis examines variation within and between <b>house</b> builders' <b>house</b> <b>type</b> ranges. The analysis shows that the underlying variation between <b>house</b> <b>types</b> of a given size is relatively narrow but that volume builders maintain a comparatively large range of <b>house</b> <b>types.</b> Results from a simulation model demonstrate the positive impact of broadening <b>house</b> <b>type</b> choice on levels of consumer satisfaction. The main conclusion is that a form of <b>house</b> <b>type</b> customization could be achieved through the use of <b>house</b> <b>type</b> substitution. <b>House</b> building, standardized <b>house</b> <b>types,</b> customization, consumer choice, planning and building regulations,...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} natural {{ventilation}} provisions of residential {{buildings in the}} hot-humid climate of Putrajaya {{as well as the}} occupants’ utilization and overall satisfaction of these provisions. Five terrace <b>house</b> design <b>types</b> were selected for the study and natural ventilation (NV) provisions were identified through acquired building documents. Computer simulations were carried out on all <b>house</b> <b>types</b> to determine the ventilation rates delivered by the NV provisions. Furthermore, a total of 298 households from the selected <b>house</b> <b>types</b> were surveyed. Two <b>house</b> <b>types</b> were found not to comply with the Uniform Building By-Law (UBBL) governing NV provisions in Malaysia and those <b>house</b> <b>types</b> that complied were found to exhibit higher ventilation rates. Occupants’ level of satisfaction when utilising NV was found to be significantly related to opening sizes complying with UBBL, longer duration of opening windows, and occupants’ means of achieving comfort. This paper informs designers on the importance of complying with the required law governing NV in residential buildings. It also highlights the need for a strict effective enforcement of UBBL compliance for the purpose of building approvals...|$|R
