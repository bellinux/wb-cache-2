5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being {{a threat to the}} Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there is no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mint where each coin was struck.

5|$|Metalwork was an {{important}} and well-developed craft, and metal tools such as axes, mammoties and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military. A good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development of metalwork of this period is the Lovamahapaya, which had been roofed entirely with copper.|$|E
5|$|A ship sunk in {{the western}} Gulf of Mexico on October1, {{which was the first}} <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second {{tropical}} cyclone of the season. The storm moved slowly northeastward toward the southeastern Louisiana coastline, intensifying to its estimated peak winds of 70mph (115km/h). On October4, it passed near or over southeastern Louisiana, producing heavy rain and gusty winds in New Orleans. Flooding was observed in portions of the city, and the West Rigolets Lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain suffered $5,000 in damage due to the storm (1868USD, $81,000 2010USD). The storm accelerated northeastward and struck near Apalachicola, Florida late on October4.|$|E

5|$|An <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is {{that they}} appear to have been {{preferentially}} recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiquity of {{the tradition of the}} story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, and other large stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed to destroy a single completed U-boat on the slip until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be checked by attacking production. An <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E
5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to killer whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E
5|$|Enron's stock {{increased}} {{from the start}} of the 1990s until year-end 1998 by 311%, only modestly higher than the average rate of growth in the Standard & Poor 500 index. However, the stock increased by 56% in 1999 and a further 87% in 2000, compared to a 20% increase and a 10% decrease for the index during the same years. By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was priced at $83.13 and its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion, 70 times earnings and six times book value, an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock market's high expectations about its future prospects. In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in Fortunes Most Admired Companies survey.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E

5|$|Gustav Vasa, 16th-century King of Sweden. Nearly {{a decade}} before his death, he had {{expressed}} a wish {{to be buried in}} the cathedral. He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shift that Winter Legends, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.|$|E
