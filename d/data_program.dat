According to research by the Veterinary Medical <b>Data</b> <b>Program</b> (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.|$|E

40|$|Large labeled {{training}} {{sets are}} the critical {{building blocks of}} supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can "denoise" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models {{in a handful of}} settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F 1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning models when training data is limited or unavailable...|$|R

This paper addresses type related improvements to a shared <b>data</b> grid <b>programming</b> model, {{by taking advantage of}} particular interactions patterns and object semantics which result in a broader set of specialized objects. We present analysis aspects of GUN, a grid service layer solution for shared <b>data</b> <b>programming.</b> We start by defining the evaluation criteria in terms of performance, resource and qualitative aspects. A series of experiments are used in order to highlight relevant behavioral and performance aspects of the model’s implementation. Next, the analysis of the model is carried out at experimental level where a Java based prototype of the grid universe has been built. Starting with the generic objects and followed by every object type, the object particularities are introduced and the experimental results are described and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract —In {{the grid}} context, {{there is little}} support for {{programming}} paradigms such as shared <b>data</b> or associative <b>programming.</b> We have previously proposed an original idea to attack shared <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> on the grid by making use of both relaxed consistency models and user specified type consistency in an object oriented model. In this paper we present the experimental results of GUN, a lightweight Java prototype implementation of our shared <b>data</b> <b>programming</b> model. In order to assess GUN’s performance, some generic experiments are designed. First, GUN’s correctness has been proved in a real grid deployment where {{a limited number of}} nodes were available. In order to observe GUN’s scalability with an increasing number of nodes, experiments have been conducted in a simulated large scale grid environment. The conducted experiments have shown a good scalability of GUN, as well as promising results in terms of response times and usability. I...|$|R

As federal agencies take actions to improve the coverage and usefulness of these programs, it is equally important that the quality and availability of existing data generated by these programs do not erode overtime. In this regard, periodic uninterrupted monitoring to determine conditions and trends is important to accurately describe the extent or seriousness of environmental problems, or conversely, improvements in environmental conditions. GAO reviewed 20 <b>data</b> <b>programs</b> to determine whether federal agencies responsible for the programs anticipate that changes during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 related to funding, shifting priorities, or other factors will affect the ability of the programs to (1) continue to generate data comparable with data from past years, and (2) continue providing data used in a nationwide ecological indicator study by the H.
