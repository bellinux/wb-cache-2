5000|$|XE, GE: 1118cc E1A or 1294cc G1A OHV Simca engine, X {{with three}} doors and G with five doors. The 1118 cc engine {{came with a}} four speed gearbox, whilst the 1294 cc came with a five speed gearbox. Standard {{equipment}} was sparse, featuring a rear bench seat, heated rear window, small wheel centre wheel covers, {{as well as a}} <b>flick</b> <b>wipe</b> facility. Options included a rear wash/wipe, side bump strips on the doors, and a pop up sunroof. Many special editions were based on the X/GE, such as the Sport model, which came with a spoiler and side decals; and also the Sunseeker model, which came with a pop-up sunroof, and side decals. In some markets a diesel E model was also available, using the 1905 cc XUD engine. All diesel models carry the D suffix on the model badge (XLD, GLD). The Special Equipment model available in the UK in 1989 also added a pop up sunroof and a rear wash/wipe to the standard equipment list. The E designation was replaced by the Style designation, which began as a special edition in 1987, but became a part of the range from 1988, to denote the base model, in line with other contemporary Peugeot models of the time (e.g. the Peugeot 205 Style and the Peugeot 405 Style). The Style was also available with the 1124 cc and 1360 cc TU and 1905 cc XUD (Style D) engines, all with 5 speed gearboxes, after the Simca units were phased out.|$|E
