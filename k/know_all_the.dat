5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> capitals of the Third World.|$|E

On both sides of the harbour, the Government has erected taxi ranks catering for those returning taxis prepared to cross the harbour for a single-toll trip.|$|E

25|$|The Mafia's {{protection}} is {{not restricted to}} illegal activities. Shopkeepers often pay the Mafia {{to protect them from}} thieves. If a shopkeeper enters into a protection contract with a mafioso, the mafioso will make it publicly known that if any thief were foolish enough to rob his client's shop, he would track down the thief, beat him up, and, if possible, recover the stolen merchandise (mafiosi make it their business to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fences in their territory).|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} secrecy {{surrounding the}} report {{written by the}} investigation panel from the Department of Civil Aviation attracted strong criticism. After the Minister, Mr Drakeford, announced to the House of Representatives {{that there was no}} need for a public inquiry into the disaster because he and his Department already knew the cause, he was attacked for presuming to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> reasons when the Coroner's inquest was still in progress. An editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail claimed the Minister was trying to avoid public inquiries into aviation accidents. The Attorney-General's decision to withhold the Coroner's report also attracted strong criticism.|$|E
25|$|Also on {{the table}} is a copy of Hansard and where the clerk and deputy clerk sit. The clerk needs to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rules of Parliament and is {{responsible}} for ringing the bells during a division (voting). In front of the clerk are the hour glasses. The outer glasses measure four minutes and the middle glass measures two. These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four minutes. After the hour glass stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of the house for a vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there is a division soon after another division, the middle hour glass will be turned and the bells will ring for two minutes.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{months after}} he joined Port Vale as player-assistant manager in July 2009, Horsfield was offered a {{contract}} at the club as full-time assistant manager. Adams said that Horsfield would have a heavier workload over the 2010–11 season, which would include many hours of scouting in order to [...] "formulate a catalogue of players [...] get to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> leagues at all levels", and he would retain his playing registration for emergencies.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers of mind {{call the}} {{subjective}} aspects of mental events [...] "qualia" [...] or [...] "raw feels". There {{is something that}} {{it is like to}} feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – {{what it is like to}} see the color red.|$|E

It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was so unhappy, because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|Wale {{had wanted}} to {{collaborate}} with Lady Gaga on the track since January 2009, believing that she embodied the party-record feel of the song. He explained: [...] "If music was a high school, I feel like I'll be the dude on the football team, {{and it would be}} like, 'OK, Gaga's having a party!' And you <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bad girls are going to be out there." [...] Upon hearing that some were surprised by the collaboration, Wale went on to say, [...] "If Jay-Z can work with Coldplay, then Wale should be able to work with Gaga." [...] Wale's mentor, Mark Ronson, sent the track to Gaga. She commented that her portion of the song, which includes lyrics such as [...] "Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me/ Eyes all stickin' like honey on bees", is narcissistic, but in a positive way. The lyrics capture the life and image of Wale's home areas Maryland and District of Columbia. About incorporating the hook in the song, Gaga said: ...|$|E
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that be OK? The only problem is, I don't <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E

[...] In addition, he had 208 steals (8th in school history, behind Grant Hill), and had scored 2,077 points (9th on Duke’s all-time list, behind Jason Williams and Gene Banks).

500|$|The Times of India {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 3 out of 5, praising the lead pair and their {{chemistry}} as [...] "vibrant, spontaneous, and a finely nuanced performance". However, it criticised the script and narrative for being trite, saying that [...] "all it promises is some fun moments, a peppy music score by Vishal-Shekhar, [...] alluring performances by Ranbir and Priyanka". Subhash K. Jha wrote another positive review, saying that the film [...] "sets off a tender saucy engaging trip. It somewhere loses its way. But still gets to its targeted destination because of the lead players who appear to <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> signposts and U-turns." [...] He particularly cited Chopra's performance as redeeming the film's flaws, noting that she provided a strong match to Kapoor's talent. Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day gave a rating of 3 out of 5, noting that although the film might not be [...] "a complicated love story, it's still heartfelt and even heartbreaking at times ... A film of this kind is largely dependent on the screenplay and the chemistry between the lead pair. That's what makes [...] unique {{in its own way}} and rather different from what you've seen in the year so far." ...|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> things that you want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
