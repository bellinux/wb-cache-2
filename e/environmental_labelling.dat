These stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the United States and Canada legislated their requirement. Manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use. The automobile industry in North America is required to meet a minimum emissions standard. This led to fuel efficiency labels being placed on new automobiles sold. The major appliance manufacturers were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products. The International Organization for Standardization has developed standards for addressing <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> with the ISO 14000 family which grew out of ISO's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992 ...|$|E
50|$|The ISO 14001 is a {{voluntary}} international standard created in 1996 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and forms {{part of the}} ISO14000 series of environmental standards. This came about {{as a result of}} the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations and the Rio Summit on the Environment held in 1992. At the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations the need to reduce the non-tariff barriers to trade were discussed whereas at the Rio Summit the commitment to protect the environment at an international scale was argued. This brought about the ISO 14001 which allows firms to inform stakeholders of the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS) and specifies the actual requirements for an EMS. The ISO 14001 standard defines EMS as “the general part of management that includes the organizational structure, the activity planning, the responsibilities, the practices, the procedures, the processes and the resources to develop, implement, carry out, and revise the environmental policy and keep it up to date”. Similarly to the FSC ISO 14001 certification can be issued by any third party certification body, (but to prove credibility, such bodies should be accredited (to offer ISO 14001 certification) by organisations such as JAS-ANZ, ANAB, UKAS, and others. These accreditation bodies audit the certification bodies to ensure that the assessment and certification processes are robust and free from conflicts of interest. It provides guidelines and suggestions for matters such as environmental management, environmental auditing, and <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> or lifecycle assessment. It applies to all organisations large or small and covers all sectors if there are environmental aspects that the organisation can control and influence in a positive way. There are other Environmental management system standards that while addressing the requirements of ISO 14001, they have other additional benefits, for example the Eco Warranty standard not only meets the requirements of ISO 14001 but also allows use of the certification logo; this is not allowable with accredited ISO 14001 certification.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is to analyse how companies perceive {{the costs and benefits}} from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> The project only covers two labels: - the Nordic ‘Swan’ and the European ‘Flower’. The majority of the companies have to high or some extent achieved their objectives regarding the labels. Moreover, most companies believe that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> improves image. One third of the companies state that the benefits from labelling exceed the costs they have encountered. However, {{more than half of the}} companies do not feel that they have gained important advantages from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling,</b> e. g. from additional sales and earnings. With regards to the costs, <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> does not necessitate high investments in new technology, recruitments, education etc. In other words, the cost barriers are in general small and most companies are able to defray the costs of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> In conclusion, most companies have at least to some extent achieved their goals, whereas the economic impacts from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> have so far been limited. This does not necessarily imply that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> is without importance. On the contrary, environmental labels hold a number of potentials that make them attractive to companies. However, the prospects of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> depend on the values, attitudes and behaviour of all relevant stakeholders. Based on the results from the project, we have listed a number of recommendations for the companies, the customers and the administrators, which might stimulate the future development of environmentally labelled goods and services: * Companies. Even though companies in general do not experience substantial advantages from <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling,</b> the labels might have a number of indirect effects, which might increase the companies’ competitiveness in the long run. For instance, <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> might improve the companies’ image and serve as a door opener for Side 5 Miljømærker og effekter new markets. Furthermore, the costs of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> are very limited. However, companies also have to realise that <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> is not a panacea, which automatically generates a number of positive impacts. * Customers. It is often concluded that customers care about the environment and are willing to pay a price premium for environmentalfriendly goods and services. However, this is not always the case. The results indicate that the customers’ actual purchasing behaviour is not necessarily in accordance with ‘green’ purchasing policies. For instance, a number of companies have experienced that the public procurement practises are inconsistent with formal policies. Realising that the public sector is the driver of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> much has to be done in order to improve the public procurement: - e. g. through education, campaigns and political action. * Administrators. In general, companies are not pleased with the fee structure of the labelling schemes. They think it would be fairer to impose the fees on the companies who do not produce eco-labelled products. Moreover, when eco-labels in general do not increase profit of products and services, the fees inevitable become an impediment to the future growth of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling.</b> In general, there is a need to align the fee structure as well as the administrative procedures to the actual costs and advantages of <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling...</b>|$|E

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Environmental</b> <b>labels</b> on products and services have been increasingly significant in influencing consumer purchasing and represent a crucial communication of the environmental credentials of products and companies. Yet their importance to industrial designers, who are recognised as having significant influence over {{the environmental impact of}} products, is less known. The overall aim of this research project is to investigate factors affecting the implementation of UK <b>environmental</b> <b>labels</b> by in-house industrial designers in UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). A review of the literature on industrial designers and <b>environmental</b> <b>labels</b> found that there was a gap in knowledge surrounding the factors affecting how and whether in-house industrial designers implement labels in their work, and what understanding they have. In response to the literature review a number of research questions were generated, which influenced the direction of this emergent, exploratory research. A Preliminary Study was set up to collect qualitative data from practicing industrial designers in UK SMEs on their recognition and use of <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> schemes. A mock-up Resource was consequently developed that provided the information the Preliminary Study participants claimed to need. During the Main Study the Resource was used as an elicitation tool to further probe designers‟ understanding and use of labels. Subsequently, three Case Studies were conducted with UK SMEs who have implemented labels on their products, to identify elements of best practice. The in-house SME designers in the study appeared to have knowledge of <b>environmental</b> <b>label</b> types and schemes. Both this and designers‟ position within their companies especially in terms of their input on design briefs moderates their ability to implement labels. The cooperation and contribution of colleagues is also significant to the effective application including driving their use and being willing to include them in the product development process from early stages to impact on success or effectiveness. It is suggested that a whole company approach is needed.

The paper therefore presents a systematic process of developing an <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> framework {{as an extension of}} carbon labelling using the fairtrade certification as a platform to facilitate the process. Using the general theoretical constructs of lifecycle assessments, the framework presented provides insight into the formulation of multi-regional supply chains which has been specifically characterised in this paper for the UK–India–Rest of the World supply chain. The <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> process presented in this paper is based on two key principles; Quantitative Principle in Eco-labelling and the Principle of Whole Lifecycle Perspective and it is used to inform two key stakeholder groups in the supply chain: consumers and supply chain partners. For consumers, a consistent way of presenting the environmental label information is presented highlighting the supply chain impacts across the indicators of CO 2 -eq emissions, water consumption and land use in addition to regional contributions to these impacts from a global supply chain perspective. Additionally, communicating the environmental impacts to supply chain partners provides a decision support to take actions to reduce the overall impacts by identifying processes within the global supply chain that needed prioritisation. Given that fairtrade partnership is based on participatory development and a strict guidelines and standardisation process, it is envisaged that synergies can be derived by integrating <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> with the fairtrade scheme to enhance the environmental sustainability of product supply chains...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the debate on <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> by exploring the potential of economic value as a functional unit (FU) for the <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> of food and other consumer products. We used life cycle inventory (LCI) data for organic and conventional pigs and broiler chickens from the public French AGRIBALYSE LCI database and the CML 2001 method to calculate impacts per ton of animal live weight at the farm gate, per hectare (ha) of land occupied and per 1000 Euro of animal live weight. We also examined the relationship between carbon footprint (CF) and price for 24 food product groups representative of French food consumption. When using the FU live weight, organic animals had larger impacts than conventional animals. Per ha of land occupied, organic animals had smaller impacts than conventional animals, but production was lower. Per 1000 Euro of value, organic animals had similar or lower values for eutrophication, lower values for climate change and higher or similar values for land occupation. These results illustrate that the choice of FU is crucial when comparing products from highly efficient conventional systems to products from less intensive organic systems. For the 24 food product groups CF per product mass was positively correlated with product price; CF per product economic value was not correlated with product price. This suggests that a rebound effect may occur: consumers that choose foods with lower CFs per mass will tend to spend less money on food, leaving them with more money to buy other products which may compensate the reduced food CF. This type of correlation has not been observed for non-food sectors of the economy. Nevertheless, the FU economic value is attractive, as it considers product quality through the product's price. An economic-value-based FU will be more favourable to systems producing products of superior quality. More generally, an economic-value-based FU is well suited for <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> of consumer products. A consumer has a certain budget to spend; an economic-value-based FU may guide the consumer towards reduced impacts per Euro spent. We recommend the use of an FU based on economic value for the <b>environmental</b> <b>labelling</b> of food and other consumer products. This FU will be a complement to currently used FUs. It will guide consumers towards lower impacts for a given expenditure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
