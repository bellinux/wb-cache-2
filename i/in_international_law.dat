5|$|Targeted Killing <b>in</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} of targeted killing, written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008.

Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E
