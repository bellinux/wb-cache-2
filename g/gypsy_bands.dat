25|$|Up {{until the}} 1920s the duda was the {{preferred}} instrument at celebrations {{in much of}} Hungary. As the Hungarian economy improved and the pastoral lifestyle declined in importance, the lone piper at a country ball or wedding was increasingly replaced by professional <b>Gypsy</b> <b>bands</b> (cigányzenekar) that played an urban repertoire on more complex and capable instruments. The Hungarian bagpipe was essentially extinct except in small pockets by the 1950s but was “rescued” {{as part of the}} Hungarian folk revival, and is today a very popular instrument among Hungarian folk bands and their fans.|$|E

60|$|Over {{against my}} tenting place {{a colony of}} herons had their nests in some dark hemlocks. They were {{interesting}} as a camp of gypsies, some going off in straggling bands to the coast at daybreak, others frogging in the streams, and a few solitary, patient, philosophical ones joining me daily in following the gentle art of Izaak Walton. And then, when the sunset came and the deep red glowed just behind the hemlocks, and the <b>gypsy</b> <b>bands</b> came home, I would see their sentinels posted here and there among the hemlock tips--still, dark, graceful silhouettes etched in sepia against the gorgeous after-glow--and hear the mothers croaking their ungainly babies {{to sleep in the}} tree tops.|$|E

50|$|Liszt {{incorporated}} many themes he {{had heard}} in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written {{by members of the}} Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits, often played by Roma (<b>Gypsy)</b> <b>bands.</b> The large scale structure of each was influenced by the verbunkos, a Hungarian dance in several parts, each with a different tempo. Within this structure, Liszt preserved the two main structural elements of typical Gypsy improvisation—the lassan ("slow") and the friska ("fast"). At the same time, Liszt incorporated a number of effects unique to the sound of <b>Gypsy</b> <b>bands,</b> especially the pianistic equivalent of the cimbalom. He also makes much use of the Hungarian gypsy scale.|$|E

The goal is for the Bulgarians to live in fear, to be discouraged, crushed, submissive. Hundreds of thousands of chronically ill are dying right now because mob companies of the previous cabinet make dirty deals with the life and health of the Bulgarians.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of the music making of the Roma in Hungary from {{the second half of the}} 18 th century to 2005. The author divides the historical genres performed by Roma into the so-called Gypsy music played by <b>Gypsy</b> <b>bands</b> for outsiders and the Romani folk music for internal using of the Romani communities. The performers of the Gypsy music came mostly from Romungro families and their music served as the national music for the Hungarians in the 18 th and 19 th centuries to be turned into a part of the popular music in the 20 th century. The music of the Romani communities, the folk music, is mostly not instrumental and in the case of the dance songs the performers produce vocal substitutes of the orchestral sound. A new chapter of the Romani music making has started from the 1980 s with the first success of the Romani emancipation movement. The Romani rap music from 1997 and the Romani pop music from 2000 have formed on the urban scene. In the villages, the Romani ballroom music has been fashionable since the middle of the 1990 s. The author emphasizes the growing internationalization of the most recent music played by the Hungarian Roma.
