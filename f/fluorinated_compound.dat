Poisoning by D. cymosum results in the deaths of many domestic livestock each year due to the presence of fluoroacetate. The aim of the study was to determine if monofluoroacetate or another <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compound</b> is present in T. fischeri, and the possible role endophytes might play in the production of these compounds. Through NMR and GCMS studies it was established that trifluoroacetate is present in T. fischeri. Bacterial endophytes were isolated from plant material and shown to produce a <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compound</b> other than mono and trifluoroacetate. Since trifluoroacetic acid is extremely volatile, and evaporate from the plant extract over time, column chromatography, together with NMR was employed to isolate and identify other compounds responsible for antibacterial activity against the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis previously observed on TLC plates. Two compounds were isolated, and identified with NMR as a fatty acid and a fatty acid attached to glycerol. The names of the compounds could not be established with GCMS due to insufficient derivatization of the compounds. The antibacterial activity of the compounds were also analyzed using 96 well microtitre plates in liquid media, where it was determined that the compounds do not have antibacterial activity against E. faecalis. This indicated that previous results on TLC plates were false positives due to the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acid compounds. Transmission electron microscopy was done on leaf material to determine the presence of bacterial endophytes in the intracellular spaces of plant material, but none was detected.

Conclusions and future directions. Fruit fly species have a devastating impact on food production in Australia and other countries. With new {{restrictions on the}} use of certain organophosphate insecticides, other control methods, such as male annihilation technique (MAT), will be more important for crop protection. MAT depends on effective male lures to attract pests to toxicants. Zingerone is a natural product that is attractive to males of Bactrocera jarvisi, a species that responds only weakly to other lures. In a step towards more effective lures, a series of zingerone analogues were synthesised and characterised. Many analogues were synthesised by an Aldol-hydrogenation synthetic route. Volatility is considered an important factor in lure attraction and the measurement of the volatility of the analogues by differential scanning calorimetry showed that <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> have a 7 - 10 -fold greater vapour pressure than corresponding non-fluorinated compounds. Unexpectedly, the acetyl and formyl esters of zingerone were half as volatile as zingerone. Electroantennography experiments with B. tryoni and B. jarvisi indicated that <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> generally produce a greater response and the two species have vastly different preferences for the methylenedioxy moiety.

40|$|International audienceIn this review, {{we report}} on superhydrophobic and superoleophobic {{properties}} found in nature, which are strongly expected to benefit various potential applications. Mimicry of nature is {{the easiest way to}} reproduce such properties because nature has for millennia produced plants, insects and animals able to repel water as well as low surface tension liquids such as oils. The most famous example is the lotus leaf, but we may also consider insects able to walk on vertical surfaces or on the water surface, insects with colored structured wings or insects with antifogging and anti-reflective eyes. Most of the time, nature produces nanostructured waxes to obtain superhydrophobic properties. Very recently, the repellency of oils has been reported in springtails, for example. While several publications have reported the fabrication of superoleophobic surfaces using re-entrant geometry, in all of these publications <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds</b> were used because they have high hydrophobic properties but also relatively important oleophobic properties in comparison to hydrocarbon analogs even if they are intrinsically oleophilic. However, nature is not able to synthesize <b>fluorinated</b> <b>compounds.</b> In the case of the springtails, the surface structures consists of regular patterns with negative overhangs. The chemical composition of the cuticles is composed of three different layers: an inner cuticle layer made of a lamellar chitin skeleton with numerous pore channels, an epicuticular structures made of structural proteins such glycine (more than 50 %), tyrosine and serine an the topmost envelope composed of lipids such as hydrocarbon acids and esters, steroids and terpenes.
