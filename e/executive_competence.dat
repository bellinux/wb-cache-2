30|$|Second, {{in terms}} of competences and powers in {{migration}} control, the national level dominates sub-national authorities in both countries.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThis paper {{seeks to}} answer the {{following}} question: how can municipalities manage and regulate markets in a manner that facilitates access to food and contributes to the enhancement of food security? In attempting to answer this question, the paper will also address the following questions: what does the term 'food security' mean? What does 'access to food' mean? What does the 'right to food' mean? What are the powers and functions of local government? What are the limits, problems or risks attached to the exercise of these powers? What constitutes 'markets' or 'fresh produce markets' in this case? What is the scope of local government's legislative and <b>executive</b> <b>competence</b> regarding food 'markets', as enumerated in Part B of Schedule 5 of the Constitution? And, how can municipalities utilise food markets as a means to facilitate access to food and address the issue of food security? This paper will focus primarily on fresh produce markets, as opposed to other markets or 'markets' in their entirety. This limitation is based on the argument that fresh produce markets are more relevant for the role of local government in facilitating access to food because they provide a platform for the sale and purchase of fresh produce, which is important for nutritional purposes. The argument presented in this thesis centres around the facilitation of access to food, by local government, through the regulation and management of markets. The paper will address the problem by examining the concepts of 'food security' and 'access to food' in the South African context, {{as well as in the}} international context. In examining the above concepts, the paper will also include the right to food. The paper will further look at how South Africa has responded to the issue of food security through its national food security policies. The paper will look at how local food markets are utilised internationally to facilitate access to food and thereafter, examine how food markets should be utilised to facilitate access to food in South Africa. Thereafter, an examination of the powers and functions of local government as entrenched in the Constitution will be provided, as well as the implications of such powers, the limitations and the problems attached to the exercise of local government powers. Lastly, the paper looks at local government's competence regarding food 'markets' in Schedule 5 B of the Constitution, as well as the other competencies related to food/food security. Although local government has the scope to address the issue of food security by exercising its legislative and executive authority over the competence ‘markets’ as per Schedule 5 B of the Constitution, this study does not focus solely on the management and regulation of 'markets'. The study extends and includes related competencies such as trade regulations, the licensing and control of undertakings that sell food to the public, municipal abattoirs, street trading and municipal health service, and shows how the links between these competencies provide local government with the opportunity to contribute to the enhancement of food security...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the French-African Communauté {{is more than just}} historical. Indeed, the present French-African relationship is not completely understandable without a knowledge of the Community, which was created by the constitution of the fifth French Republic (1958). President de Gaulle, who was its inspirator, realised that in the changing world the relationship between France and its colonial territories had to be adapted. The French-African Community was a federal structure in which the French-speaking territories south of the Sahara became autonomous republics. Yet their autonomy was substantially restricted: foreign affairs, defense, the economic and financial policy, justice, higher education, the policy concerning raw materials (e. g. uranium and oil), and the organisation of international transport and telecommunication were reserved for the federal institutions. Although four institutions were created within the Community (the Presidency, the Executive Board, the Senate and the Court of Arbitration), only the Presidency had real power: the exclusive legislative and <b>executive</b> <b>competence</b> in all Community matters. The function of Community President was reserved for the French President. Therefore it can undoubtedly be said that the French-African Community was not a genuine federal structure, but merely a constitutional arrangement which ensured France the exclusive control over its former African colonies. The African political leaders were also aware of this and claimed the abolition of the. French-African Community. Using the possibility for change, provided by the 78 th article of the constitution, they demanded independence by the transfer of all reserved competences (1960). In order to avoid any rupture, France accepted on the condition that bilateral cooperation agreements would be signed simultaneously. These agreements, which were revised halfway the seventies and which are still in force today, provide France with an unique position in Africa. No former métropole has a comparable influence in Africa. Besides, the French-African Conference, which is organised anually since 1973, gives France an excellent forum to influence and control the policy of African states. At this Conference almost every former French colonie in Africa is present, some Belgian, British, Spanish and Portuguese territories participate as well. Moreover, the cooperation agreements explicitly allow France to maintain large troups in Africa and to give support by military intervention whenever it is necessary. France's strict control over {{one of the most important}} attributes of state sovereignity, namely defense, increases largely the already acuted dependency on Paris. Yet, the economic position of most of the former French colonies and territories in Africa is the best illustration of their present dependence. Still today more than 40 % of their trade is realised with the former métropole (export: raw materials; import: finished goods). Moreover, most of them are members of the so-called "zone franc", a monetary zone which is completely controlled by the French authorities. The good relationship between France and Africa remained as a result of which extensive bilateral cooperation agreements could be signed within the framework of the French-African Community. This continuity has always been one of the main characteristics of the French policy in Africa...|$|E
30|$|Researchers {{differ in}} {{relation}} to the dimensions that comprise the <b>executive</b> <b>competences.</b> For example, Lado and Wilson (1994 : 703) solely distinguish two dimensions: the outline of a strategic vision and the establishment of a beneficial link with the environment. Lado et al. (1992), however, identify a third dimension, leadership, independently of the dimension of the strategic vision. Camisón (2002) integrates these models, proposing five dimensions in the executive competences: (1) Strategic approach. The strategic approach is the executive capability to outline a strategic vision that supports the development of the organizational resources and establish a beneficial organization-environment link. (2) Qualification of the executives: This includes their talent, technical and management knowledge, their ability to solve problems, and make decisions and their experience. (3) Personality of the executives. This dimension alludes to the executives’ knowledge about themselves, their capability to control their own behavior and emotions, and the values and standards that motivate them, which condition their social model and conduct. (4) Executive mentality. Orientation of the managers {{in relation to}} achievement, time use, change and innovation, as well as risk (revealing their perspective when facing risk). (5) Effective leadership. This alludes to the management style and leadership ability to communicate the strategic vision (a clear vision of the organization’s future) {{to the members of the}} organization and to delegate power to the employees to carry it out, achieving their enthusiastic commitment.|$|R

Yengeni filed a review application against sentence on the basis that the NDPP and Minister of Justice had agreed {{to see to it that}} he would be sentenced to no more than a fine of R5,000 if he pleaded guilty to fraud. The court held that, even if an agreement had been concluded as alleged, it would have been fundamentally incapable of being performed, as any attempt to fetter the court's discretion on sentence would be in conflict with the fundamental constitutional principle of the independence of the judiciary. It would also blur the clear distinction between a prosecutorial decision, which was part of the <b>executive's</b> <b>competence,</b> and the sentencing power, which was a judicial power. The court expressed disgust at the possibility that such an agreement could have been concluded, as the NDPP ought to be impartial and not politically motivated. The court noted that the purported agreement was to be distinguished from a plea-bargaining agreement, since the latter was expressly subject to the court's finding that the agreement was just, which decision was made by the court independently of the parties to the agreement. The review application was therefore dismissed.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the impact of}} consociational power-sharing in the democratization of Kosovo. Consociational {{democracy}} as a model aims to bridge the ethnic divide under a democratic system of government. In post-conflict cases power-sharing is arranged though institutionalized representation quotas for minorities. Consociational democracy as a model of governance has been mostly successful in already well established democracies. Power-sharing in Kosovo was applied with a top-down approach by international actors as a form of conflict resolution and inter-ethnic reconciliation at the elite/leadership level. Such an approach has, to some extent, ignored the lack of democratic tradition characterized with a socialist/communist past under Yugoslavia, in addition to ignoring the severe lack of trust and inter-ethnic communication at the grassroots level between the majority Albanians and minority Serbs. Following the theory of historical institutionalism the finding is that lack of democratization in Kosovo is path dependent and thus 'history matters' in the process of institutional building. Under the conditions of no statehood, the international actors have held <b>executive</b> <b>competences</b> as being the supreme authority, while lacking democratic legitimacy and accountability. Thus, at the time of constitutional design, decision-makers found themselves at the crossroads, or 'critical junctures', knowing that given the nature of the conflict, the path taken might be irreversible. Additionally, upon deciding consociational power-sharing, it was carried out without possessing adequate socio-demographic data and uncertainty of a final status for Kosovo. Therefore, the approach can be considered experimental. In sum, given the aforementioned nature of consociational power-sharing combined with a number of factors, such as path-dependency, a complex system of governance, uncertainly of the final status and lack of inter-ethnic reconciliation at the grassroots level, the conclusion is that this approach has not had any significant impact on the democratization of Kosovo. According to numerous reports, Kosovo’s democracy in general faces many problems – thus, against other goals democracy remained a second priority...|$|R

40|$|The classic debate {{surrounding}} the prolific {{role of the}} European Union in defining spheres of competence and power relationships has long divided scholarly opinion.

There is a widespread perception of a competence problem in Europe and the overabundance of provisions limiting the Union's competences is one of the most obvious marks left by the Lisbon Treaty. This book discusses the extent to which the parameters of power throughout the Union and its Member States have been recast by the recent implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and doctrines developed by the European Court of Justice. Comprised of contributions from a vast array of leading practitioners and academics in the field of EU Law, this volume assesses the debate {{surrounding the}} political identity of the European Union, and further illustrates the relevance of the Federal theory of sharing competences for the development of EU Law. Finally, the question of new potential limits to Union's competence is addressed. If anything, this broad reflection on the notion of competence in the EU law context is a way of opening up the question of the nature and contours of the political identity of the European Union.

In history, before separating <b>executive</b> and juridical <b>competences,</b> consistories of Lutheran state churches with central executive powers, therefore usually consisting of jurisprudents and clergy, did also function as courts appointed to regulate ecclesiastical affairs. At times the consistories were parastatal offices in charge of all (Protestant) denominations (e.g. in Bremen-Verden) or even all religions (e.g. in Prussia, see Evangelical Church in Prussia from 1808 to 1816) in the respective territory. While Lutheran churches often still did not form legal entities distinct from the state, the consistories {{turned out to be the}} oldest body of many modern regional Protestant church bodies, which developed into independent legal entities in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
