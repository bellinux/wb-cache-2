5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|As Marek and {{his team}} search for Johnston in the past, they find {{themselves}} forced to rely deeply on one another for their basic safety.

25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, {{if he did not}} have some kind of function.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} Rosa story {{featuring}} The Three Caballeros, Donald Duck is {{shocked by the}} sight of a capybara standing on its hind legs, with shrubs, leaves and fruit in front of its body, coincidentally making it look like Mickey Mouse. José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey can be seen among them.|$|E
25|$|He also is {{the only}} Baldrick to confront Blackadder after being hit; he does so on one occasion, and is very {{conscious}} of class divisions. While this briefly attracts him to the ideals of Bolshevism, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as willing to marry General Melchett if it allows him to escape his lower-class status. His family seem to worship Lord Flashheart, declaring that they all took up smoking to collect cigarette cards bearing his image and that his grandmother smoked herself to death so they could afford the album.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 2008, his boast did {{not come}} true, as Kansas won the return match in Lawrence, 88–74 despite 39 points and 11 rebounds from Beasley. He matched a Big 12 record by equaling former Kansas player Drew Gooden's record for most double-doubles in a season (25). With his 33-point, 14-rebound effort against Colorado on March 4, he eclipsed Mitch Richmond's 20-year-old school single-season points record (768; 1987–88), while he broke the Big 12 record for double-doubles in a season with his 26th for the year. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the 27th player in NCAA Division I history to post 26 or more double-doubles in a season and the first since Utah's Andrew Bogut (26) did it in 2004–05.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{note here}} that, for example, in Christianity (and {{even more in}} Judaism, where God is {{represented}} as talking to Job and explaining why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just),</b> God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, {{there is a problem}} about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.|$|E
25|$|Alek {{is unable}} to stomach letting {{the crew of the}} Leviathan suffer out on the ice, and {{secretly}} leaves the fortress to bring medicine to the crew of the fallen ship. The first person he finds is an unconscious Deryn, who had fallen from the rigging during the crash. Alek revives her and claims unconvincingly to be a Swiss villager. Deryn is suspicious of him and sounds the alarm, resulting in Alek’s capture. Alek continues to insist <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> a bystander trying help, but the captain refuses to release him and instead leaves him under Deryn’s charge. The secret cargo brought by Dr. Barlow is revealed to be eggs of some kind, though most were destroyed in the crash.|$|E
25|$|The mortal Lutin arrives. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as enchanted {{with the}} fairies as Sir Ethais and Sir Phyllon were in Act I, {{and they are}} {{similarly}} impressed with him. Lutin is so taken with Fairyland that he calls it Paradise and assumes he must be dead. The fairies explain the situation, and they all vie for his attention, saying that they prefer his rugged appearance to men that are handsome. Zayda persuades all the other fairies to find food for Lutin. When they have left, she tells him {{that all of the}} other fairies have faults, and that she is the only fairy worthy of his esteem. When the other fairies return, they ask Lutin if he has a wife. He replies that he is married down below, but is a bachelor in Fairyland, which offends Zayda.|$|E

25|$|His ankle {{problems}} {{became so}} severe {{years later that}} he had both his ankles surgically fused. His saga of injury and failed rehabs {{was connected to the}} use of painkillers by the doctor who was assigned to his case. Walton has said repeatedly in his broadcasts that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as much to blame for taking the medication as the doctor was for giving it to him. In a June 8, 2010 interview on The Dan Patrick Show, Walton admitted to contemplating suicide for a time due to the constant pain resulting from injuries sustained during his NBA career. Walton's injuries, along with his 1978–1979 year-long protest, gave him an unpleasant, if not odd, record of missing the most games during an NBA playing career, when taking into account the number of years he was officially listed as a player on a team roster.|$|E
25|$|Hisame is Shigure's step brother. He {{often gets}} jealous when seeing Shigure and Mami together. On the outside Hisame is bad mannered, {{but on the}} inside he is {{actually}} quite a good boy. He teases Mami but likes her secretly. He felt jealousy when Akira agreed {{to go out with}} Mami and tried to destroy their relationship but failed. Hisame becomes attached to Yukina whenever Mami rejects him. Later on, it is shown that they have warmed up to each other and Yukina also encourages Hisame's crush on Mami. Hisame recently confessed his love to Mami. After being rejected he turns to Yukina and makes her his toy to play with. He also threatens to tell Shigure about the identity of Yupina (handle name of Yukina). He is secretly Dolche, Yukina's rival in her novel. He shows to have a crush on Yukina although he thinks that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> replacing Yukina for Mami.|$|E
25|$|At the loft, Regina has a {{chat with}} Henry about Emma, and tells him {{that he should be}} proud of his mother for having magic, then heals his ear. Henry mourns {{the fact that he is}} normal and has no special powers, but Regina insists that he {{possesses}} the heart of the truest believer and tells him that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as powerful as either one of his mothers, even without magic. Regina then goes downstairs to talk to Mary Margaret and David after overhearing that they believe Emma is doing the right thing in getting rid of her powers. Regina talks them out of it by saying that her powers are part of her and that they are her gift. She insists that she only needs to channel it the right way and use it to protect the town. The two eventually agree with Regina and as they decide to search again for their daughter, they notice that the locator spell and Emma's scarf missing. Then, they also notice that Elsa is gone.|$|E
