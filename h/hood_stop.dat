50|$|The Caesars began play in 1992, in {{competition}} with the cross-town Nottingham Hoods. The Hoods saw some success including a conference championship in 1992 {{under the leadership of}} import players Mike Grossner and Vic Quirolo. The <b>Hoods</b> <b>stopped</b> play in 1994, and this boosted the Caesars considerably, who then posted an undefeated 10-0 record in 1995. Since then, the Caesars have seen moderate success, with 3 conference championships including a trip to the Britbowl in 1997, ending in defeat to the Redbridge Fire 26-7.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>Hood</b> <b>stopped</b> buying {{milk from}} the farms involved, they {{approached}} several other companies, including Horizon Organic, Stonyfield Farm and Organic Valley, {{as well as}} local producers, about the possibility of selling milk to them, but were rejected. In April 2009, the group made an agreement with Smiling Hill Farm, a local milk producer, for processing, and Oakhurst Dairy agreed to transport the products. Funding for MOOMilk, which needed $500,000 to begin operations, was provided by the state of Maine, as well as from private sources, including Stonyfield Farm. At its beginning, MOOMilk sold milk to Hannaford, Associated Grocers of Maine and dozens of independent stores in Maine.|$|R

6000|$|Now news {{had been}} brought to Robin Hood how that Little John, instead of doing his bidding, had passed by duty for pleasure, and so had stopped {{overnight}} with merry company at the Blue Boar Inn, instead of going straight to Ancaster. So, being vexed to his heart by this, he set forth at dawn of day to seek Little John at the Blue Boar, or at least to meet the yeoman on the way, and ease his heart of what he thought of the matter. As thus he strode along in anger, putting together the words he would use to chide Little John, he heard, of a sudden, loud and angry voices, as of men in a rage, passing fell words back and forth from one to the other. At this, Robin <b>Hood</b> <b>stopped</b> and listened. [...] "Surely," [...] quoth he to himself, [...] "that is Little John's voice, and he is talking in anger also. Methinks the other is strange to my ears. Now Heaven forfend that my good trusty Little John should have fallen {{into the hands of the}} King's rangers. I must see to this matter, and that quickly." ...|$|R
50|$|There are gables {{above the}} windows over the aisles {{and above the}} {{polygonal}} apse, with Greek crosses carved into them. The tracery is decorated, including the large west window. It has geometric tracery with an arched doorway below. Included with the windows are <b>hood</b> moulds to <b>stop</b> rainwater hitting the stonework below.|$|R
5000|$|Dick Grayson, on {{assignment}} for Spyral, teams up with Tim Drake (Red Robin) and Jason Todd (Red <b>Hood)</b> to <b>stop</b> a cyborg cyclist. Later, he is {{attacked by a}} group of children and his own field handler, both claiming to act on behalf of someone called [...] "Mother". Running away, he meets a nearly silent young woman who also says one word - [...] "Mother", but instead of attempting to kill him, she deliberately holds back and gives him a Bat-flashdrive containing a confession from Batman, as well as a list of names. The recording identifies the young woman as Cassandra Cain.|$|R
6000|$|The {{afternoon}} was already well-nigh gone when Robin Hood, Little John, Will, and Allan set forth upon their homeward way, trudging along merrily through the yellow slanting light, which speedily changed to rosy red {{as the sun}} sank low in the heavens. The shadows grew long, and finally merged into the grayness of the mellow twilight. The dusty highway lay all white betwixt the dark hedgerows, and along it walked four fellows like four shadows, the pat of their feet sounding loud, and their voices, as they talked, ringing clear upon {{the silence of the}} air. The great round moon was floating breathlessly up in the eastern sky when they saw before them the twinkling lights of Barnet Town, some ten or twelve miles from London. Down they walked through the stony streets and past the cosy houses with overhanging gables, before the doors of which sat the burghers and craftsmen in the mellow moonlight, with their families about them, and so came at last, {{on the other side of}} the hamlet, to a little inn, all shaded with roses and woodbines. Before this inn Robin <b>Hood</b> <b>stopped,</b> for the spot pleased him well. Quoth he, [...] "Here will we take up our inn and rest for the night, for we are well away from London Town and our King's wrath. Moreover, if I mistake not, we will find sweet faring within. What say ye, lads?" ...|$|R
25|$|The loss of Robin <b>Hood</b> did not <b>stop</b> de Mestre from {{transporting}} horses by sea to Melbourne {{to compete}} in the Melbourne Cup. In the next two years de Mestre won two more Melbourne Cups with Chester in 1877 and Calamia in 1878. Having then won 5 Melbourne Cups established his place in history as Australia's first outstanding racehorse trainer.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a large four-stage tower at its western end. The tower {{features}} a doorway and a four-light window which has, like the other principal windows of the church, flowing tracery. There are three clocks in the third stage of the tower on its north, south and west faces under a gable containing flowing tracery. In the belfry stage the opening on each face is a two-light reticulated window. The tower has diagonal buttresses to its west face, and a NE stair turret which rises above the plain parapets {{of the top of}} the tower. The aisles have lean-to roofs and above these, sandwiched in a narrow band below the eaves of the nave, is a clerestory with circular windows with alternating triskele and mouchette-and-quatrefoil infilling. The aisle windows are broad and have flowing tracery in the three lights, alternating in design in each bay. The southern chapel and northern vestry/organ chamber lie under their own gables and have florid three-light fenestration similar to that in the aisles. Both porches have moulded outer doorways. The northern porch is vaulted. An unusual feature of the exterior walls is the widespread traces of former putlog holes, no doubt used for the scaffolding during the construction of the building. These are often found on medieval buildings but were usually carefully filled in and obliterated on Victorian ones. Here they are made a feature of with the side pieces and cappings clearly evident. The <b>hood</b> <b>stops</b> of the arch heads have nearly all been left uncarved.|$|R
50|$|Robin Hood and Little John are hunting {{when they}} see a finely dressed {{stranger}} shoot a deer. Robin says if he accepts it, he can be a yeoman in their band. The stranger threatens him, and forbids him to sound his horn. They aim arrows at each other, and Robin proposes that they fight with swords instead. They strike some blows. Robin asks him who he is, and he is Young Gamwell, and, because he killed his father's steward, he is seeking his uncle, who is called Robin <b>Hood.</b> That <b>stops</b> their fight, and they join the band. Little John asks why he is gone so long, and Robin says they were fighting, but Little John must not fight him. He names his nephew Scarlet.|$|R
50|$|The {{controversy}} over the <b>hoods</b> did not <b>stop</b> the Theological Department becoming affiliated to Durham University in 1876, allowing holders of the Theological AKC to take Durham BAs with only a year of residence in Durham. This {{and the addition of}} evening classes to the Theological Department enabled it to recover from only 24 students in 1876 to 79 in 1881, overtaking the General Department, which fell to 39 students in 1884.|$|R
5000|$|JIM (launched as JIMtv in 2001) was a Flemish {{television}} channel of the Medialaan (Roularta/De Persgroep) that {{is aimed at}} people aged between 15 and 24. Its name is a backronym for [...] "Jong, Interactief en Meer" [...] (English: Young, Interactive and More). During its first years, the channel mainly broadcast music videos. They have since started mixing this with programs such as Brainiac and Snoop Dogg's Father <b>Hood.</b> The channel <b>stopped</b> broadcasting on December 16, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera pans}} across Springfield. The {{driveway}} scene remains {{almost exactly the}} same, except Marge's car now hits Homer and carries him on the <b>hood</b> until it <b>stops</b> short, flinging him ahead to smash a Homer-shaped hole through the door. The Simpsons run {{into the living room}} and a couch gag is shown, before the credits are displayed on a new widescreen flat panel television, which falls to the floor and breaks. Unlike the previous opening sequences, there is no cut to black and the episode begins immediately.Sometimes, the flat panel television does not fall to the floor and break, but unlike [...] "Bart Gets a Z", the episode will begin then anyway.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a second}} lieutenant, at the Battle of Antietam, his {{artillery}} {{were the first}} deployed into the Cornfield, helping to <b>stop</b> <b>Hood's</b> Division. When the commanding officer Captain Joseph B. Campbell was wounded, Stewart took command. [...] Stewart commanded the 4th U.S., Battery B, the only regular artillery battery of I Corps during the Battle of Gettysburg. This battery also suffered the highest overall casualty figure of any I Corps battery. [...] During {{the first day of}} fighting at Gettysburg, Stewart was placed in front of the Thompson House, supported by three regiments from Pennsylvanians. [...] On August 1, 1864, he was brevetted captain for [...] "gallant services at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and during the present campaign before Richmond..." ...|$|R
50|$|A British {{expedition}} of 3,000 troops sailed from Saint Lucia on 30 January 1781. Rodney {{left behind}} ships {{to monitor the}} French on Martinique. He also sent Samuel <b>Hood</b> ahead to <b>stop</b> any merchant ships escaping from the harbour. The main force arrived off St. Eustatius on 3 February. Rodney's ships took up position to neutralise any shore batteries. Two or three shots were fired from the only Dutch warship on the roadstead, the frigate Mars under Captain Count Van Bijland. Instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney {{sent a message to}} Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. De Graaff agreed to the proposal and surrendered. De Graaff had ten guns in Fort Orange and sixty soldiers. Rodney had over 1,000 guns on his ships. By the following day the nearby islands of Saint Martin and Saba had also surrendered.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{constructed}} in yellow sandstone with angle buttresses. It has a west door above {{which is a}} <b>hood</b> mould, its <b>stops</b> carved with faces. Over this is a window containing Geometric tracery. Higher on the tower are more windows, {{some of which are}} lancets, and others have trefoil heads. On each side of the tower are clock faces, which are set in diapered panels. The top stage contains louvred triple-lancet bell openings. On the summit of the tower is a stepped and gabled parapet, with octagonal crocketed pinnacles at the corners. Originally the tower had an iron crown that had been made in the railway workshops. In the tower is a ring of ten bells, all of which were cast in 1912 by Gillett & Johnston. Some of the ruined walls of the church remain, including red brick fragments from the chancel. A garden has been created within the walls, which contains a pair of octagonal iron piers, the former supports of the galleries.|$|R

5000|$|Dunne met John Thomas Sweeney, {{a cooking}} {{hand at the}} {{restaurant}} Ma Maison, {{at a party in}} 1981. After a few weeks of dating, they moved into a one-bedroom house on Rangely Avenue in West Hollywood together. The relationship quickly deteriorated because of Sweeney's possessiveness and jealousy. The couple fought frequently and Sweeney began physically abusing Dunne. According to one account, he yanked handfuls of her hair out by the roots during an argument on August 27, 1982. She fled to her mother's house where Sweeney showed up and began to bang on the door and windows, demanding to be let in. Dunne's mother told him to leave and threatened to call the police. A few days later, Dunne returned to their home and continued their relationship. During another argument at their home on September 26, 1982, Sweeney grabbed Dunne by the throat, threw her on the floor, and began to strangle her. A friend who was staying with the couple heard [...] "loud gagging sounds" [...] and ran into the room where Dunne was being attacked. Dunne told the friend that Sweeney had tried to kill her, but Sweeney denied the claim and told Dunne to come back to bed. She pretended to comply, but sneaked out of the bathroom window instead. When Sweeney heard Dunne start the engine of her car, he ran out and jumped on the car's <b>hood.</b> Dunne <b>stopped</b> the car long enough for Sweeney to jump off the hood and then drove away. For the next few days, she stayed with her mother and at the homes of her friends. She later called Sweeney and ended the relationship. After he moved out, she had the locks changed and moved back into the Rangely Avenue home.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the GT-Four (or {{previously}} {{known as}} All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets. This ST205 version {{was to be}} the most powerful Celica produced to date, producing [...] (export version) or [...] (Japanese market) from an updated 3S-GTE engine. Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory team in the World Rally Championship, {{the final version of the}} GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the Intercooler's front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation protection, a hood spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to <b>stop</b> <b>hood</b> flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car's single victory due to turbocharger fixing - a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake - when the jubilee clip was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix - but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.|$|R
