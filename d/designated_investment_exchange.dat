40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} exchange rate movements on investment decisions of firms in an oligopolistic market. In a two-country-world model, {{we focus on the}} capacity investment decisions of small (small initial capacity and high marginal cost) and large (large initial capacity and low marginal cost) domestic firms. Both type of firms use foreign inputs in production and sell their output in the foreign market, thus they are prone to changes in exchange rate from both cost and demand side. Results show that devaluations alter the composition of production and the relative share of small and inefficient firms at the expense of large and efficient firms in the economy.

40|$|The study {{examined}} manufacturing performance for sustainable {{economic development in}} Nigeria, while the specific objectives are as follows: i) {{to look at the}} growth rate and contribution of manufacturing to GDP. ii) to examine trend in both manufacturing and employment. iii) to determine the structure of capacity utilization. iv) to determine factors influencing manufacturing performance. Panel data analysis was used on secondary data from 1980 - 2008 that was extracted from CBN Statistical Bulletin. The results indicate positive relationship between manufacturing and each of capacity utilization and import as 1 percent change in capacity utilization and import lead to 43081 and 3. 8 percent change in manufacturing respectively. However, there is a negative relationship between manufacturing and each of <b>investment,</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, and export. A 1 percent change in <b>investment,</b> <b>exchange</b> rate and export lead to 0. 04, 12729, 0. 3 percent reduction in manufacturing respectively. The t-values for investment, capacity utilization and import were used to test the hypothesis that each coefficient is different from 0. This is rejected; since the t-value are lower than 1. 96 (at 95 % confidence level). This showed that investment, capacity utilization and import were major determinants of manufacturing performance for the period. The study concludes that the key to reversing the poor performance of Nigerian manufacturing is to provide incentives for firms to become more export oriented...|$|R

We present a model yielding testable implications on the long-run co-movements of real exchange rates, external positions, relative GDP and terms of trade, and cross-country and time-series evidence on the subject. Countries with net external liabilities are found to have more depreciated real exchange rates, with the main channel of transmission working through the relative price of nontraded goods.

40|$|To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} paper to examine the informational {{efficiency}} of the equity market as compared to the syndicated bank loan market. The loan market is a private market comprised of financial institutions with access to private information. We test whether this is reflected in informationally efficient price formation in the loan market vis a vis the equity markets, and reject this private information hypothesis. We find support for a liquidity hypothesis, suggesting that equity markets lead loan markets, despite bank lenders’ access to private information, because of greater liquidity in equity markets. Only when equity markets are relatively illiquid do we find evidence supporting the private information hypothesis. Finally, we find evidence of abnormal returns if portfolios are constructed using lagged equity returns to <b>designate</b> <b>investments</b> in the syndicated bank loan market. ...|$|R
