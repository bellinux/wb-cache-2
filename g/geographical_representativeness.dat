Under this framework, some guidelines have been developed to address the DQRs. For instance, in the ILCD Handbook (European Commission JRC and Sustainability 2010 c), data quality scores rank the datasets based on six indicators (technological representativeness, <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness,</b> time-related representativeness, completeness, precision/uncertainty, and methodological appropriateness and consistency) with data quality scores of 1 to 5 (high to low) assigned to each.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} areas of potential improvement of the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) electricity datasets. The revision is based on the data quality indicators described by the International Life Cycle Data system (ILCD) Handbook, applied on sectorial basis.

Results show that ELCD electricity datasets have a very good quality in general terms, nevertheless some findings and recommendations in order to improve the quality of Life-Cycle Inventories have been derived. Moreover, these results ensure the quality of the electricity-related datasets to any LCA practitioner, and provide insights related to the limitations and assumptions underlying in the datasets modelling. Giving this information, the LCA practitioner will be able to decide whether the use of the ELCD electricity datasets is appropriate based on the goal and scope of the analysis to be conducted. The methodological approach would be also useful for dataset developers and reviewers, in order to improve the overall Data Quality Requirements of databases.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{claimed that the}} {{participation}} of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) can mitigate the democratic deficit of the European Union. This claim rests {{on the assumption that}} civil society organizations channel citizens concerns to the European institutions, a view which is also shared by the European Commission. But whom do Brussels-based CSOs actually represent? Some have accused Brussels CSOs of being elitist and detached from their membership bases, but not much evidence has been provided by either these critics or by the CSO sympathizers. This paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap by exploring the <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness</b> of EU CSOs {{and the extent to which}} they involve their members in organizational activities and decision-making. CSOs in European Trade Policy (ETP) and in European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) serve as case studies. It is assumed that the different political opportunity structures in these policy fields, namely the Commissions demand for <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness</b> and member representation in ETP and the Councils interest in CSOs knowledge and expertise in ESDP, are also reflected in the organizational structures of CSOs. The results confirm this hypothesis with regard to the geographical outreach of the organizations interviewed, but not with regard to the ways CSOs involve their members. CSOs in External Trade Policy have member organizations in a large number of European countries while many CSOs in ESDP lack a membership base. However, the member-based organizations of both policy fields involve their members in strategic decision-making and in diverse organizational activities and they communicate frequently with them. Evidence for a detachment of CSO secretariats in Brussels from their membership bases is scarce in the CSOs subject to this study...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{availability}} of data measuring noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor indicators from household surveys conducted in India from 2000 to 2009. METHODS: Questionnaires and publications used in household surveys were identified through internet and PubMed searches and examined to determine which core NCD risk factor indicators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for NCD monitoring were being measured. Surveys with a sample size of 5000 or more were included to ensure {{a certain level of}} precision. The completeness of core indicator measurement and the <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness</b> of the surveys were assessed. FINDINGS: Twenty six surveys met the inclusion criteria. Among the WHO-recommended core behavioural risk factor indicators, those monitoring tobacco use were measured completely in national and subnational surveys; those assessing dietary intake and physical inactivity were measured only in subnational surveys, and those assessing alcohol use were not measured at all. Among WHO-recommended core biological risk factors, only body mass index was measured in national and subnational surveys, whereas blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and blood cholesterol were measured only in subnational surveys. Due to the use of non-standard indicator definitions, measurement of core indicators in some of the national and subnational surveys was incomplete. CONCLUSION: The availability of data on core risk factor indicators to monitor the increasing burden of NCDs is inadequate in India. These indicators using standardized definitions {{should be included in the}} periodic national household health surveys to provide data at the national and disaggregated levels. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|While {{greening}} agriculture {{has emerged}} as a new paradigm in agricultural research and development, one of the UNEP’s findings is that transitions of agricultural systems away from “Business-as-usual” are required if negative externalities of agriculture are to be reduced. To make these transitions effective, actors collectively {{need to be able to}} anticipate the future so that planning can be implemented and steps taken for action. As decision support tools, foresight studies can help build this representation of the future and identify possible avenues to meet the desired ones. We have implemented a foresight study on agriculture in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). We adopted a participatory approach and a scenario based methodology. Fifteen experts were chosen on the basis of their diversity of disciplinary and professional backgrounds, their knowledge of, and implication in the territory, as well as for their <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness.</b> Additionally, two non-Guadeloupian experts were selected as outsiders both from a geographic and a conceptual point of view in order to help us broaden our thinking horizons. Several workshops, of which two have already been held, are planned with this group of experts. Steps of the methodology include: 1 /building up a common representation of the system at stake; 2 /identifying the past tendencies of the variables that define and influence the system; 3 /inferring hypotheses on their future evolution and 4 / building up the “Futuribles” (i. e. the possible scenarios for the future of the system). The scope of the foresight study is the year 2040. Such a pace of time allows taking breaks into account in the analysis of past tendencies and liberating the discourse of participants. Among the first findings are the fact that agriculture in Guadeloupe needs to be re-defined to better take into account small holders into agricultural policies, and that adequate mechanisms needs to be identified to help both agricultures (conventional mainstream agriculture and small scale agriculture) meet an evolving demand while being sustainable...|$|E
40|$|AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To provide model-based {{estimates}} of all cancers patient survival in Italy and in Italian large geographical areas (North-West, North-East, Center, South), where only partial coverage of cancer registries data is available, and to describe {{them in terms}} of time trends. Moreover, to measure the degree of representativeness of cancer patient survival obtained from Italian cancer registries data. METHODS: Relative survival in the four main Italian geographical areas was estimated by a parametric mixture model belonging to the class of "cure" survival models. Data used are from Italian cancer registries, stratified by sex, period of diagnosis and age. The Italian national survival was obtained as a weighted average of these area-specific estimates, with weights proportional to the number of estimated incident cases in every area. The model takes into account also differences in survival temporal trends between the areas. RESULTS: Relative survival for all cancers combined in Italian patients diagnosed in 1990 - 1994 was estimated to be higher in women (53 %) than in men (38 %) at 5 years from the diagnosis. The survival trend is increasing by period and decreasing by age, both for men and women. The greatest gain in terms of survival was obtained by the elderly, with annual mean growth rates in the period 1978 - 1994 equal to 3. 5 % and 3. 2 % for men and women, respectively. More than 50 % of the youngest cancer patients were "cured", whereas for the elderly this proportion dropped to 15 % and 25 % for men and women, respectively. The South of Italy had the lowest survival and the North the most pronounced increase. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained national survival estimates are similar, but not identical, to previously published estimates, in which Italian registries' data were pooled without any adjustment for <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness.</b> The four Italian areas have different survival levels and trends, showing variability within the country. The differences in survival between men and women may be explained by the different proportion of lethal cancers.

40|$|Background In 2011, local {{authority}} Directors of Public Health were designated {{as one of}} the responsible authorities for all alcohol licensing decisions in England. Since there is no explicit licensing objective around health, any representations need {{to be based on the}} existing objectives oriented around public safety, prevention of nuisance, child protection, and crime prevention. We aimed to appraise the benefits of an analytical support package developed by Public Health England in facilitating the use of health-related information in local licensing decisions and the prospects for a dedicated health-related licensing objective. Methods A case-study methodology was used to invite nine {{local authority}} pilot areas to participate (one declined) on the basis of broad <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness</b> across English regions and qualifying criteria that included a dedicated public health lead for alcohol licensing. Each participant was provided with an analytical support package consisting of a compendium of health-relevant data, local mapping software, and guidance on setting up data-sharing agreements. Key informants, including those in public health and licensing, were interviewed at baseline and after 8 – 12 weeks. Three mock licensing hearings, in which hypothetical licence applications involving health-related evidence were assessed by a panel, were conducted during the intervention phase. Follow-up focus group interviews involved a total of 31 informants across seven sites. A quantitative assessment of licensing activity was derived from Home Office statistics. Findings Perceived difficulty in proving that a new licence would have a damaging impact on health had the effect of discouraging objections from public health teams. Obtaining timely access to localised health information was often problematic. There was also a degree of mismatch between the predominantly data-oriented approach by public health teams and the need for contextualised evidence for presentation to councillors. Early findings, however, demonstrated that several local authority areas were able to overcome these issues by incorporating novel indicators of health harm and using the mapping tools as a way of engaging their licensing committee. Interpretation Constraints around the more effective use of health information in the alcohol licensing process are not restricted to the presence or absence of a dedicated health-related licensing objective. Although such an objective might enhance the legitimacy of a role for public health, more streamlined access to localised health information, stronger collaborative working with other responsible authorities, and training in how to contextualise evidence will be crucial to improving local alcohol harm reduction through licensing...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{represent a}} huge investment {{in terms of}} materials and energy and they lead to significant environmental impacts. Thus, {{there is a need}} to choose the most sustainable and eco-friendly alternative. From this perspective, this report aims to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the construction of two fictitious structures: a bridge and a tunnel. To fully assess and fairly compare the environmental burdens of those two structures, the life cycle assessment (LCA) has been chosen. Prior to the case studies, the LCA process is described and a literature review related to LCAs of road structures is performed thus revealing the key facts and key figures of such studies. Based on this literature review, a simplified LCA is performed; it relies on public databases and only takes into account the construction phase. Because of data constraints, the indicators that are considered are NOx, SO 2  and CO 2 emissions, and the categories that are taken into account are energy consumption, global warming potential and photochemical oxidant formation. Characterization factors come from the REciPE method. Three different stages are considered and compared during this LCA study; the production of materials, the construction processes and the transportation phase. Results show that the environmental impacts of the bridge are higher than the ones of the tunnel and that the amount of concrete has a strong influence on the final results and consequently on the interpretation phase. This study also emphasizes the importance of assumptions and describes their potential influence on the final results by considering two different alternatives related to the concrete’s manufacturing. Making the concrete directly on site instead of bringing it by truck significantly decreases the environmental impacts of both structures; indeed, for the bridge structure, it leads to a diminution in CO 2 emissions, global warming potential and energy consumption by more than 60 %. The main constraint of this study has been the data collection for the life cycle inventory; indeed, many data were missing or coming from different public databases which result in a lack of thoroughness and precision (e. g. different <b>geographical</b> <b>representativeness).</b> Results of this study strongly depend on the various assumptions and on the data that have been collected, and technical choices, methodologies of construction or structural design mainly depend on the project’s location; consequently, results and conclusions cannot be generalized and should be handled carefully...|$|E

The other databases that have been analysed are the following: 	Ecoinvent database([URL] 	E 3 database ([URL] 	GEMIS database ([URL] The main criteria for the database selection were based on the availability of EU-related data, the inclusion of wide datasets on energy products and services (specially focusing on those matching the chosen energy patterns), and the broad approval by the scientific community. Up to 24 energy datasets were selected for the analysis with the criteria of selecting a sufficiently representative sample of energy sources in the European context. The evaluation has been based on the quality indicators developed within the ILCD handbook (EC-JRC-IES 2010 a, 2010 b, 2011) : Technological representativeness, <b>Geographical</b> <b>representativeness,</b> Time-related representativeness, Completeness, Precision / Uncertainty, and Methodological appropriateness and consistency.
