2500|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. [...] He anchored off {{the west coast of}} the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew was initially welcomed and treated with honor. He and his men were given much food, various gifts from the islands inhabitants. They were shown traditional native performances and ceremonies, and generally treated as privileged guests, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity Lono. However, after he and the crews of both ships, [...] and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only american aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only citizen aboard the ship not loyal to the crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed, neutral account of the events in his journals [...] During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter and forcibly stole the wood used to border the natives sacred [...] "Morai" [...] burial ground, used for high ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals, Cook offered two iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "The poor dismayed chief's dreading his (Cook's) displeasure, which they saw approaching followed him upon the Morai to behold the fence that enclosed the mansions of their noble ancestors, and the images of their gods torn to pieces by a handful of rude strangers without the power, or at least without the resolution of opposing their sacrilegious depredations. When Cook had ascended the Morai he once more offered the hatchets to the chiefs. It was a very unequal price if the honest chiefs would have accepted of the bribe and Cook offered it only to evade the imputation of taking their property without payment." [...] [...] John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain friend of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. John Ledyard goes on to say in his journal: [...] "On the evening of the (January) 15th we struck our tents, and everything was taken on board, and it was very manifestly much to the satisfaction of the natives. A little after dark an old house that stood {{on the corner of the}} Morai took fire and burned down. This we supposed was occasioned by our people carelessly leaving their fire near it, but it was not the case. The natives burnt it themselves to show us the resentment they now entertained towards us, on account of our using it without their consent, and indeed manifestly against their consent. We had made a sail loft of one part of it, and a hospital for our sick for the other part, though it was evidently esteemed by the natives as holy as the rest of the Morai, and ought to have been considered by us." [...] On the 6th of February Cook's ships unmoored and left Kealakekua bay. They were met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On February 11th, the Resolution again entered Kealakekua bay on the night of 13 February. [...] Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance.....It was also equally evident <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>looks</b> <b>of</b> the natives as well as every other appearance that our friendship was at an end, and that we had nothing to do but to hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of being wondered at..." [...] While anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of only two long boats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to force good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii,Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of mistakes. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians mistaking the explorer for their own deity.|$|E
