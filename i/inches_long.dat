Identification Tips: It is easily recognized by its diffuse growthhabit, its short and broad, rather distant, usually red-margined leaflets, and its tiny, whitish, lavender-striate flowers.

5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong, somewhat wedge-shaped, equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The mid-rib is usually folded longitudinally, and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> (2.5 to 5.1cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their most attractive {{in the month of}} January. It typically grows to 45 – 50cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000ft. (914 m). Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two <b>inches</b> <b>long,</b> were on his cheeks. The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon or hand-gun is {{a bronze}} hand cannon {{manufactured}} {{no later than}} 1288 and is possibly the world's oldest confirmed surviving firearm. It weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds) and is 34 centimeters (13.4 <b>inches)</b> <b>long.</b> The Heilongjiang hand cannon was excavated during the 1970s in Banlachengzi, a village in Acheng District, Heilongjiang province, China. It was found alongside other bronze artifacts made {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin Dynasty (12th–13th century). The hand cannon was probably used in battles fought nearby Banlachengzi in 1287 and 1288. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led a group of soldiers equipped with hand cannons into a military camp in 1288, as part of an anti-rebellion campaign for the Yuan dynasty. The cannon currently resides at the Heilongjiang Provincial Museum in Harbin, China.|$|E
40|$|Glabrous annual 2 to {{12 inches}} tall. Ligules 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 <b>inch</b> <b>long,</b> {{slightly}} puberulent, entire. Blades < 1 / 16 inch broad, involute, to 1 <b>inch</b> <b>long.</b> Spike usually {{about half the}} height of the plant. Spikelets 1 / 8 to <b>inch</b> <b>long</b> (exclusive of the awn). Glumes usually reddish (purplish) -tinged, exceeding the lemma. Callus of the floret short-bearded. Lemma with a straight awn 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 <b>inch</b> <b>long</b> from a shortly bifid apex. Identification Tips: This taxon can be distinguished from all other grasses by its small size, reddish or purplish-tinged color, unbranched inflorescence with spikelets sunken into opposite sides of the stem. It is also the only member of its genus that occurs in our area. Phenology: Blooms April through May...|$|R

5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E
