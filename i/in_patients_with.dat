5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> HRS remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
