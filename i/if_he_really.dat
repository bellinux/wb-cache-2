5|$|The {{documentation}} of the various phrases of the construction {{makes no mention of}} anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, {{but it is not clear}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> had the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio.|$|E

On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth.

500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] debuted to {{mixed and}} {{positive}} reviews among critics.

On a more thorough review, Idolator's Carl Williott found the production [...] "dynamic" [...] comparing it to compositions by Lana Del Rey and while [...] "the pre-chorus could be from a 60's girl group", the [...] "percussion and electro flitting in the background" [...] is what makes pop music nowadays. He concluded, that it's [...] "a flipside" [...] to Mars' lead single.. HitFix's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B- rating, praising the melody and Mars' vocal delivery, writing [...] "he makes it all sound so sweet, and as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is tortured by these young girls", but ultimately calling the lyrics [...] "a little skeevy". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, while reviewing the album, believed that it [...] "swells something serious. The ambition is undeniable". He compared it {{to the music of}} U2 and Daughtry.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't you be so hard on me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Sharon {{begins a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick's other brother, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), and becomes pregnant with his child. However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to be with}} her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan to go through what he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy" [...] lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, [...] "broodier and more revealing". The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is [...] "a reflective look back at the decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need to know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E
