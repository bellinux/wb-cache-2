50|$|When Touch-Tone {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, the <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> signaling (DTMF) tone generator also required correct polarity as it depended on the line D.C. voltage for operation.

However, some special circuits, such as some direct inward dialing (DID) trunks, T-1 lines, and ground start lines connected to field side (terminal) equipment, e.g., a corporate private branch exchange (PBX) switch, correctly operate only with proper tip and ring polarity.|$|R

50|$|It was {{recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1940s that faster, more accurate dialing could be done with push buttons, but this was too unreliable in customer trials until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public its <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used push-button telephones. In the decades after 1963, pulse dialing was gradually phased out as the primary dialing method to the central office, but many systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch for the selection of tone or pulse dialing.|$|R
50|$|When dialing from a {{land-line}} telephone, {{the telephone}} number is encoded and transmitted across the telephone line {{in form of}} <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> signaling (DTMF). The tones control the telephone system by instructing the telephone switch where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same channel, the copper wire, and in the frequency range (300 Hz to 3.4 kHz) as the audio of the telephone call. In-band signaling is also used on older telephone carrier systems to provide inter-exchange information for routing calls. Examples {{of this kind of}} in-band signaling system are the Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) and R2 signalling.|$|R

50|$|Multi-frequency {{signaling}} (MF) is a {{group of}} signaling methods that use a mixture of two pure tone (pure sine wave) sounds. Various MF signaling protocols were devised by the Bell System and CCITT. The earliest of these were for in-band signaling between switching centers, where long-distance telephone operators used a 16-digit keypad to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance telephone calls, <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.|$|R
50|$|Western Electric experimented {{as early}} as 1941 with methods of using {{mechanically}} activated reeds to produce two tones {{for each of the}} ten digits and by the late 1940s such technology was field-tested in a No. 5 Crossbar switching system in Pennsylvania. But the technology proved unreliable and it was not until long after the invention of the transistor when push-button technology matured. On 18 November 1963, after approximately three years of customer testing, the Bell System in the United States officially introduced <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> (DTMF) technology under its registered Touch-Tone mark. Over the next few decades touch-tone service replaced traditional pulse dialing technology and it eventually became a world-wide standard for telecommunication signaling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) {{recommendations}} for <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> (DTMF) signaling are not met by conventional DTMF detectors. We present an efficient DTMF detection algorithm {{based on the}} non-uniform discrete Fourier transform that meets all of the ITU recommendations. The key innovations are the use of two sliding windows and development of sophisticated timing tests. Our algorithm requires no buffering of input samples. To perform DTMF detection on n telephone channels, our algorithm requires approximately n MIPS on a digital signal processor (DSP), 120 + 30 n words of data memory, and 1000 words of program memory. Using the new algorithm, a single fixed-point DSP can perform ITU-compliant DTMF detection on the 24 telephone channels of a T 1 time-division multiplexed telecommunications line...|$|R
50|$|The touch tone key pad has sixteen keys {{laid out}} in a four-by-four matrix. Each key {{produces}} a combination of two audible tone frequencies, determined by their position on the pad. Each column and row has a distinct frequency assigned, thus generating a total of sixteen <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> (DTMF) signals. Early keypads only used the keys with the digits 1 through 9 and 0. The extra keys were intended for computer data entry, business functions, and military applications. By 1967, the keys with the asterisk (*) and hash (#) were added on all subscriber telephone sets. The keys A, B, C, D were used as priority signals (FO, F, I, and P) in the Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) of the US military.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} landline telephone system, {{also known}} as {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS), commonly carries both control and audio signals on the same twisted pair (C in diagram) of insulated wires, the telephone line. The control and signaling equipment consists of three components, the ringer, the hookswitch, and a dial. The ringer, or beeper, light or other device (A7), alerts the user to incoming calls. The hookswitch signals to the central office that the user has picked up the handset to either answer a call or initiate a call. A dial, if present, is used by the subscriber to transmit a telephone number to the central office when initiating a call. Until the 1960s dials used almost exclusively the rotary technology, which was replaced by <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> signaling (DTMF) with pushbutton telephones (A4).|$|R
40|$|For {{increased}} bandwidth {{savings in}} packet networks, speech compression algorithms {{are applied to}} reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred to adequately reconstruct a telephone signal at the receiver. However, such algorithms do not process pure tones (such as <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> (DTMF)) with high fidelity, hence such in-band signalling tones must be detected before packetization occurs. To minimise the amount of DTMF tone distortion, and detect valid tones which may contain impairments, the tone recognition algorithm needs to decode tone-pairs in as short a time as possible. Many existing systems already use the Goertzel algorithm for DTMF tone detection. This paper presents a modification to the algorithm which allows an effective increase in detection frequency by overlapping, without the need for reprocessing of input data...|$|R
