"Now toils the hero; {{trees on}} trees o'erthrown [...] Fall {{crackling}} round, and the forests groan; [...] Sudden, full twenty {{on the plain}} are strewed, [...] And lopped and lightened of their branchy load. [...] At equal angles these disposed to join, [...] He smoothed and squared them by the rule and line. [...] (The wimbles for the work Calypso found), [...] With those he pierced them and with clinchers bound. [...] Long and capacious as a shipwright forms [...] Some bark's broad bottom to outride the storms, [...] So large he built the raft; then ribbed it strong [...] From space to space, and nailed the planks along. [...] These formed the sides; the deck he fashioned last; [...] Then o'er the vessel raised the taper mast, [...] With crossing sail-yards dancing in the wind: [...] And to the helm the <b>guiding</b> <b>rudder</b> joined [...] (With yielding osiers fenced to break the force [...] Of surging waves, and steer the steady course). [...] Thy loom, Calypso, for the future sails [...] Supplied the cloth, capacious of the gales. [...] With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship, [...] And, rolled on levers, launched her on the deep." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{route from}} Rotorua to Taupo for early European travellers passed right through Orakei Korako, {{and it was}} the existing Māori who provided a dugout canoe for the river crossings. It was {{at this point in the}} early 20th century that the geothermal area was established as a visitor attraction. To transfer visitors across the then-swift Waikato River they used the dugout canoe, until in the 1930s a wire-strop and pulley system was erected across the river, and a punt with a <b>guiding</b> <b>rudder</b> was used to catch the flow and propel the punt to the other side. The tourist resort was officially opened on 15 December 1937.|$|E
5000|$|A minor source which Shakespeare {{certainly}} {{used was}} Arthur Brooke's The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet (1562), {{which was also}} Shakespeare's source for Romeo and Juliet. Much of Margaret's speech to her army in Act 5, Scene 4 is taken almost verbatim from Brooke. In Romeus and Juliet, Friar Laurence advises Romeus {{to stand up to}} his troubles, and be brave in the face of great danger;::A wise man in the midst of troubles and distressStill stands not wailing present harm, but seeks his harm's redress.As when the winter flaws with dreadful noise arise,And heave the foamy swelling waves up to the starry skies,So that the bruis'd barque in cruel seas betost,Despaireth of the happy haven, in danger to be lost.The pilot bold at helm, cries, 'Mates, strike now your sail',And turns her stem into the waves that strongly her assail.Then driven hard upon the bare and wreckful shore,In greater danger to be wrecked than he had been before,He seeth his ship full right against the rock to run,But yet he doth what lieth in him the perilous rock to shun.Sometimes the beaten boat, by cunning government -The anchors lost, the cables broke, and all the tackle spent,The rudder smitten off, and overboad the |mast -Doth win the long desir'd port, the stormy danger past.But if the master dread, and overpressed with woe,Begin to wring his hands, and lets the <b>guiding</b> <b>rudder</b> go,The ship rents on the rock or sinketh in the deep,And eke the coward drench'd is: So, if thou still beweepAnd seek not how to help the changes that do chance,Thy cause of sorrow shall increase, thou cause of thy mischance.(ll.1359-1380)This is very similar to Margaret's speech in 3 Henry VI; ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn December 2008 {{the remains}} of a wooden ship was {{discovered}} in Puerto Madero, down town in Buenos Aires. At preliminary observations, it would be a Spanish merchant ship from XVIII century. During the dig, remains from ship and loading were found. Among different kind of things, a sternpost gudgeon was found separated from the rest. This element has an important structural function in the ship associated with the support and <b>guide</b> of the <b>rudder.</b> The objective of the present paper is to analyze the geometric, structural and metallurgic characteristics from the mentioned artifact obtained at the archaeological site Zencity, to get a best understanding about the technology used to manufacture it, and a best knowledge of the complete finding. To this purpose, several analytical techniques were performed. First of all a visual and dimensional analysis was done on the piece. Then material was characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy and chemical composition was determined by energy dispersive X ray spectrometry (EDS). Also microhardness was measured and non metallic inclusions were analyzed. According to results the piece would have been made of forged ferrous alloy with a significant complexity in its manufacturing. It presents forge welded areas with large slag inclusions. Ferritic-pearlitic structures differentiated according to the area were detected with different grain sizes, which would indicate heterogeneous temperature of hot working. Some Adjacent areas that show different contents of carbon were identified indicating the use of different materials, especially to form parts of larger thickness...|$|R
5000|$|In all {{of these}} Polyphemus is somewhere in the background, but many others feature Galatea alone, as in Perino del Vaga's {{painting}} of her being drawn by sea beasts over the waves while riding on a seashell. Generally, though, the nymph is carried through the sea by adoring attendants in paintings generally titled [...] "The Triumph of Galatea", of which the most renowned treatment is by Raphael. In general these follow the 3rd-century description given of such a painting by Philostratus the Younger in his Imagines: The nymph sports on the peaceful sea, driving a team of four dolphins yoked together and working in harmony; and maiden-daughters of Triton, Galatea’s servants, guide them, curving them in {{if they try to}} do anything mischievous or contrary to the rein. She holds over her heads against the wind a light scarf of sea-purple to provide a shade for herself and a sail for her chariot, and from it a kind of radiance falls upon her forehead and her head, though no white more charming than the bloom on her cheek; her hair is not tossed by the breeze, for it is so moist that it is proof against the wind. And lo, her right elbow stands out and her white forearm is bent back, while she rests her fingers on her delicate shoulder, and her arms are gently rounded, and her breasts project, nor yet is beauty lacking in her thigh. Her foot, with the graceful part that ends in it, is painted as on the sea and it lightly touches the water {{as if it were the}} <b>rudder</b> <b>guiding</b> her chariot. Her eyes are wonderful, for they have a kind of distant look that travels as far as the sea extends. In those cases where the rejected lover Polyphemus appears somewhere ashore, the division between them is emphasised by their being identified with their respective elements, sea and land. Typical examples of this were painted by Francois Perrier, Giovanni Lanfranco and Jean-Baptiste van Loo.|$|R
