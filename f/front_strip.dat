30|$|Two iTLC-SG strips, each 2 - 2.5 cm {{wide and}} 10 cm long, were {{marked with a}} pencil at 1.5 cm {{from the bottom of}} the strip (“start”) and a second line at 8.5 cm {{indicating}} the solvent front (“front”). The strips were dried at 100 °C for 1 hour and stored in a desiccator with silica gel. The conditioned strips were removed from the desiccator only prior to use (max. 30 minutes). For the chromatography strip one, a solvent mixture of 6 ml ethyl actetate and 4 ml methyl ethyl ketone (EtAc/MEK, 60 : 40) was prepared and transferred to the chromatography tank. For strip two, 9 ml of ethanol and 1 ml of distilled water (ETOH/H 2 O, ratio 90 : 10) were prepared the same way. The tanks were left to equilibrate for 10 - 15 minutes. A QC sample aliquot was applied on each strip and strips were developed in the corresponding tanks in parallel, until the solvent <b>front.</b> <b>Strip</b> 1 takes about 5 minutes to develop, strip 2 about 15 minutes.
