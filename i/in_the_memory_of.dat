5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E

5|$|The tragedy {{became part}} of the Albanian folk song {{repertoire}} relating to the migration of Albanians abroad. The leading figures of this practice were local intellectuals called rapsods related the mythistory of kurbet before World War II with the migration. They make use of metaphors and performance devices taken from oral folk poetry and death laments which react on the migrations to fix them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the community.

5|$|The Bothell Road {{became part}} of the Pacific Highway in 1915, which would {{continue}} north from Bothell towards Everett. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> World War I veterans. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new national highway system that was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials on November 11, 1926, and numbered as US99. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.|$|E
5|$|The Burnside Fountain is a non-functioning {{drinking}} fountain at {{the southeast corner}} of Worcester Common in Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists of two parts, a pink granite basin, and a bronze statue of a young boy riding a sea turtle. The basin was designed by architect Henry Bacon, who later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., and the figure was created by sculptor Charles Y. Harvey. Harvey committed suicide before finishing the sculpture, and Sherry Fry completed the bronze. The Burnside Fountain was commissioned in 1905 by the city of Worcester after Harriet F. Burnside bequeathed US $5,000 to create a fountain to provide fresh water for people, horses and dogs, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> her father, a prominent lawyer. The fountain was installed in 1912 in Central Square, then moved in 1969 to its current location on Worcester Common. In 1970 the statue was stolen, and was re-installed two years later. An attempted theft occurred in 2004.|$|E
