5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} was formulated in the 1930s by British economist Dennis Robertson and Swedish economist Bertil Ohlin.

5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> {{is capable of}} undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of insoluble silver chloride.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In the Gospel of Luke {{the words}} of the Magnificat are spoken by Mary when she visits her cousin Elizabeth, both being pregnant, Mary with Jesus and Elisabeth with John the Baptist. In Christianity, the feast commemorating that visit is called Visitation.

5|$|Kathak, a {{classical}} dance form, owes <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> {{to the state}} of Uttar Pradesh. The dance form is connected to classical Hindustani music where the rhythmic nimbleness of the feet is accompanied by either Tabla or Pakhawaj. Four of the six schools of this dance form, Lucknow gharana, Ajrara gharana, Farukhabad gharana and Benares gharana, are situated in Uttar Pradesh.|$|E

The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing muscle in monkeys and apes where it has <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> in the tendinous region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E
5|$|Protestantism is {{the largest}} Christian {{religious}} grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention {{is the largest}} individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland, It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics with 40 percent of the total population. Lutheranism in the U.S. has <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North and South Dakota are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion {{of the majority of the}} population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|The border {{position}} of Transylvania {{led to the}} formation of the voivodeship, since the monarchs could not maintain direct control over this remote region. Thus the voivodes were never autonomous, but remained provincial officials. The voivodes were heads of Fehér County from 1201, which may indicate that their position had <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> in the office of that county's ispán.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the {{earthquake}} swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and <b>its</b> <b>origin</b> in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives in August and September.|$|E

The school was moved to Reykjavík in 1786, but poor housing conditions forced it to move again in 1805 to Bessastaðir near Reykjavík. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík.|$|E
