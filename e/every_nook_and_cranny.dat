500|$|Many of D'Angelo's peers {{have noted}} {{the success of the}} [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video as a {{contributing}} factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work, as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour. A columnist for SoulBounce.com has cited the video as the [...] "jump-the-shark moment" [...] for D'Angelo, and stated [...] "It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it, least of all him".

500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into <b>every</b> <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the character, {{in a way you}} don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|... …Significant too is {{that from}} the early 1800s the Finnish seamen sailing these ships had journeyed {{up and down the}} North and South American coasts.

60|$|We {{drank the}} soup, {{but we did}} not eat the bread. Not that we were not hungry, and not that the bread was uneatable. It was fairly good bread. But we had reasons. My cell-mate had {{discovered}} that our cell was alive with bed-bugs. In all the cracks and interstices between the bricks where the mortar had fallen out flourished great colonies. The natives even ventured out in the broad daylight and swarmed over the walls and ceiling by hundreds. My cell-mate was wise in the ways of the beasts. Like Childe Roland, dauntless the slug-horn to his lips he bore. Never was there such a battle. It lasted for hours. It was shambles. And when the last survivors fled to their brick-and-mortar fastnesses, our work was only half done. We chewed mouthfuls of our bread until it was reduced to the consistency of putty. When a fleeing belligerent escaped into a crevice between the bricks, we promptly walled him in with a daub of the chewed bread. We toiled on until the light grew dim <b>and</b> until <b>every</b> hole, <b>nook,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> was closed. I shudder to think of the tragedies of starvation and cannibalism that must have ensued behind those bread-plastered ramparts.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{looks into}} the problem of public education funding in Nigeria. Immediately after independence, great strides {{were made in the}} area of mass education. The government’s efforts towards education recorded huge successes across the country. This period witnessed the establishment of great number of educational institutions, to complement what the country inherited from the pre - independent (colonial) administration. The major universities within the country today were established during that period, which introduced academic programmes that were relevant in preparing the foundation for growth and development of a newly independent nation. The attention towards education lasted for a period of time, before reversal of fortunes setin. The downturn could be traced firstly to the civil war that engulfed the newly independent nation just seven years after self rule, which created distrust among the various ethnic groups. The incursion of the military into government could be another reason for the neglect of the public educational institutions. The military at that moment was preoccupied with keeping the country together, rather than focusing on the provision of education and other social services. The lack of proper attention towards the education sector cuts across the different levels - from primary to tertiary. These two factors coupled with the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) led to the collapse of the education sector of the country. With the collapse of public schools, the need for private schools became necessary and agitation for the approval of private schools started in earnest. Selection process into private schools are centered firstly on financial ability before other factors like academic ability are considered (a common practice {{in most parts of the}} globe), because they are first and foremost commercial ventures. With the level of poverty in Nigeria astronomically high, approximately 80 % of the population relied on public schools for their educational needs as a result of the subsidized cost. The trend seems to have changed greatly, with a near total collapse of standard in public schools as a 3 result of government neglect over time. While at the same time, the private educational institutions have continued to spring up at <b>every</b> <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> in the country. This thesis is going look into how the above scenario is going to affect the achievement of the MDG goal 2, and also how the deterioration of public education in Nigeria is going to affect the quality of life of the majority of the populace that depends on it for their intellectual needs...|$|R
