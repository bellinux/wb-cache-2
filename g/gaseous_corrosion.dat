40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chromium}} {{additions to the}} weldability of Fe-Al based overlay claddings are currently being investigated for the corrosion protection of boiler tubes in Low NOx furnaces. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to identify weldable (crack-free) Fe-Al-Cr weld overlay coating compositions that provide corrosion resistance over long exposure times. During the current project phase, preliminary corrosion testing was conducted on several ternary Fe-Al-Cr alloys in two types of <b>gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> environments. These long-term corrosion tests were used to develop a target weld composition matrix and serve as a base line for future corrosion tests. Preliminary Fe-Al based welds with various aluminum concentrations and one ternary Fe-Al-Cr weld overlay were successfully deposited using a Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process and cracking susceptibility was evaluated on these coatings...|$|E
40|$|A coating {{obtained}} by flame spraying (Ni-Al) and an aluminizing type (Sermaloy J) {{were tested in}} laboratory and in industrial waste incinerator (substrate : AISI 310 S steel). In laboratory tests, the studied parameters were : HCl-content (1 and 3 % vol. in air + 0. 1 % vol. SO 2), temperature (600 and 800 °C) and thermal cycling between 800 and 400 °C. The increasing of the temperature and HCl-content, and also thermal cycling lead to a degradation of the non coated steel and Ni-Al coated specimen behaviours; as for Sermaloy J, only temperature raising {{seems to have a}} detrimental effect (first batch). For the field tests, the specimens were exposed at about 600 °C in flue gases containing about 0. 4 % vol. HCl and flying ashes (sodium chloride and sulfate); the corrosion phenomena are more closed to molten salts interactions than to <b>gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> : Ni-Al behaves better compared with Sermaloy J and the non coated steel which are much more attacked than in laboratory. However, Sermaloy J and Ni-Al can lead to a real protection of a steel substrate but the manufacturing conditions have a great influence on the behaviour of the coated specimens...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The overall {{objective}} of the research effort is to identify, test and select candidate iron and nickel base alloys and aluminized coatings for applications in air and thermal management units of advanced SOFC power generation systems. It is also {{the objective of this}} study to develop mechanistic understanding of surface and bulk corrosion and degradation, long term protection and chromium evaporation processes. BACKGROUND: The air and thermal management units of the SOFC systems remain exposed to high temperature and oxidizing environment during the nominal and transient operating conditions. Materials of construction experience surface corrosion and <b>gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> products formation resulting in the loss of metal and chromium poisoning of the SOFC cathode. �Chromia forming iron and nickel base alloys have been conventionally used for the fabrication of such sub systems. These alloys remain prone to enhanced metal loss, grain boundary attack and surface oxide evaporation. Presence of water vapor in air has been reported to enhance such evaporation due to the formation of various oxides and hydroxyoxides vapor species 1 - 3. The long term successful operation of SOFC sub system requires minimization of metal loss as well as Cr-evaporation from the surface oxides. RESULTS...|$|E
40|$|Iron {{aluminide}} weld overlays containing ternary additions {{and thermal}} spray coatings are being investigated for corrosion protection of boiler tubes in Low NOx burners. The primary {{objective of the}} research is to identify overlay and thermal spray compositions that provide corrosion protection of waterwall boiler tubes. In the current phase of work, preliminary corrosion tests were conducted on a binary Fe-Al alloy in multiple complex gases to determine which gases {{will be used for}} testing of the ternary alloys. Preliminary solid-state corrosion tests were also conducted to simulate slag-metal interactions seen in Low NOx furnaces. Two powder compositions were chosen for testing of the ternary alloys. A matrix of alloys to be tested in both <b>gaseous</b> and solid-state <b>corrosion</b> experiments was produced based on corrosion literature...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{to improve}} the energy {{efficiency}} of waste incineration and biomass combustion plants continue to attract an increasing level of importance as the drive to improve energy efficiency and the {{security of energy supply}} continues to gather pace. All renewable sources of energy are important to help minimise the impact of climate change of processes feeding the ever rising worldwide demand for energy. Waste incineration and biomass combustion plants can make important contributions in both the short-to-medium and the long term. In the efforts to utilise these sources as efficiently as possible, a number of materials and process control issues are critical and <b>gaseous</b> and deposit <b>corrosion</b> are frequently limiting factors. This paper describes an integrated approach to the understanding of materials behaviour in waste and biomass boilers. The approach involves monitoring the combustion conditions on the grate of boilers in order to determine flue gas conditions that {{will have an impact on}} energy recovery as well as plant performance from the materials perspective. Plant monitoring was also carried out using a cooled process probe whose main purpose was to collect solids from the flue gases of a range of power plants. The deposits were then available for use in laboratory and pilot plant corrosion tests. An innovative process sensor instrument is described. From the materials side, the results of a comprehensive study involving the collection of thermodynamic and kinetic data relevant to boiler materials corrosion, and the building of a model enabling the prediction of corrosion behaviour have been described and used for materials selection. This integrated approach is started to enable more efficient materials studies to be carried out and in the same frame, improvements in plant process control to be achieved. JRC.

40|$|Several {{heritage}} {{systems have}} been studied using state-of-the-art synchrotron techniques. The cultural heritage value of silver is documented in museum collections across the globe. However, the silver surface is not as chemically stable as that of other precious metals, and is susceptible to corrosion by atmospheric gases. It is therefore of special interest to clarify these surface reactions by using in situ, time-lapse chemical and structural analysis in controlled ambients {{in order to develop}} strategies to reduce or even prevent the atmospheric attacks. In order to study the initial corrosion processes of silver in the presence of corrosive gases in situ time-lapse X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on the XMaS beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. Highly pure silver samples were weathered with synthetic air containing 500 ppb of both H 2 S and ozone, at relative humidity (RH) levels, and XRD patterns were tracked every 10 min over a total weathering time of 24 h. The time-lapse Synchrotron Radiation (SR) -XRD data show that pure silver exposed to those atmospheres starts to form crystalline corrosion products after only 10 minutes. Silver sulfates, silver oxides, intermediates and mixed species are formed on the sample surface over the duration of the experiment. The data collected using a newly combined environmental cell/gas flow set up introduces a set of highly useful tools for scientists who wish to study time-lapse <b>gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> at ambient temperature and pressure...|$|E
40|$|Iron-aluminum-chromium {{coatings}} {{were investigated}} {{to determine the}} best candidates for coatings of boiler tubes in Low NOx fossil fueled power plants. Ten iron-aluminum-chromium weld claddings with aluminum concentrations up to 10 wt% were tested in a variety of environments to evaluate their high temperature corrosion resistance. The weld overlay claddings also contained titanium additions to investigate any beneficial effects from these ternary and quaternary alloying additions. Several High-Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coatings with higher aluminum concentrations were investigated as well. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> testing revealed that at least 10 wt%Al is required for protection in the range of environments examined. Chromium additions were beneficial in all of the environments, but additions of titanium were beneficial only in sulfur rich atmospheres. Similar results were observed when weld claddings were in contact with corrosive slag while simultaneously, exposed to the corrosive environments. An aluminum concentration of 10 wt% was required to prevent large amounts of corrosion to take place. Again chromium additions were beneficial with the greatest corrosion protection occurring for welds containing both 10 wt%Al and 5 wt%Cr. The exposed thermal spray coatings showed either significant cracking within the coating, considerable thickness loss, or corrosion products at the coating substrate interface. Therefore, the thermal spray coatings provided the substrate very little protection. Overall, it was concluded that of the coatings studied weld overlay coatings provide superior protection in these Low NOx environments; specifically, the ternary weld composition of 10 wt%Al and 5 wt%Cr provided the best corrosion protection in all of the environments tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} {{vessels of}} advanced {{metal halide lamps}} are made of polycrystalline alumina (PCA). Such metal halide lamps contain a salt mixture, which in part vaporize under operating conditions. Important constituents of the fillings are metal iodides and bromides such as TmX 3, HOX 3, DyX 3, and NaX (X = I, Br). The understanding of the complex high temperature chemistry in such lamps is {{an important aspect of}} the development. The identification of volatile species present in the gas phase and the determination of valuable thermodynamic data for these species is the purpose of our investigations. The determination of thermodynamic data for gaseous species and condensed phases by the elucidation of vaporization processes is taken out by the use of high temperature mass spectrometry, which is the most versatile method for these studies. Corrosion attack of the discharge vessels made of translucent alumina is observed during lamp operation. This can limit their life time. An essential aspect of this corrosion attack is the gas phase transport of Al 2 O 3 in the PCA discharge vessel from the hot part to the cold side. Vaporization experiments were carried out using Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometric studies showed the formation of the vapor species AlX 3 (g) as <b>gaseous</b> <b>corrosion</b> product formed by the reaction of lanthanide halides (LnX(3)) with Al 2 O 3. The gaseous species AlO(g) and AlOX(g) were identified besides others on leaking iodine and bromine into the Knudsen cell filled with alumina lumps. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
