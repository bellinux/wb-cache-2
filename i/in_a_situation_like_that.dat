Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He could do something really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She wonders whether she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've never been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. If you try {{to force him to}} do what you want creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

500|$|On 7 October, {{the central}} bank of Iceland {{announced}} {{that they had been}} in talks with the Russian ambassador to Iceland, Victor I. Tatarintsev, over a €4 billion loan from Russia. The loan would be given across three or four years, with an interest rate of 30 to 50 basis points (0.3% to 0.5%) above LIBOR. Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated. According to RÚV, prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid-summer. When questioned on the matter in a press conference, Geir Haarde said: [...] "We have not received the kind of support that we were requesting from our friends. So <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> one has to look for new friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zimbardo {{reflects}} on the dramatic visual similarities between the behaviour {{of the participants in}} the Stanford prison experiment, and the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. He did not accept the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Myers' claim that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not reflect on the military. Instead he looked at the situation the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behaviour that they displayed. He began with the assumption that were probably [...] "good apples" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the Stanford prison experiment, where he knew that physically and psychologically normal and healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalising prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2001, Cuccurullo {{was asked}} to leave the band so that the {{original}} members of Duran Duran could reunite. At first the split was amicable, hinging on a financial settlement which granted him compensation from the band's forthcoming reunion album (to which he was not expected to contribute). Two years later relations soured considerably during the reunited band's American tour {{when he was asked}} by management not to attend the Los Angeles show after the band had invited him (no reason was given), and he began confirming some of the rumors that had spread about the 2001 split. Cuccurullo claimed that he was fired from Duran Duran by letter because Rhodes and Le Bon feared his reaction, though he told Duran Duran biographer Steve Malins: [...] "I would never get aggressive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> There were things that had to be sorted out in a professional manner, so, that's what I did.". Cucurrullo remained on good terms with Rhodes however, and in 2013 they released an album containing material from their side project TV Mania.|$|E

2500|$|Sara Firth, a London-based {{correspondent}} with RT {{resigned in}} protest over the network's {{coverage of the}} MH17 disaster. Shortly before resigning, she tweeted, [...] "RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)". She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." [...] She also stated that [...] "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason." ...|$|E
60|$|All this is true, and I {{think the}} lady {{might be more}} {{contented}} in her coffin, which is more comfortably furnished {{than most of the}} coffins where her fellow creatures live. Nevertheless, there is an answer to this, or at least a modification of it. There is a case for the lady and a case against the gentleman and the screw-driver. And when we have noted what it really is, we have noted the real disadvantage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of modern America, and especially the Middle West. And with that we come back to the truth with which I started this speculation; the truth that few have yet realised, but of which I, for one, am more and more convinced--that industrialism is spreading because it is decaying; that only the dust and ashes of its dissolution are choking up the growth of natural things everywhere and turning the green world grey.|$|E
6000|$|... --'Travels of Will. Marvel,' IDLER, No. 49. It {{was in the}} {{beginning}} of the month of November 17--when a young English gentleman, who had just left the university of Oxford, made use of the liberty afforded him to visit some parts of the north of England; and curiosity extended his tour into the adjacent frontier of the sister country. He had visited, on the day that opens our history, some monastic ruins in the county of Dumfries, and spent much of the day in making drawings of them from different points, so that, on mounting his horse to resume his journey, the brief and gloomy twilight of the season had already commenced. His way lay through a wide tract of black moss, extending for miles on each side and before him. Little eminences arose like islands on its surface, bearing here and there patches of corn, which even at this season was green, and sometimes a hut or farm-house, shaded by a willow or two and surrounded by large elder-bushes. These insulated dwellings communicated with each other by winding passages through the moss, impassable by any but the natives themselves. The public road, however, was tolerably well made and safe, so that the prospect of being benighted brought with it no real danger. Still it is uncomfortable to travel alone and in the dark through an unknown country; and there are few ordinary occasions upon which Fancy frets herself so much as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Mannering.|$|E

60|$|The queen {{perceived}} {{immediately that}} {{nothing but the}} most prompt and resolute action could enable her to escape the impending danger. She had but little bodily strength remaining, but that little was stimulated and renewed by the mental resolution and energy which, as is usual in temperaments like hers, burned all the brighter {{in proportion to the}} urgency of the danger which called it into action. She rose from her sick bed, and began to concert measures for making her escape. She confided her plan to three trusty friends, one gentleman, one lady, and her confessor, who, as her spiritual teacher and guide, was her constant companion. She disguised herself and these her attendants, and succeeded in getting through the gates of Exeter without attracting any observation. This was before Essex arrived. She found, however, before she went far, that the van of the army was approaching, and she had to seek refuge in a hut till her enemies had passed. She concealed herself among some straw, her attendants seeking such other hiding places as were at hand. It was two days before the bodies of soldiery had all passed so as to make it safe for the queen to come out of her retreat. The hut would seem to have been uninhabited, as the accounts state that she remained all this time without food, though this seems to be an almost incredible degree of privation and exposure for an English queen. At any rate, she remained during all this time in a state of great mental anxiety and alarm, for there were parties of soldiery constantly going by, with a tumult and noise which kept her in continual terror. Their harsh and dissonant voices, heard sometimes in angry quarrels and sometimes in mirth, were always frightful. In fact, for a helpless woman <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the queen, the mood of reckless and brutal mirth in such savages was perhaps more to be dreaded than that of their anger.|$|E
