25|$|The Orange and the Dutchess sailed from Newburgh for {{the last}} time on Nov. 3, 1963, packed with people and cars. The bells on board and on shore tolled as the boats crossed the river in the early evening chill against the {{imposing}} silhouette of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, which had opened the day before. Ten minutes later, when the ferries docked in Beacon and disgorged their cargo, people got in their cars or <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> the waiting buses and went home, over the new bridge. The ferries, built in the early 1900s at the Newburgh shipyards, were sold and, in time, scrapped.|$|E
25|$|In {{the infant}} {{years of the}} CWTS (then known as the SuperTruck Series), RCR fielded its own truck team, the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevy. 37-year-old driver Mike Skinner was signed to drive the truck for the 1995 season. Skinner won the series' inaugural race at Phoenix International Raceway, passing Winston Cup driver Terry Labonte on the final lap of the race. He {{went on to win}} eight races, and won the series first {{championship}} by a 126-point margin. Skinner won eight more races and finished third in points in 1996. Skinner scored a total of 16 wins and 15 poles over two seasons. After he left, Jay Sauter <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> board, winning four times and finishing in the top 10 in points all three years. He was the last driver to win for RCR in the Camping World Truck Series, until July 11, 2010, when Childress's grandson, Austin Dillon, won the Lucas Oil 200 at Iowa Speedway. After 1999, Childress moved the program up to the NASCAR Busch Series.|$|E
500|$|DeeKay of SoulCulture {{commented that}} [...] "even with the straightforward, hugely {{predictable}} electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating {{at a level}} above his David Guetta and RedOne-loving peers." [...] Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that [...] "Numb" [...] is a single quality track, [...] "which we can see seeping through the radio {{in the latter half}} of 2012– with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance." [...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> the bandwagon".|$|E

500|$|The canal {{also carried}} packet services, with {{passengers}} facing a three-hour journey between Bolton and Manchester. [...] The first passenger boat to Bolton {{was launched in}} 1796 from the Windsor Castle public house, and in 1798 a new packet boat was built {{for the use of}} the company. [...] Fares were initially fixed by the canal company (although from 1805 contracted-out) and based upon the service required; a passenger using the state cabin from Bolton to Manchester would be charged oneshillingsixpence, and a single shilling on the return journey. [...] Passengers would change boats at Prestolee to avoid delays at the lock flight and also to save water, and a purpose-built covered walkway the length of the road was constructed for their benefit. Another passenger service ran along the two arms from Bolton to Bury, and over 60,000passengers per year travelled on the canal; between July 1833 and June 1834, 21,060made the journey from Bolton to Manchester, 21,212people travelled from Manchester to Bolton, and 20,818intermediary passengers <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> and off the boats en route. [...] In 1834 the Bolton to Manchester service earned £1,177 and the Bolton to Bury service earned £75. [...] The service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services: central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board. [...] This caused a tragedy in 1818, however, when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize the boat and a number of passengers, including two children, were drowned.|$|E

"With Kennedy only eleven votes {{short of}} the nomination, Ted Kennedy {{approached}} the Wyoming delegation, where Kennedy was known to have {{eight and a half}} solid votes, Johnson had six, and one-half vote remained loyal to Adlai Stevenson. Suddenly one of Wyoming's leaders broke away from a frantic huddle with Ted Kennedy, <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> a chair, and held up four fingers to the delegates. [...] "Give me four votes!"

2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. Now and then he would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know you should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first player}} tosses the marker also called a [...] "lucky" [...] unto the court. This object should {{land in the}} square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is {{typically}} a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest" [...] are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest", the player must {{then turn around and}} return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.|$|E
2500|$|Givers came {{together}} in 2008, when Lamson and Guarisco recruited Kirby Campbell, Will Henderson and Josh LeBlanc for a two-hour slot at a Lafeyette pub. Lamson and Guarisco had never sung prior to joining the band, and Josh LeBlanc was a jazz trumpeter before learning the bass. The unnamed band <b>hopped</b> <b>on</b> the last-minute slot after another local band dropped off the bill, and improvised the entire set. They were phoned by the pub and invited back, and they continued to perform improvised sets. [...] "I mean, we weren't a band, we were just making shit up," [...] Guarisco later said. [...] "That was how songs were created, that total free-form state where we just played and recorded and then excerpted and rearranged." [...] The band scoured their iTunes libraries looking for interesting song titles they could narrow down for a band name; Guarisco picked a Lucky Dragons song called [...] "Givers." [...] The band recorded their debut EP in Campbell's bedroom, and released it online for free in 2009. After the newly christened Givers performed at Baton Rouge's stalwart music hall Spanish Moon, booking agent Aaron Scruggs gave the band what would become one the [...] "major accidents that became very fruitful occurrences," [...] according to Guarisco. For their Baton Rouge show, Dirty Projectors had a rare opening slot, and Scruggs gave it to Givers, who had been performing only part-time since their 2008 formation. Dirty Projectors were Guarisco's favorite band and a key inspiration in creating Givers. To prepare for the performance, the band rehearsed {{eight hours a day}} for a week. Frontman Dave Longstreth subsequently invited the band along as support for an East Coast tour.|$|E
