Zaovine is the area where Josif Pančić, a leading Serbian botanist, discovered the endemic Serbian spruce in 1875 on the nearby Kik hill. The hill was destroyed in the early 1980s and material was used for building the dam that created Zaovine Lake. There are over 600 plant species in the area surrounding the lake, of which 15 are protected by law, including the Serbian spurce and edelweiss.

The ecosystem was severely hurt by several renovations {{and the introduction of}} non-native fish species by fishing clubs as well as by individual visitors. In addition, the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) and other pet turtles have been introduced, ousting the native European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis).|$|E

Nowadays the water level upstream of the weir on the Ljubljanica River is too low therefore during low flow conditions the main Ljubljanica River channel is not connected to its tributaries. This represents a great obstacle for the habitat connectivity along the river reaches which is worsened by the improperly working fish passes. To enable fish migration along the river concrete restoration measures were performed. The reconstructions of sill and two fish passes on the Ljubljanica River have been implemented and barrier’s lifting system on the weir was modernized. During the entire project fish monitoring is being performed in different ways. It helps us to evaluate if concrete restoration actions (restoration of sill, two fish passes and a barrier) were successful and if fish migration is improved. We follow fish migration with marking the fish with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags. Regarding the location of catch we implant tags beneath transparent or translucent tissue combining different tag locations (dorsal fin, post ocular tissue) and colours (red and yellow). The success of restoration actions is monitored {{with the use of}} on line connected cameras installed on the fish passes. Records from the camera are analysed to evaluate number and type of fish using the fish pass. The data gathered from the fish monitoring will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} fish migration along the Ljubljanica and Sava River and will help to evaluate the project success...|$|E

40|$|Zadnje stoletje je sladkovodni ekosistem najbolj podvrţen človeškim posegom zaradi izkoriščanja vodne energije. Posledica posegov je, da so številne ribje vrste postale ogroţene in zaščitene z rdečimi seznami ali izginile. Zagotavljanje prehodnosti vodotokov je nujno za prehajanje rib, za ohranjanje ogroţenih in ostalih ribjih populacij. Ribe za svoje ţivljenje potrebujejo različne habitate za drst, rast, prehranjevanje, gibanje. Vsaka neprehodna ovira na vodotokih bi morala imeti urejen naraven, sonaraven ali tehnično grajen ribji prehod. Do izliva v reko Savo ima Ljubljanica kar nekaj neprehodnih ovir, zaradi katerih se je bistveno spremenila kvaliteta habitatov za ribe in tudi za ostale vodne organizme. V okviru projekta Ljubljanica povezuje – Obnovitev koridorja Ljubljanice in izboljšanje rečnega vodnega reţima je bila obnovljena ribja steza ob Plečnikovi zapornici na Ambroţevem trgu. Namen projekta je izboljšati in povezati habitate ciljnih ogroţenih vrst rib v Ljubljanici, to so sulec, platnica in blistavec, ki so zaščiteni z uredbami in pravilniki. V diplomski nalogi je predstavljena problematika prehajanja rib oziroma nefunkcionalnost ribje steze pred obnovo. Povzela sem obnovitvene ukrepe in izboljšave na stezi ter z meritvami pretoka in hitrosti vode na vtoku in v notranjosti ribje steze ugotavljali funkcionalnost le-te. Namen projekta Ljubljanica povezuje je tudi osveščanje ljudi o nujnosti vzpostavitve prehodnosti vodotokov za ribje populacije, tako iz spoštovanja do narave kot z vidika veljavne zakonodaje, ki narekuje obnovitev vseh obstoječih ribjih stez in gradnjo novih na območjih, kjer se bo posegalo v vodotoke.
