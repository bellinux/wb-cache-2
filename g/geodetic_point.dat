40|$|Raising of problem. Reliable {{results of}} {{geodetic}} monitoring depends on several factors. One {{of the main}} factors is reliability of <b>geodetic</b> <b>points</b> taken as the source {{for the creation of}} geomonitoring network. According to the current normative documents for the creation of horizontal and vertical geodetic networks, the stability of the <b>geodetic</b> <b>points</b> should be determined by the results of periodic monitoring of their coordinates. As practice shows this is not enough, because <b>geodetic</b> reference <b>points</b> simultaneously offset with the monitoring object. Therefore, the assessment of source reliability and systematic control of the base points of geomonitoring network are important. Purpose. To increase the reliability of results of geodetic monitoring which based on the use of stable reference <b>geodetic</b> <b>points.</b> To develop probabilistic intervals of errors of determination of coordinates of <b>geodetic</b> <b>points</b> of various classes based on which we can judge their offsets in the selection of a stable <b>geodetic</b> <b>points.</b> Conclusion. By sampling stable reference <b>geodetic</b> <b>points</b> on the interval estimates of the errors of the coordinates with a given level of reliability and defining the mode of their control, you can create a reliable geodetic monitoring network. Using this network for geodetic monitoring of engineering facilities will allow us to obtain reliable, valid observation results...|$|R

40|$|The {{graduate}} thesis first {{presents the}} basic concepts and the legislation of flood water. Afterwards, the geodetic measurement methods,which {{are used to}} determine the flood water height are described, including different calculation techniques. The heights of <b>geodetic</b> <b>points</b> in the flood-endangered area on Ljubljana Moor were measured by using the real-time kinematic (RTK) and fast static GNSS leveling methods. The acquired values were compared to heights, determined by the RTK method in year 2010 and by trigonometric leveling in 2011. The measured ellipsoidal heights are coverted to normal orthometric heights using local geoid, Geoid 2000, Geoid 2010. The heights of <b>geodetic</b> <b>points,</b> which were measured by the fast static GNSS method are compared to the given, defined height. The heights of <b>geodetic</b> <b>points,</b> which were measured by the RTK method are compared to results of old measurements, performed in the Ljubljana Moor area. Finally, an analysis of differences among the determined point heights along with differences among geoid heights, interpolated from various geoid models is presented...|$|R

One of the first historical figures to visit Děčínský Sněžník was Emperor Joseph II of Habsburg, who climbed the peak in September 1779. The Sněžník was considered an important <b>geodetic</b> <b>point</b> for triangulation and cartographers asked the owner of the principality of Děčín, Prince Franz of Thun and Hohenstein, for permission to establish the peak as a triangulation point. Prince Franz contracted the Dresden architect, Karl Moritz Haenel, to design a stone observation tower. The construction of the Neo-gothic tower at the summit of the Sněžník began in 1863.

This development has now seen the implementation of Internet based geodetic GPS processing services. Some of these Services use the so-called point positioning approach (the user {{does not need to}} be near an Active control point (ACP), IGS or continuous reference station (CORS).

40|$|Determination of Mean Sea Level (MSL) as a {{vertical}} datum for orthometric heights {{is a vital}} requirement for the readjustment of the National Geodetic Levelling Network. The vertical datum is defined to be the geoid whereby it's practical realization was brought by tide gauge obervations at very few selected points e. g. ports. Geodetic levelling observation could use these tide gauges as fixed points. Unfortunately, the so-called determined MSL differs significantly from the geoid due to local phenomena, such as sea surface topography, ocean currents, tides, etc. The solution leads to distortion in the levelling network or other height information. Using integration approach of the Global Positioning System (GPS) data connected between tide gauges, satellite altimetry data on sea near the tide gauges, derived potential differences (from levelling nets and gravity observations), gravity anomalies and the deflection of the vertical surrounding the tide gauges, the required reference surface could be precisely determined. From <b>geodetic</b> <b>point</b> of view, these data contribute to the vertical datum problem and is briefly {{presented in this paper}} by the expression of the associated parameters of the Integrated Geodesy Adjusment's Concept...|$|E
