500|$|The rest of {{his time}} in the High Court passed uneventfully, but he {{continued}} to be unhappy with his work as a judge, noting that [...] "I am nervous of myself, without much confidence in my judgment and hesitant about my sentences and damages and things of that kind. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> no glow of achievement in any summing up, though none of them have been bad." ...|$|E

[...] "Rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting {{to find a way to}} stop feelings that I find hurtful or damaging. In my case I want to stop the lies and hypocrisy of the church, the intolerance of many narrow minded cultures and societies I have experienced throughout my life and in some cases the pain <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> from having my heart broken." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Madonna {{commented on}} a letter {{published}} in Billboard: [...] "I do not condone violence {{or the use}} of guns. [...] Rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting {{to find a way to}} stop feelings that I find hurtful or damaging.

500|$|After {{four months}} of consideration, Mathias decided in March 1976 to not seek the presidency, and asked for his name to be {{withdrawn}} from the Massachusetts primary ballot, {{where it had been}} added automatically. He had also been considering an independent bid, but said raising money would be too difficult under campaign finance laws. Upon his withdrawal, Mathias stated he would work with the Republican Party in the upcoming elections. However, despite his pledge to support the Republican candidate, Mathias' criticism of the party did not wane, stating that [...] "over and over again during the primaries, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortably like a member of the chorus in a Greek tragedy". In a further criticism of his party's neglect of liberal voters, Mathias commented: ...|$|E
500|$|Penfold met {{his first}} wife-to-be while serving on St Vincent as Latin American floater. He was {{planning}} his wedding {{at the end}} of his term in Latin America but was persuaded to postpone it due to the urgency with which he was required in Canberra, and the wedding eventually took place later in 1972. The couple had three children, but his wife did not enjoy the overseas postings. They divorced in 1984 and Penfold travelled to Kampala alone. While in Uganda, Penfold met his second wife-to-be, Celia, who was working for the World Bank. They married while Penfold was Governor of the British Virgin Islands, making Penfold the first British governor to get married in-post. Both Penfold and his wife consider themselves committed Christians, and Penfold has stated that, [...] "as a Christian, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> more at home in Africa".|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} to Welmingham with my mind composed, feeling more sure {{of myself and}} my resolution than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> yet.|$|R

500|$|In {{relation}} to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that [...] "the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not {{and would never}} have been achieved by the law." [...] Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi [...] "most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma." [...] He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism. In a letter dated 25 July 1918, to Manganlal Gandhi, he stated, “To be sure, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharaya have robbed us of our manliness. They made the people incapable of self-defense... It was all to the good that people gave up drinking, smoking, etc., this, however, is not an end in itself, it only is a means. The love taught by Swaminarayan and Vallabh is all sentimentalism... Do not mix up the Vaishnava tradition with the teaching of Vallabha and Swaminarayan.” ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by {{those moments when}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> as if the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{felt like}} a cur! And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> so every time the thing had recurred to my mind, I may as well confess. I flushed hotly and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{have put}} up a more {{vigorous}} protest against troubling Mrs. Acton than I did, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> it would <b>have</b> been of any use," [...] he said.|$|R
2500|$|Despite such friction, their {{relationship}} {{continued to be}} close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: [...] "Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> I must have Mrs. Stanton's opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am all at sea..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 25 March, {{awaiting}} {{death in}} his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell {{letter to his}} expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt {{will be made to}} suggest that we had lacked support." [...] (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.) ...|$|E
2500|$|.....I {{want our}} nation {{to be the}} most {{beautiful}} in the world. By this I do not mean the most powerful nation. Because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> the pain of being invaded by another nation, I do not want my nation to invade others. It is sufficient that our wealth makes our lives abundant; it is sufficient that our strength is able to prevent foreign invasions. The only thing that I desire in infinite quantity is the power of a noble culture. This is because the power of culture both makes ourselves happy and gives happiness to others.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> that I could take the time to write and also that I had {{anything}} to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{the fear}} of war between the Soviets and the West reached a high point after the coup. On 5 March, General Lucius D. Clay sent an {{alarming}} telegram from Berlin that advised of its likelihood: [...] "Within the last few weeks, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> a subtle change in Soviet attitude which I cannot define but which now gives me a feeling that it may come with dramatic suddenness". General Omar Bradley later wrote that when he read Clay's [...] "lugubrious assessment" [...] in Washington he was [...] "lifted right out of [...] chair", and George F. Kennan wrote that the coup and the telegram had combined to create [...] "a real war scare" [...] where [...] "the military and the intelligence fraternity" [...] had [...] "overreacted in the most deplorable way". Only a week later, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended rearmament and a restoration of the draft.|$|E
2500|$|Hawthorne's {{time in the}} Berkshires {{was very}} productive. While there, he wrote The House of the Seven Gables (1851), which poet and critic James Russell Lowell said was better than The Scarlet Letter and called [...] "the most {{valuable}} contribution to New England history that has been made." [...] He also wrote The Blithedale Romance (1852), his only work written in the first person. He also published A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys in 1851, {{a collection of short}} stories retelling myths which he had been thinking about writing since 1846. Nevertheless, poet Ellery Channing reported that Hawthorne [...] "has suffered much living in this place". The family enjoyed the scenery of the Berkshires, although Hawthorne did not enjoy the winters in their small house. They left on November 21, 1851. Hawthorne noted, [...] "I am sick to death of Berkshire... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> languid and dispirited, during almost my whole residence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> {{inclined}} to do so, you would scarcely {{expect me to}} admit it? I don't mean because {{that would not have}} been complimentary to you," [...] he said.|$|R

2500|$|Spinoza's {{break with}} the {{prevailing}} dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, {{it appears to have}} been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: [...] "If anyone thinks my criticism [...] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> bound in the end to embrace the views I here express." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 3, 2006, Martínez {{stated that}} if he could not return to full strength, he might end up {{retiring}} after the 2007 season. [...] "It's getting better, and progress is above all what is hoped for", Martínez told the Associated Press. [...] "To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn't want that, then I would have to think about giving it all up." [...] Martínez added, [...] "It's going to be a bitter winter because I am {{going to have to do}} a lot of work. The pain I feel was one of the worst <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt</b> with any injury in my career." [...] But by December 30, 2006, Martínez was more optimistic: [...] "The progress has been excellent. I don't have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course." [...] Martínez also reported bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: [...] "I've put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that's one of our strategies." ...|$|E
