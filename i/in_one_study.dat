5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E

5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found to be}} more frequent than heterosexual coupling. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding.

5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.|$|E

5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that turnstones vary between these feeding behaviours based on individual preference, sex, and even social status with respect to other turnstones. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>studied</b> population, dominant individuals tended to engage in routing while preventing subordinates from doing the same. When these dominant individuals were temporarily removed, some of the subordinates started to rout, while others enacted no change in foraging strategy.|$|R

5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study</b> synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise.

5|$|Hormonal {{factors are}} capable of {{altering}} the mucosal barrier. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>study,</b> {{a small group of}} females with apthous stomatitis had fewer occurrences of aphthous ulcers during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or with use of the contraceptive pill. This phase is associated with a fall in progestogen levels, mucosal proliferation and keratinization. This subgroup often experiences remission during pregnancy. However, other studies report no correlation between aphthous stomatitis and menstrual period, pregnancy or menopause.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to translate the refined version of the Passion Scale (Marsh et al. 2013) in Chinese and test its validity and reliability. To do so, we first translated the Passion Scale in Chinese using back-translation procedures (Vallerand 1989). After a pilot study suggesting that the Passion Scale in Chinese was acceptable, university students completed an online questionnaire. This questionnaire contained the Passion Scale toward <b>one’s</b> <b>studies,</b> the passion criteria (for e.g. “my studies are passion for me”), as well as the level of flow and positive and negative emotions experienced when engaging <b>in</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R
