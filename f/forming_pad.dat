40|$|Protein {{arginine}} deiminase 4 (PAD 4), which catalyzes the post-translational {{conversion of}} peptidyl arginine to peptidyl citrulline, {{is widely regarded}} as one of the best new targets for the development of a novel rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic. In addition to its presumed role in this disease, PAD 4 is also a calcium-dependent histone deiminase that acts as a transcriptional co-repressor. Herein we describe the design, synthesis, and in vitro evaluation of two fluorescently labeled activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) reagents that specifically and irreversibly modify the active, that is, calcium-bound, <b>form</b> <b>PAD</b> 4 with equal affinity to previously described small molecule chemical probes of PAD 4 function. These fluorescently tagged ABPPs will be useful for identifying the conditions under which this enzyme is activated in vivo and may prove to be useful RA diagnostics...|$|R

50|$|In {{the rubber}} <b>pad</b> <b>forming</b> process only a milled lower die is {{required}} {{on which a}} metal plate is placed. Afterwards, {{the shape of the}} lower die is pressed in the plate with the rubber mold. In most cases, the contour, hole patterns and the like will be cut with a 3D laser cutter.The simplicity of the rubber press tool causes tooling costs to be around 85 to 90% lower than those of regular deep drawing while the variable costs are higher. This combination makes rubber pad pressing very suitable for smaller and medium-sized series (up to 5,000-10,000 pieces per year), even though traditional cutting, lace, welding, finishing etc. is used more due to the unfamiliarity with rubber <b>pad</b> <b>forming.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{road that}} he was {{following}} led across some public gardens beneath an avenue of trees, which, of course, {{at this time of}} the year, were leafless. This avenue was lighted here and there, and beneath one of the gas lamps Godfrey wheeled round to see Madame Riennes advancing on him out of the gloom. Her stout <b>form</b> <b>padded</b> forward noiselessly, except for the occasional crackle of a dead and frosted leaf beneath her foot. She wore a thick cloak of some sort with a black hood that framed her large, white face, making her look like a monk of the Inquisition as depicted in various old prints. Beneath the blackness of this hood and above the rigid line of the set mouth, stared two prominent and glowing eyes, in which the gaslight was reflected. They reminded Godfrey of those of a stalking cat in a dark room. Indeed, from the moment that he caught sight of them he felt like the mouse cowering in a corner, or like a bird in a tree fascinated by the snake that writhes towards it along the bough.|$|R

50|$|Rubber <b>pad</b> <b>forming</b> can be {{accomplished}} in many different ways, and as technology has advanced, so have the applications for this simple process. In general, an elastic upper die, usually made of rubber, is connected to a hydraulic press. A rigid lower die, often called a form block, provides the mold for the sheeted metal to be formed to. Because the upper (male) die {{can be used with}} separate lower (female) dies, the process is relatively cheap and flexible. The worked metal is not worn as quickly as in more conventional processes such as deep drawing, however, rubber pads exert less pressure in the same circumstances as non-elastic parts, which may lead to less definition in <b>forming,</b> and rubber <b>pads</b> wear more quickly than steel parts.|$|R

Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a <b>form</b> of <b>padded</b> bandage or mitten, {{to be used in}} 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.|$|R
50|$|While crude <b>forms</b> of <b>pad</b> {{printing}} {{have existed}} for centuries, {{it was not}} until the twentieth century that the technology became suitable for widespread use. First gaining a foothold in the watch-making industry following World War II, developments in the late 60s and early 70s, such as silicone pads and more advanced equipment, made the printing method far more practical. The ability to print on formerly unprintable surfaces caught the imaginations of engineers and designers, and as a result pad printing exploded into the mass production marketplace.|$|R
50|$|Rubber <b>pad</b> <b>forming</b> is a {{deep drawing}} {{technique}} that is ideally suited {{for the production of}} small and medium-sized series.

40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{and their}} tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) {{play a role}} in {{development}} of obesity by contributing to adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation. We have evaluated a potential functional role of TIMP- 1, which inhibits most MMPs, in in vivo adipogenesis. Local overexpression by injection of 3 T 3 -F 442 A preadipocytes expressing human TIMP- 1 (hTIMP- 1) in the back of NUDE mice kept on high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, had no effect on de novo <b>formed</b> fat <b>pad</b> mass. The fat <b>pads</b> <b>formed</b> from the hTIMP- 1 expressing cells did show a significantly larger blood vessel size as compared to control cells (57 ± 4. 8 µm 2 vs 38 ± 1. 4 µm 2, p = 0. 0017). No effect was observed on blood vessel density or on adipocyte size or density. Systemic overexpression of hTIMP- 1 by injection in the tail vein of an adenoviral construct 3 days before injection of 3 T 3 -F 442 A cells in the back of NUDE mice kept on HFD for 4 weeks, also had no effect on de novo <b>formed</b> fat <b>pad</b> mass. However, the blood vessel density of the fat pads from mice overexpressing hTIMP- 1 was significantly lower than in controls (587 ± 11 mm- 2 vs 806 ± 20 mm- 2, p < 0. 0001) whereas the adipocytes were somewhat larger (1477 ± 44 µm 2 vs 1285 ± 32 µm 2, p = 0. 03). Thus, in vivo local or systemic hTIMP- 1 overexpression did not significantly affect the extent of de novo adipose tissue formation, but the effect on angiogenesis appeared to be different. Local overexpression induced significantly larger blood vessel size associated with somewhat lower blood vessel density, whereas systemic overexpression was associated with significantly lower blood vessel density but did not affect blood vessel size. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Auxetic {{materials}} {{have a negative}} Poisson's ratio, which can enhance other properties. Greater indentation resistance and energy absorption, as well as synclastic curvature, could lend auxetic materials well to protective sports equipment and clothing. Sheets of foam often <b>form</b> <b>padding</b> within protective equipment, but producing large homogenous auxetic foam samples is challenging. The aim of this work was to investigate techniques to fabricate large thin sheets of auxetic foam, to facilitate future production and testing of prototype sports equipment utilizing this material. A mold was developed to fabricate sheets of auxetic foam − with planar dimensions measuring 350 [*]×[*] 350 [*]mm − using the thermo-mechanical process. The mold utilized through-thickness rods to control lateral compression of foam. Sheets of auxetic foam measuring 10 [*]×[*] 350 [*]×[*] 350 [*]mmd were fabricated and characterized. Each sheet was cut into nine segments, with density measurements used to determine how evenly the foam had been compressed during fabrication. Specimens cut from corner and centre segments were subject to quasi-static extension up to 30 % to obtain stress versus strain relationships, with Digital Image Correlation used to determine Poisson's ratio. Specimens cut from the corner tended to have a marginally higher density, lower stiffness and more consistent negative Poisson's ratio compared to those from the centre, indicating some inconsistency in the conversion process. Future work could look to improve fabrication techniques for large thin homogenous sheets of auxetic foam...|$|R
