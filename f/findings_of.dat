5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> beaver remains in the scat sampled.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning.

5|$|Based on the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> {{these and}} other studies in the early 1970s, the current {{consensus}} is {{that the use of}} methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by {{the fact that there is}} a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E

This method allows to solve not only problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> optimal service centers location in transport network but also <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> optimal location k-centers with the best vitality degree and selecting of service center numbers.
