5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as in the}} {{original}} Swan Lake, where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During bump and grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, {{it becomes clear that}} the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.|$|E

25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is {{as strong as it}} once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which was {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing both hands and other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not over yet. Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E
25|$|Gentle {{returns to}} the palace in Yzordderrex where he's reunited with Judith. The entire palace {{including}} the Pivot starts to collapse and while {{they are able to}} escape, Quaisoir is killed. Gentle and Judith go to Peccable's house and then return to Earth. Gentle decides to return to the house on Gamut Street where he attempted reconciliation 200 years before and some of the memories from that time return to his head. His returned memories include those of conversations with Joshua Godolphin and the ancestors of those in the Tabula Rasa, as well as a young man, Lucius Cobbitt. Also remembered is the moments after the reconciliation failed and the horror brought upon everyone when Sartori tampered with the ceremony and creatures from the in Ovo were released. Gentle has a vision of those killed attacking him, a sort of 'final rite of passage' as his memories return. A creature known as Little Ease sent by Sartori invades Gentle's mind and tells him that Sartori will use him to prevent the reconciliation from occurring by any way possible. When Gentle leaves the house, Little Ease releases all of Gentle's memories from the past 200 years <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> harming him tremendously. Gentle, scarred from the event later appears where some homeless people are living and is almost killed by one of them until he uses a pneuma to defend himself. He befriends Monday, a fellow artist. Judith meanwhile sleeps with Sartori, thinking that he is Gentle.|$|E
500|$|Max Byrd, {{writing for}} Salon, also {{called it the}} [...] "best {{biography}} of George Washington yet", concluding, [...] "Chernow's narrative is so rich, its scale so massive and epic, that what is new fits seamlessly into the wider picture... Chernow has gone into Washington's world, almost <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> and inhabited it." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{positively}} received. IGN's Eric Goldman gave the episode {{a rating of}} 8 out of 10, and commented that [...] "Dexter's voiceovers are a fun element of the show and a great insight <b>into</b> how <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> works".|$|R
500|$|Living in New York City, Stine recalls {{walking a}} dog in a park, when the title for the novel flashed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> He says he started {{thinking}} of what the 'Dangerous Girls' would be, thought of vampires, and [...] "sort of went from there." [...] Stine was excited about the book as it gave him the chance to write for teenagers again. Stine did research to follow existing vampire lore but admitted to adding [...] "good vampires" [...] who would restore victims.|$|E
500|$|Despite some criticism, The Destroying Angel {{changed the}} way Etty was {{perceived}} by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> generally {{with the aim of}} discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw The Destroying Angel as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. Fraser's Magazine described the painting as [...] "a sermon to [...] admirers... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that little gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson {{originally}} {{started writing}} the song, originally titled [...] "Heal L.A.", with Brad Buxer after the Rodney King verdict and following riots in 1992. The song was worked on throughout {{the making of}} the [...] album and its subsequent world tour in 1996 to 1997. In late 1997, when work began on the Invincible album the song was put on hold, but its completion was always a passion of Michael's. Jackson was inspired to finish [...] "Heal L.A." [...] after a meeting with anti-apartheid activist and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela in 1999. The songwriter stated that during a conversation with the then-President, the concept of giving was discussed by the pair. The singer revealed that it was during this interaction that the words [...] "what more can I give" [...] came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and he began writing. With the first version of the song completed, Jackson intended to premiere it at his MJ & Friends concerts, staged in Munich, Germany and the South Korean capital Seoul in June 1999. Ultimately, Jackson did not perform the song at the concerts and it remained unreleased.|$|E

Conversations with locals led Service to write about things {{he had not seen}} (some of which had not actually happened) as well.

2500|$|As {{the star}} comes nearer {{and the magic}} on the Discworld becomes weaker, Trymon tries to put the seven spells still in the Octavo <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> {{in an attempt to}} save the world and gain {{ultimate}} power. However, the spells prove too strong for him and his mind becomes a door into the [...] "Dungeon Dimensions", home to a manner of eldritch creatures. Rincewind and Twoflower manage to kill the now-mutated Trymon, and Rincewind reads all eight of the Octavo's spells aloud. This causes eight moons of the red star to crack open and reveal eight tiny world-turtles that follow their parent A'Tuin on a course away from the star. The Octavo then falls and is eaten by the Luggage.|$|E

2500|$|Emma Frost {{appears in}} Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53 {{as the best}} friend of mutant Sophia Sanduval, also known as Chat, and mostly uses her powers for {{personal}} gains. She {{is also one of}} the few people who knows Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man and grows interested in him. She uses her telepathic powers and briefly takes on the alias [...] "The Silencer" [...] to see what Peter is capable of. Chat begins dating Peter afterward. After Chat discovers Emma's schemes, Chat seeks Spider-Man's help, leading to a confrontation between him and Emma. Eventually, Emma confesses her crush on Peter, which she began to have after first looking <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> and realizing his earnest heroic beliefs and motives. She also reveals that she had caused everything in an attempt to break him and Chat up, feeling that she could neither date Peter while he was with Chat, nor could she spend time with Chat like she used to. By breaking them up, Emma hoped that at least she could reclaim Chat's friendship. She makes up with Chat, who still believes her to be good, and allows herself to be arrested, while Peter and Chat go on a date.|$|E
2500|$|The symbols used {{to compose}} {{addresses}} are actually pictorial representations of star constellations. By identifying six constellations in space, {{a single point}} can be interpolated that corresponds to the destination desired. As {{only a small portion}} of the possible combinations of Stargate symbols represent valid addresses, dialing the Gate at random is largely futile. In , SG-1 discovers a room on Abydos with a list of valid Stargate addresses and (luckily) a map that allows the SGC to compensate for thousands of years of stellar drift. In the series, the fictional planet Abydos could be dialed because it is relatively close to Earth, although in the film, Abydos was located in the Kaliam Galaxy. Another list of Stargate addresses is provided by Jack O'Neill in [...] from knowledge downloaded <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> by a Repository of the Ancients. In , a list of Stargate addresses in the Pegasus galaxy is found in the Atlantis database. The SGC assigns designations to Stargate-accessible planets in the form Pxx-xxx or Mxx-xxx; P standing for Planet and M for Moon. Samantha Carter explains in [...] that the designation [...] "is based on a binary code the computer uses for extrapolation".|$|E
