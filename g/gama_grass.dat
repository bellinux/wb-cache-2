40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of nutritive values in warm-season perennial bunch grasses with change in ontogenesis is essential to managing their use as forage for livestock or cellulosic bioenergy feedstock. Accumulated growth (not previously harvested) of Alamo lowland and accession 9065018 upland switch grass (Panicum virgatum), Lometa Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), Earl big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), San Marcos eastern <b>gama</b> <b>grass</b> (Tripsacum dactyloides) and Haskell sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), all native to the southern Great Plains of North America, as well as Selection 75 Klein grass (Panicum coloratum), originating in southern Africa but selected in North America, was harvested every 28 d for 3 yr, commencing 1 yr after establishment. Growth stage, crude protein (CP) and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) over 48 h were evaluated at each date. Some entries, such as Haskell, San Marcos and Selection 75, initiated reproductive growth earlier in the growing season and had higher nutritive value [up to 119 g CP/kg dry matter (DM) and 630 g IVDMD/kg DM] at seed set than those reproducing later in the season. Nutritive value of San Marcos and Selection 75 responded to autumn rainfall with resurging nutritive value (over 100 g CP/kg DM and over 600 g IVDMD/kg DM), whereas others did not. These nuances in nutritive value {{may be useful in}} manipulating species composition and season of utilization for grazing bunch grasses, especially when incorporated into opportunistic harvests of bioenergy feedstock.

40|$|Runoff from turf environments, such as golf courses, is of {{increasing}} concern {{due to the}} associated chemical contamination of lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ground water. Pesticide runoff due to fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides used to maintain golf courses in acceptable playing condition is a particular concern. One possible approach to mitigate such contamination is through the implementation of effective vegetative filter strips (VFS) on golf courses and other recreational turf environments. The objective {{of the current study}} was to screen ten aesthetically acceptable plant species for their ability to remove four commonly-used and degradable pesticides: chlorpyrifos (CP), chlorothalonil (CT), pendimethalin (PE), and propiconazole (PR) from soil in a greenhouse setting, thus providing invaluable information as to the species composition that would be most efficacious for use in VFS surrounding turf environments. Our results revealed that blue flag iris (Iris versicolor) (76 % CP, 94 % CT, 48 % PE, and 33 % PR were lost from soil after 3 mo of plant growth), eastern <b>gama</b> <b>grass</b> (Tripsacum dactyloides) (47 % CP, 95 % CT, 17 % PE, and 22 % PR were lost from soil after 3 mo of plant growth), and big blue stem (Andropogon gerardii) (52 % CP, 91 % CT, 19 % PE, and 30 % PR were lost from soil after 3 mo of plant growth) were excellent candidates for the optimization of VFS as buffer zones abutting turf environments. Blue flag iris was most effective at removing selected pesticides from soil and had the highest aesthetic value of the plants tested...|$|E
40|$|Five {{dual-flow}} fermentors (700 mL) {{were used}} {{to determine the effects of}} eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides [L. ] L.) diets on microbial metabolism by mixed rumen cultures. Fermentors were incubated with filtered ruminal contents and allowed to adapt for 4 d to diets followed by 3 d of sample collection. Five dietary treatments were tested: 1) gamagrass hay (GH) + no corn (GHNC), 2) <b>gama</b> <b>grass</b> silage (GS) + no corn (GSNC), 3) GS + low corn (GSLC), 4) GS + medium corn (GSMC); and 5) GS + high corn (GSHC). The experiment was conducted as a randomized complete block design with five treatments and three replications. Total VFA concentrations were not affected by diets. Corn addition linearly decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) molar proportion of acetate. In contrast, molar proportion of propionate was reduced in GSLC (cubic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) but remained similar across other diets. Corn supplementation linearly increased molar proportion of butyrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). The acetate + butyrate-to-propionate ratio was highest in cultures offered GSLC (cubic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 001) but similar across other diets. Feeding GSNC resulted in a higher ruminal pH compared with GHNC (P 3 ̆c 0. 03). Increasing the level of corn supplementation in GS linearly decreased culture pH (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). All diets resulted in similar methane production, with the exception of GSMC, which lowered methane output (quadratic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 004). Total substrate fermented to VFA and gas tended to be greater with GHNC than with GSNC (P 3 ̆c 0. 06) and linearly increased with the addition of corn (P 3 ̆c 0. 004). Neutral detergent fiber digestibility was similar between GH and GS and was not affected by supplemental corn. Microbial N flow increased in cultures offered GSHC (quadratic effect, P 3 ̆c 0. 02). Corn supplementation at the medium and high level linearly decreased C 18 : 0 (P 3 ̆c 0. 02) and increased trans-C 18 : 1 (P 3 ̆c 0. 004). Including corn at the high level with GS did not have a detrimental effect on fermentation in dual-flow fermentors...|$|E
40|$|The extent, {{diversity}} and breeding potentials of gene transfers between maize and <b>gama</b> <b>grass</b> were investigated. The original cross Zea mays x Tripsacum dactyloides (2 n= 72) {{was followed by}} seven backcrosses to several maize pollen sources resulting in a recovered maize bulk (2 n= 20). Four populations ranging from highly tripsacoid to maizoid were devrived through selection. They were studies for grain vield plus 17 plant and ear charcters, either per se or in F, or backcross (BC) combinations with inbreds 0 h 43, Mo 17, and B 73. Variance, correlation, stepwise multiple regression, and diallel analyses were used to differentiate populations. Polyacrylamide electroiphoresis performed on BC population A, B (tripsacoid), and C (maizoid) suggests genetic transfer from Tripsacum. Morphological {{studies show that the}} populations selected not aonly differ but also that they could be maintained during five generations for the intended kind and degree of tripsacoidy. Is was possible to derive a still more tripsacoid population D from population A. Phenotypic variability is greatest among traits indicative for tripsacoidy: length of lateral branches, number of ears, and kemel thickness decrease towards more maizoid introgression, whereas ear length, kernel number/ear, pith diameter, kernel and ear volumes increase in this direction. Correlation matrices show kernel thickness negatively correlated with eith ear and kernel traits for maizoid population C, while corresponding correlations for tripsacoid populations A, B and D are mostly non-significant or positive. Differences between populations C and D are strikingly obvious when comparing multiple regression response models for dependent trit kernel number/ear. Diallel analyses show significant differences due to general combining ability for prolificacy and ear length in BC's of populations A and B, and C respectively, with B 73, Traits for significant specific combining ability are grain yield, prolificacy and ear length. The upper 17 diallel crosses averaged 5, 225 kg/ha as compared to hybrid check's average vield of 5, 417 kg/ha. Evidence points to B 73 as the best inbred form maintenance of tripsacoide gene transfers during the described back-cross program. The successful controlled introgression procedure may encourage breeders trying to enrich the primary maize gene pool with different traits for plant architecture, floral and reproduction biology, and disease, pest, and drought resistance from Tripsacum. 199...|$|E
