The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven {{enjoys a}} mild climate.

5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto.

5|$|During the season, {{advisories}} {{were issued}} by Météo-France's (MFR) meteorological office at Réunion. At the time, the MFR area of warning responsibility {{was from the}} coast of Africa to 80°E, and the agency primarily used the Dvorak technique to estimate the intensities of tropical cyclones. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy– United States Air Force task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region, also tracked a long-lived tropical storm in November {{in addition to the}} 8 storms MFR named, which <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> average of nine named storms per year.

5|$|Gifu's {{estimated}} population, as of July 2011, is 412,895. The gender breakdown is 196,762 {{males and}} 216,133 females, {{with a total}} of 162,060 households within the city limits. Similar to many areas in Japan, the percentage of senior citizens over 65 years of age is approximately 21.67%, compared to only 14.13% of the population younger than 15. This <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> population of the prefecture and of Japan as a whole. In the prefecture, 22.1% of the population is over 65 and 14.4% of the population is less than 15 years old. Throughout Japan, only 21% are over the age of 65 and 13.6% are younger than 15. The average age of city residents is 43.37.|$|E
5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium {{is only the}} 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), {{but it is the}} 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} deposit consists {{mostly of}} loose material such as ash, lapilli, pumice, {{with only a}} few lithic blocks. This loose consistency may explain the lack of megablocks. Its total volume is about , less than the volume of the Mount St. Helens and Socompa deposits. It <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volume of the landslide that the Ancash earthquake triggered on Huascarán in Peru in 1970, resulting in more than 20,000 fatalities. Evidence points to previous flank collapses at Lastarria.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of the gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
