40|$|Previous {{clinical}} research has provided sound {{knowledge about the}} effects of heat and moisture exchangers on clinical pulmonary functioning, clinical symptoms, and intra-tracheal climate changes in laryngectomized patients. The aim of this thesis was to further enhance our understanding of how an <b>HME</b> <b>device</b> functions, to develop new techniques and approaches to assess HME performance. A newly developed, universally applicable ex vivo method that measures the HME water exchange performance, was introduced and validated. This method assesses the HME weight end-inspiratory and end-expiratory. A wide range of water exchange and humidity performances was found in 23 tested HME types. Next, we have found that the total water uptake of a hygroscopic HME during breathing is related to its humidity and water exchange performance. Loss of HME water uptake capacity was found after 24 -hour tracheostoma application, however, the remaining water uptake was still clinically acceptable. Tracheal mucus transport velocity and tracheal epithelial brush biopsies assessment were used to evaluate the effects of HME on mucociliary clearance. Significantly more ciliated cells were found in HME users than in non-HME users. The tracheal mucus transport velocity was not significantly higher in HME users than in non-HME users. The incidence of pulmonary infections in laryngectomized patients shows a tendency that the number of tracheobronchitis and pneumonia episodes is lower in HME users than in non-HME users based on a retrospective clinical study and a European wide survey among head and neck surgeons...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} the art of the {{existing}} heat and moisture exchange (HME) technology in use concludes that there are two main artificial humidification HME devices: active and passive device. The active device is complicated to use and expensive. The passive <b>HME</b> <b>device</b> is the preferred one, due to the ease of use and low cost. However it is not suitable for more than 24 hour use. This is due to current devices cavity design, limitations of HME materials performance and overall device efficiency. This paper presents the outcomes of the research work carried out to overcome these teething issues and presents a piezoelectric ultrasonic atomisation device for passive humidification device. This aims to improve the device heat and moisture exchange (HME) materials performance, by recovering the accumulated moisture, for a greater patient care. The atomisation device design, structure, working principles and analysis using finite element analysis (FEA) is discussed and presented in this paper. The computer simulation and modeling using FEA for the atomisation device has been used to examine the device structure. It also enabled to select the material of the active vibration transducer ring, investigate the material deformation, defining the operating parameters for the device and establish the working principles of atomization unit. A working prototype has been fabricated to test the device, technical parameters, performance and practicality to use in such intensive care applications. Experimental tests showed that the electrical working parameters of the device are: Current: 50 m-amps, Voltage: 50 volts, Frequency: 41. 7 kHz. The atomization device has been integrated into the passive HME humidification device and initial results show some improvement in moisture return of the device by 2. 5 mg per liter H 2 O. This is show the potential of the developed unit to improve the HME material performance in such working environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent decades, Heat and Moisture Exchange (<b>HME)</b> <b>devices</b> {{have been}} {{employed}} increasingly for short-term use in anaesthesia and long-term use {{in intensive care}} units. These devices work as heat exchangers, accumulating the patient’s expired heat and moisture and returning them to the patient during the inhalation phase. Porous matrices obtained from freeze-drying of blends of natural polymers exhibit high open and interconnected porosity and water vapour intake characteristics which make them possible candidates for <b>HME</b> <b>devices.</b> Preliminary tests were conducted on specimens made of gelatine blended with chitosan and treated with a non-toxic cross-linking agent. The tests were carried out in cyclic flow conditions with saturated and dried air. Results show water vapour retention comparable with accepted standards for <b>HME</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>HME</b> <b>devices</b> can be {{attached}} to the tracheostoma in two different ways: peristomally, by use of a base plate, to which the HME can {{be attached}}, and intraluminally, by putting the HME into a laryngectomy tube or a stoma button. Adhesive baseplates come in different shapes and properties to meet the users’ differences in anatomy and skin types.|$|R
40|$|Study Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of {{two different types of}} Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME filters) in reducing transmission of infection from the patient to ventilator and vice versa and also its cost effectiveness. Design: Randomized, controlled, double blind, prospective study. Patients and Methods: 60 patients admitted to the ICU from May 1, 2007 to July 31, 2007 of either sex, age ranging between 20 and 60 years, requiring mechanical ventilation were screened for the study. Following intubation of the patients, the <b>HME</b> <b>device</b> was attached to the breathing circuit randomly by the chit-in-a box method. The patients were divided into two groups according to the HME filters attached. Results: Both the groups were comparable with respect to age and sex ratio. In Type A HME filters, 80 &#x 0025; showed growth on the patient end within 24 h and in 27 &#x 0025; filters, culture was positive both on the patient and the machine ends. The organisms detected were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and co-related with the endotracheal aspirate culture. After 48 h, 87 &#x 0025; filters developed organisms on the patient end, whereas 64 &#x 0025; filters were culture positive both on the patient and the machine end. In Type B HME filters, 70 &#x 0025; showed growth on patient&#x 2032;s end after 24 h. Organisms detected were S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter. Thirty percent of filters were culture negative on both the patient and machine ends. No growth was found on the machine end in any of the filters after 24 h. After 48 h, 73 &#x 0025; of the filters had microbial growth on the patient end, whereas only 3 &#x 0025; filters had growth (S. aureus) on the machine end only. Seven percent had growth on both the patient as well as the machine ends. The microorganisms detected on the HME filters co-related with the endotracheal aspirate cultures. Conclusion: HME filter Type B (study group) was significantly better in reducing contamination of ventilator from the patient as compared to Type A (control group), which was routinely used in our ICU. Type B filter was found to be effective for at least 48 h. This study can also be applied to patients coming to emergency department (ED) and requiring emergency surgery and postoperative ventilation; and trauma patients like flail chest, head injury etc. requiring ventilatory support to prevent them from acquiring ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) ...|$|E

40|$|Organic-based {{photonics}} {{and molecular}} electronics are attracting an increasing interest in modern science. The realization of highresolution master structures by {{electron beam lithography}} (EBL) and their transfer to different organic functional materials by mechanical lithographies allow to fully exploit the wide flexibility of molecular systems for opto- and nanoelectronic devices. Planar nanojunctions, consisting of two metallic electrodes separated by an insulating medium, permit to test the molecular conduction properties. Since the typical size of a biomolecule is {{of the order of}} a few nanometer, hybrid molecular electronic (<b>HME)</b> <b>devices</b> need metallic electrodes separated by a nanometer-scale channel. Conversely, photonic applications often require 100 nm to 1 Am features on large areas. In this work, we report on the fabrication of both large-area periodic master structures with resolution down to 200 nm, and planar metallic electrodes with sub- 10 nm separation obtained by EBL followed by metal electroplating deposition. The fabricated 3 -terminal bio-nanodevices show a transistor-like behaviour with a maximum voltage gain of 0. 76. Moreover, we developed a number of mechanical patterning methods, including soft hot embossing, rapid prototyping, sub-micrometer fluidics, high- and room-temperature nanoimprinting, to fabricate planar nanostructures on both biomolecular and organic materials. These allowed us a high-fidelity pattern transfer up to 100 -nm scale resolution, without reducing the emission yields of light-emitting organics, thus opening the way to the one-step realization of organic-based confined optoelectronic devices...|$|R
