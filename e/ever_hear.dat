5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E

There was no question of applause. It was the silence of Gettysburg...No man has ever dominated the House as he dominated it tonight, and he knows it.|$|E

Most of it {{was recorded}} onto the same Studer 1" [...] two-track {{that was used to}} mix Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band! Everything was tracked live, and I’ve decided never to record wearing headphones again unless I absolutely have to. Wearing headphones is bullshit, because you’re in your own little world playing to a mix that no one will <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> but you. What’s the point? ...|$|E

When we put that record out, we knew {{what we were doing}} was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records. In {{addition}} to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used {{the company as}} an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse {{to serve as a}} creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Harrison explained: [...] "Most of the stuff will be what I produce". Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E
500|$|During the Alive or Just Breathing {{recording}} sessions, Killswitch Engage recorded 15 songs. Three of {{the songs}} were re-recordings of songs from the band's debut album. Stroetzel stated that the band decided to re-record [...] "Temple From the Within", [...] "Vide Infra", and [...] "In the Unblind" [...] because at the time, Killswitch Engage was unsure {{of how many people}} would <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> Killswitch Engage because it was released through a small label. [...] "Temple From the Within" [...] and [...] "Vide Infra" [...] made it onto Alive or Just Breathing. [...] "In the Unblind" [...] and two newly written songs titled [...] "When the Balance is Broken" [...] and [...] "Untitled and Unloved" [...] respectively, did not make it on to the album, but would eventually be heard on the 2005 reissue of Alive or Just Breathing.|$|E

500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks. When it came to fighting Shero {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I swear I have never told a player to attack another player. In fact, I have told my players if they <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask only that they play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight. Demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that [...] "You have to learn to win with what you got or you don't win at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer-songwriter David Gray {{commented that}} the great {{achievement}} of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found {{a way out of}} the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: [...] "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{tentatively}} set to be Hot Like Fire, later changed to Imagination, before being confirmed to be Irresistible on March 16, 2001. In the United States, Irresistible was initially slated for release on March 20, 2001. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the release was pushed to June 5, 2001. A listening party was arranged by AOL on June 4, 2001, a day before the album's release date. The album's release was celebrated with a release party at the New York Water Club. Simpson rode down Manhattan's East River on a yacht decorated with banners for the celebration, which included a water ski show, a fireboat spraying water, and fireworks. Simpson said the album's release was a critical moment in her career, one [...] "which could send her to stardom or obscurity." [...] In an interview, she said [...] "I'm right there ready to explode." [...] "Or I could go pfft [...] No one could <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> from me again," [...] she added. In the United Kingdom, Irresistible was released on July 16, 2001, and in Japan on May 25, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Despite its {{generally}} recognised prestige, {{the competition}} has been strongly criticised by some established Australian pianists. The pianist and composer Larry Sitsky said: [...] "The title Sydney International Piano Competition sounds grand and definitive. But behind the facade {{is a rather}} shabby private party in progress". The Liszt specialist and composer Leslie Howard said: [...] "I was asked {{to be on the}} international advisory panel for this years ago ... and since then have never heard from any of them. ... No-one, of course, will <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> from any of the prize-winners. They all seem to have had rather too close connections with members of the jury, which in any case is composed mostly of lacklustre teachers ... who have never been professional concert pianists in their lives and wouldn't recognise good and original artistry if it jumped up and bit them". Michael Kieran Harvey has asked: [...] "What does the complete lack of success past SIPCA winners have had at making a career say about the cloth-eared selectors who travel around the world at great expense auditioning young hopefuls? Why, if SIPCA is such an internationally significant competition, are second-rate teachers no-one's ever heard of, to say nothing of completely unqualified non-musicians, sitting in judgment at this supposedly premier music event?" [...] Despite his criticism, Harvey agreed to become the commentator for the ABC's radio broadcast of the 2000 competition, [...] "in an attempt to provide some objective analysis".|$|E
500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how he would feel scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on his tongue and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us <b>ever</b> <b>hear.</b> 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. An hour before starting the final leg of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga sent four tracks to Rolling Stone, including [...] "Scheiße", [...] "You and I", and [...] "The Edge of Glory", for a preview. Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of [...] "Hair", describing it as another inspirational {{song in the}} mold of [...] "Born This Way", but {{felt that it was}} a bit weirder. Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become [...] "n anthem for salons everywhere." [...] Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that [...] "although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure, she seems to be the most committed to the idea." [...] Dan Martin from NME classified [...] "Hair" [...] as an empowerment anthem, using the [...] "simple image of the wind blowing through a person’s hair to illuminate the album’s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> for a long time." [...] Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of [...] "Hair" [...] was not particularly a new one, since the 60's musical Hair also preached the same message. Although he described some of the lyrics as [...] "trite", Jonze opined that [...] "these weaknesses can also be strengths, and there's something admirable about the way the [...] address confused teenagers in search of their identity." [...] Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Leah Collins described the song as [...] "a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride." [...] She added that the overall feel of the song was that of retro dance music.|$|E

[...] He congratulated Letterman on his new show and wished him well, but also stated he was disappointed and shocked; he subsequently {{walked over to the}} man holding the cue cards, took two, and remarked, [...] "These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!", leaving the stage afterwards.
