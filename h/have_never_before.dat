500|$|Between {{seasons of}} Richard, in 1934 Gielgud {{returned}} to Hamlet in London and on tour, directing {{and playing the}} title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In The New York Times, Charles Morgan wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined.... If I see a better performance of this play than this before I die, {{it will be a}} miracle." [...] Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night [...] "to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time." ...|$|E
500|$|Construction on {{the line}} started in 1985. Survey and {{clearing}} work for the twin 2,500-foot (762 m) Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985. A 24-foot (7.32 m) long, 19 foot (5.8 m) diameter tunnel boring machine built by the Hitachi Zosen Corporation was shipped to the U.S. to drill the tunnel, which required boring techniques [...] "so novel that they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> {{been used in the}} eastern United States." [...] The tunnel boring machine ate through [...] "T5" [...] (relatively fine sand mixed with gravel and boulders which occasionally required workers to physically break the boulders apart) and clay formations about [...] beneath the riverbed. The walls of the tunnel were lined with concrete as the machine moved. Liquid nitrogen was used to harden the ground where the inbound tunnel reached the northern side of the Anacostia River, to lessen the possibility of cave-ins due to the wet earth.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower has a massive [...] thick pile-raft {{foundation}} embedded deep into serpentine rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, {{such as the}} Golden Gate Bridge, that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine. Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core {{is attached to the}} outrigger columns by diagonal, steel buckling-restrained braces which are designed to dissipate energy during an earthquake through controlled hysteretic behavior. This type of advanced seismic system performs {{in a manner similar to}} that of shock absorbers. The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> been applied in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Other columnists {{have argued}} that {{inaccuracies}} in the media coverage unfairly tarnish the town and {{have led to a}} national overreaction, part of the tendency in the 24-hour news cycle. Dallas Morning News columnist Heather MacDonald, while condemning the noose hangings as a [...] "despicable provocation", said that [...] "the media, the (race) advocates and pandering politicians have erupted in an outpouring of seeming joy at the alleged proof that America remains a racist country." [...] In a column in the Kansas City Star, Jason Whitlock drew attention to what he called factual inaccuracies in reporting of the story. He focused on the piece circulated by Bean to news outlets, [...] "Bean's story is framed—by his own admission—as an indictment {{of the criminal justice system}} and the people in power in Jena and, therefore, the story is unfairly biased." [...] Craig Franklin, assistant editor of The Jena Times, who says that he is the only writer to have covered this story from its inception, wrote in The Christian Science Monitor, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism. Myths replaced facts... the truth about Jena will eventually be known." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, fellow {{state senator}} Don Benton filed a {{complaint}} against Rivers, claiming she had broken a senate floor rule by swearing at him during a floor discussion. Benton also claimed that Rivers had screamed at him on one other occasion, during a Republican caucus. He claimed that he had felt physically threatened, saying, [...] "It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I {{have been on the}} receiving end of many heated comments over the years, but I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> felt the threat of physical violence." [...] Rivers responded with an apology; he took issue with some of the wording in the apology and he filed the complaint. Many have come out in support of Rivers, who claims that Benton was harassing her, adding she will, [...] "stand my ground against anyone who attempts to bully, intimidate or threaten me." [...] Some have labeled Benton a hypocrite, as he recently lifted sanctions against Pam Roach, who had been seen screaming on the floor and had mistreated staff. In a January 2014 decision, officials in the Washington State Legislature have decided both Senators were at fault for the spat. They determined that Benton had harassed Rivers, which provoked her. On the decision, Rivers stated, [...] "I have to conclude that he was trying to bait me into this reaction, which unfortunately he did.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2012, Astute rendezvoused {{with the}} Virginia-class {{submarine}} USS New Mexico underwater in the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center {{for a series}} of war games.

Royal Navy Commander Iain Breckenridge was quoted saying: “Our sonar is fantastic and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> experienced holding a submarine at the range we were holding USS New Mexico.

In the varieties of coins found in the Kashmir Smast, it becomes apparent that {{during the period of}} the Kidara, the Alxon, the Nazek, the Turk Shahis, and the Hindu Shahis, a minor kingdom based in this region maintained some level of autonomy from the greater Hunnic hordes which ruled Gandhara.

2500|$|In 1918 de Sabata was {{appointed}} {{conductor of the}} Monte Carlo Opera, performing {{a wide variety of}} late-19th century and contemporary works. In 1925, he conducted the world premiere of L'enfant et les sortilèges by Ravel. Ravel said that de Sabata was a conductor [...] "the like of which I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> encountered" [...] and wrote him a note the next day saying that [...] "You have given me one of the most complete joys of my career". Ravel also claimed that, within twelve hours of receiving the score to L'enfant, the conductor had memorized it. In 1921, while still conducting opera at Monte Carlo, de Sabata {{began his career as a}} symphonic conductor with the Orchestra of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. In 1927 he made his U.S. debut with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, substituting for Fritz Reiner in the first eight concerts of the year. He did the same in 1928.|$|E
2500|$|Garland {{states that}} after {{publication}} of Main-Travelled Roads [...] "the outcry... was instant and astonishing," [...] though in truth, reviews were balanced. Garland's writing was universally praised for the [...] "high {{quality of its}} description" [...] and recognized as coming from a source that knew the material well; it was his de-romanticized realism that proved more problematic. [...] In the Boston Herald, reviewer Louise Chandler Moulton wrote, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> felt the desperate unspeakable pathos of the prairie farmer's struggle with life," [...] before offering that the collection [...] "was far too minutely and baldly real to please my own taste". Popular author William Dean Howells praises Garland's writing in the book's introduction for being [...] "so robust and terribly serious… full of the bitter and burning dust… of the common avenues of life," [...] describing Garland's collection as [...] "a work of art, first of all, and we think of fine art". Such praise from one of America's most esteemed critics provided Garland with an ideal introduction to the reading public. The book was financially successful enough that Garland used his royalties to purchase a home in West Salem, Wisconsin.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1960s, Chomsky has {{maintained}} that syntactic knowledge {{is at least}} partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting {{that there is an}} enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: [...] "poverty of the stimulus" [...] argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the language acquisition device (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute [...] "universal grammar".|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
