5|$|<b>Immigration</b> {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all <b>immigration,</b> return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its <b>immigration</b> program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding <b>immigration.</b>|$|E

40|$|After {{the massive}} {{reorganization}} of federal agencies precipitated by {{the creation of}} the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there are now four main federal agencies charged with securing the United States’ borders: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which patrols the border and conducts <b>immigrations,</b> customs, and agricultural inspections at ports of entry; the Bureau of <b>Immigrations</b> and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which investigates <b>immigrations</b> and customs violations in the interior of the country; the United States Coast Guard, which provides maritime and port security; and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for securing the nation’s land, rail, and air transportation networks.

5|$|According to Citizenship and <b>Immigration</b> Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian <b>immigration</b> and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total immigrants to the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's refugees and has one of the highest per-capita <b>immigration</b> rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1924 that restricted <b>immigration</b> from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar <b>immigration,</b> which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E

5|$|Another {{impact was}} the {{competition}} with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish <b>immigration.</b> The increasing Irish <b>immigration</b> {{was seen as}} an economic boon by these antipodean countries.

5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The <b>Immigration</b> and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating <b>immigration.</b> Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1910.|$|E
