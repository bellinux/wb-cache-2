25|$|The Mongoose is a five-cylinder, single-row, {{air-cooled}} radial piston engine. The {{engine features}} twin forward-mounted <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos</b> and enclosed valve rockers, the cylinders being {{the same as}} those used for the earlier Jaguar engine. An unusual feature of the Mongoose is the vertical position of the lower cylinder, a design thought likely to promote oil fouling of the spark plugs.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{application}} for magnetos was as an <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto,</b> in spark-ignition petrol engines, ranging from early cars to aircraft (for reliability) and small engines such as chainsaws (for simplicity).|$|E
5000|$|... 1884: British {{engineer}} Edward Butler {{constructed the}} first petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine. Butler invented the spark plug, <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto,</b> coil ignition and spray jet carburetor, {{and was the}} first to use the word petrol.|$|E
50|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto,</b> or {{high tension}} magneto, is a magneto that {{provides}} current for the ignition system of a spark-ignition engine, {{such as a}} petrol engine. It produces pulses of high voltage for the spark plugs. The older term tension means voltage.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos</b> is now {{confined}} {{mainly to}} engines {{where there is}} no other available electrical supply, for example in lawnmowers and chainsaws. It is also widely used in aviation piston engines even though an electrical supply is usually available. In this case the magneto's self-powered operation is considered to offer increased reliability; in theory the magneto should continue operation as long as the engine is turning.|$|R
50|$|The Johnson Motor Wheel was {{designed}} in 1914 by Louis Johnson. It was patented in the USA in 1919 {{and in the}} UK in 1920.The initial design had problems at high speeds, so a fellow inventor from Indiana, Dick Oglesby, offered his <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos</b> to the Johnsons {{in order to address}} the problem. The Johnson brothers moved to South Bend, Indiana and formed the Johnson Brothers Motor Wheel Company to manufacture the kits.|$|R

50|$|Driving a Frontenac, Arthur {{qualified}} for the Indianapolis 500 again in 1916, but was forced out after 35 laps when the car developed <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto</b> problems. His driving career ended during practice rounds for the 1920 Indianapolis 500 when he was severely injured in a crash. Brother Gaston won that year's race in a Frontenac, but Gaston {{was killed in a}} California race a few months later.|$|E
50|$|The engines {{were used}} to power water pumps, generators, cement mixers and much more. They had a chain drive <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto,</b> either the Lucas SR1, the Lucas RS1 or a M-l MK1(shaft driven and early chain driven), and an Amal float bowl. The engines were made in 1 hp, 1.5 hp, 2 hp and 2.5 hp versions. The engine was a 4 stroke poppet valve engine, and, surprisingly, has {{overhead}} valves, instead of side valves and a simple centrifugal governing system.|$|E

25|$|The Manitou was {{a further}} {{development}} of the V-12 Maori III. Work on it began by Louis Coatalen in 1917. It used aluminium blocks rather than cast iron, cast in blocks of three cylinders, a typical Sunbeam feature. Bore was increased to 110mm, but stroke remained at 135mm. The banks were at a 60° vee, with twin overhead camshafts on each bank operating four valves per cylinder. There were two Claudel-Hobson carburettors and two British Thomson-Houston (BTH) <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos.</b> For aircraft use a reduction gear was fitted. The engine developed 300hp at 2,000rpm, later increased to 325hp.|$|R
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{petrol engine}} {{was built in}} 1876 in Germany by Nikolaus August Otto, although there had been earlier attempts by Étienne Lenoir, Siegfried Marcus, Julius Hock and George Brayton. The first petrol combustion engine (one cylinder, 121.6 cm3 displacement) was prototyped in 1882 in Italy by Enrico Bernardi. British engineer Edward Butler constructed the first petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine. Butler invented the spark plug, <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto,</b> coil ignition and spray jet carburetor, {{and was the first}} to use the word petrol.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a four-cylinder motor with a displacement of 3768 cm³ (bore × stroke = 100 × 120 mm) which produced 24 PS (17.6 kW). The engine had dual <b>ignition</b> (<b>magneto</b> and battery), automatic central lubrication and overhead valves. The engine power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a four-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The cars had a wheelbase of 3000-3200 mm, the track was 1450 mm and the weight {{in the case of}} the double phaeton was 1650 kg. The top speed was about 70 km / h.|$|E

50|$|Coatalen's next {{engine was}} an {{enlarged}} Crusader and {{was called the}} Mohawk. The Mohawk was a V12, side-valve engine, and (like the Crusader) was initially built with an 80 mm bore, which was soon increased to 90 mm. With its initial bore it developed 200 hp, when enlarged to 90 mm, it developed 225 hp and {{became known as the}} Sunbeam 225. Short seaplanes using this engine were often called “225s” because of this. The engine had two poppet side valves per cylinder, was water-cooled, weighed 905 lb dry, had four Claudel-Hobson carburettors, and two <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Realizing {{from the}} impromptu race that the Sun had no {{performance}} advantage over Rolls-Royce's latest development, W. O. increased the bore of his six-cylinder engine from 80 mm to 100 mm. With a 140 mm stroke, the engine had a displacement of 6.6 L (...) Like the four-cylinder engine, Bentley's straight-6 included overhead camshaft, 4 valves per cylinder, and a single-piece engine block and cylinder head cast in iron, which eliminated {{the need for}} a head gasket. In base form, with a single Smiths 5-jet carburettor, twin <b>ignition</b> <b>magnetos,</b> and a compression ratio of 4.4:1, the Bentley 6½ Litre delivered [...] at 3500 revolutions per minute.|$|R
50|$|Ancillaries were at {{the ends}} of the engine. A spring starter was {{at the front of the}} engine, {{together}} with a diaphragm fuel pump and a three-chamber gear pump. This pumped engine lubricating oil, seawater coolant and also provided a bilge pump for the lifeboat. The engine was stored dry, to save weight, and any slight overheating as the cooling circuit filled encouraged rapid warm-up, allowing full engine power from the outset. At the rear of the engine, outboard of the crankshaft coupling chain, a rectangular enclosure kept the electrical accessories dry. These comprised an electric starter, a dynamo generator and the BTH <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto.</b> The carburettor was an Amal.|$|E
5000|$|The mid-1950s {{and early}} 1960s custom Deuce was {{typically}} fenderless and steeply chopped, {{and almost all}} Ford (or Mercury, with the [...] flatty, introduced in 1939); a Halibrand quick-change rearend was also typical, and an Edelbrock intake manifold or Harman and Collins <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto</b> would not be uncommon. Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today. [...] Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro, Vic Edelbrock, and Offenhauser. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a [...] "slingshot" [...] design for the flatty. [...] Front suspension hairpins were adapted from sprint cars, such as the Kurtis Krafts. The first Jimmy supercharger on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.|$|E
50|$|The {{first car}} {{to use an}} {{alternator}} was an unusual system fitted to early Model T Fords. This entirely AC system was first used solely to power the trembler coil ignition system when the engine was running. When starting, a battery was used instead - cranking the engine was entirely manual. This system was sometimes used to also provide electric lighting. Being an AC system, there was no battery in this circuit. The starting battery {{was removed from the}} car for charging, a rare event as it was only needed when starting. The generator was usually described as a magneto, although this was not an <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto</b> (even though it was used to power the ignition) as it did not provide sparks itself.|$|E

5000|$|... 1897: Robert Bosch was {{the first}} to adapt a <b>magneto</b> <b>ignition</b> to a vehicle engine.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{is powered}} by the high {{compression}} version (6.1:1) (RAF specification) of the naturally aspirated Napier Lion, a W12 of 23.944 L capacity, producing 580 brake horse power at 2585 revolutions per minute (recorded at 5, 000ft - performance at ground level may be different). The 12 cylinders are in three banks of four (broad-arrow configuration), hence the triple exhaust system, and the engine has standard aerospace features such as dual <b>ignition</b> (<b>magneto</b> type) [...] The non-syncromesh crash gearbox (aptly named for the horrible noises caused by a mis-shift) has 3 ratios. The fuel tank, located in the boat-tail behind the driver, has a capacity of 65 gallons and fuel consumption was approximately 5 mpg. Although capable of 168 mph the car has rear-wheel braking only.|$|E
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with Robert Bosch he invented developed and patented the Simms-Bosch <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto.</b> It enabled engine designers to precisely time the ignition of fuel {{because it was}} tied to {{the rotation of the}} engine. Their initial low-tension system was not an unqualified success but they became the first to develop a practical high-tension magneto. In 1899 they established the jointly owned Compagnie des Magnetos Simms-Bosch but it foundered in 1906 on personal differences between the partners. In 1907 Simms established the Simms Magneto Company Ltd to manufacture magnetos under licence from Robert Bosch but he was unable to compete with European prices and it closed in 1913. He had however contributed to Bosch's business by his stimulus to their further product development and in opening up the French market for Bosch.|$|E
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the <b>ignition</b> <b>magneto</b> and later by Kettering's battery ignition system, using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{gasoline}} (petrol) {{internal combustion}} engines used a <b>magneto</b> <b>ignition</b> system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in piston-engine aircraft. The voltage {{produced by a}} magneto {{is dependent on the}} speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier.
