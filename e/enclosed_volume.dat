500|$|The main process {{building}} surpassed The Pentagon as {{the largest}} building in the world, with a floor area of , and an <b>enclosed</b> <b>volume</b> of [...] [...] Construction required [...] of concrete, and [...] of gas pipes. Because uranium hexafluoride corrodes steel, and steel piping had to be coated in nickel, smaller pipes were made of copper or monel. The equipment operated under vacuum pressures, so plumbing had to be air tight. Special {{efforts were made to}} create as clean an environment as possible to areas where piping or fixtures were being installed. J. A. Jones established a special cleanliness unit on 18 April 1944. Buildings were completely sealed off, air was filtered, and all cleaning was with vacuum cleaners and mopping. Workers wore white lintless gloves. At the peak of construction activity in May 1945, 25,266 people were employed on the site.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} converting the contours of a rotated object's profiles into a volumetric object description that is suitable for an integration of complementary visual shape cues. In contrast to traditional shape from contours algorithms, the method {{presented in this paper}} does not attempt to construct an 'optimum' solution but rather finds an <b>enclosing</b> <b>volume</b> which must contain the true solution. In this way, an infinite set of solutions is compactly represented which is compatible with the contours in all available views. In the experimental set-up, the object is recorded from multiple viewing angles with a fixed camera. The recorded frames then pass a segmentation step which is carefully designed so that the true object volume will lie inside the reconstructed <b>enclosing</b> <b>volume.</b> The resulting segments are integrated into a voxel based description of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>volume.</b> For illustration purposes, the procedure is tested on a few general objects such as both a hum [...] ...|$|R

Thus, {{it is important that the}} <b>enclosed</b> water <b>volume</b> fraction can be determined in a simple and straightforward manner after preparation. In this work, a method is developed to determine the <b>enclosed</b> water <b>volume</b> fraction of W/O/W-type double emulsions using analytical photocentrifugation after which the results are compared to the <b>enclosed</b> water <b>volume</b> fraction as determined using pulsed field gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new technique}} for visualizing complex, nested features in multivariate volume data sets, such as those commonly found in medical imaging applications. Our work focuses on radiation therapy planning, {{where the problem is}} to locate `hot' and `cold' spots in a radiation dose field, inside a target tumour and surrounding organs. It is essential to visualize these different features simultaneously in order to understand their spatial relationships. To guarantee that certain key features inside a volume are visible, we dynamically create a series of circular tunnels through the <b>enclosing</b> <b>volumes.</b> As the viewpoint is rotated, the tunnel orientations remain aligned with the viewing direction. This guarantees visibility, while ensuring that a minimal amount of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>volumes</b> is removed, so retaining important, contextual, spatial cues. However, the changing tunnel orientations do not accord with our normal, everyday experience, leading to problems of interpretation. When vi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A robust, accurate, and {{computationally}} efficient interface tracking {{algorithm is}} {{a key component of}} an embedded/immersed computational framework for the solution of fluid-structure interaction problems with complex and deformable geometries. To a large extent, the design of such an algorithm has focused on the case of a closed embedded interface and a Cartesian Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grid. Here, two robust and efficient interface tracking computational algorithms capable of operating on structured as well as unstructured three-dimensional CFD grids are presented. The first one is based on a projection approach, whereas the second one is based on a collision approach. The first algorithm is faster. However, it is restricted to closed interfaces and resolved <b>enclosed</b> <b>volumes.</b> The second algorithm is therefore slower. However, it can handle open shell surfaces and underresolved <b>enclosed</b> <b>volumes.</b> Both computational algorithms exploit the bounding box hierarchy technique and its parallel distributed implementation to efficiently store and retrieve the elements of the discretized embedded interface. They are illustrated, and their respective performances are assessed and contrasted, with the solution of three-dimensional, nonlinear, dynamic fluid-structure interaction problems pertaining to aeroelastic and underwater implosion applications.

50|$|According to Plateau's laws, {{the minimum}} area shape that <b>encloses</b> any <b>volume</b> {{or set of}} volumes must take a form {{commonly}} seen in soap bubbles in which surfaces of constant mean curvature meet in threes, forming dihedral angles of 2/3. In a standard double bubble, these surfaces are patches of spheres, and the curve where they meet is a circle. When the two <b>enclosed</b> <b>volumes</b> are different from each other, there are three spherical surfaces, two {{on the outside of}} the double bubble and one in the interior, separating the two volumes from each other; the radii of the spheres is inversely proportional to the pressure differences between the volumes they separate, according to the Young-Laplace equation. When the two volumes are equal, the middle surface is instead a flat disk, which can be interpreted as a patch of an infinite-radius sphere.|$|R
