25|$|Gay Mullins, a Seattle retiree {{looking to}} start a public {{relations}} firm with $120,000 of borrowed money, formed the organization Old Cola Drinkers of America on May 28 to lobby Coca-Cola to either reintroduce the old formula or sell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. His organization eventually received over 60,000 phone calls. He also filed a class action lawsuit against the company (which was quickly dismissed by a judge who said he preferred the taste of Pepsi), while nevertheless expressing interest in landing The Coca-Cola Company as a client of his new firm should it reintroduce the old formula. In two informal blind taste tests, Mullins either failed to distinguish New Coke from old or expressed a preference for New Coke.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized. As a result, the album lacks a title on the cover, which was an unusual {{approach}} for bands at the time. Powell later said, [...] "When we showed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> at the label, he said, 'They are so hot right now, we could sell it in a brown paper bag'". Atlantic initially intended to title the album The Kind We Grow in Dixie, but the band refused. The title was the label of the postcard series Powell had seen in Athens. Trucks suggested they name the album Eat a Peach for Peace, after a quote from Duane Allman.

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts. The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E

Ivan threatens the homophobic group with a cricket bat and tells them that he is Paul's boyfriend. Ivan is shocked that he finally admitted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> but still insists that they remain quiet upon returning to the village. Nicola thinks that Paul is seeing someone and attempts {{to find out who}} it is. She tells Laurel that she still likes Ivan. When Paul does his drag queen act [...] "Thelma Louise" [...] at The Woolpack, he makes jibes about having a secret boyfriend and drops hints. Ivan gets angry and the pair argue in the toilets, unaware that the whole pub can still hear them because Paul forgets to switch off his microphone. Ivan accuses Paul of doing it on purpose, but he eventually deals with being outed.|$|E
500|$|Each {{release of}} [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{included}} {{one or more}} B-sides. [...] "Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)", included on the CD1, 7-inch vinyl, and Japanese releases of the single, were a multi-section piece formatted much like [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] itself. The {{first part of the}} song consists of Yorke's vocals over acoustic guitar; the second part contains distorted guitar and organ and uses complex time signature changes. [...] "Pearly*", featured on the CD1 and Japanese releases of the single, was described by Yorke as a [...] "dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things". [...] "A Reminder", which appears on the CD2 release, features fuzzed guitar, thumping drums, and electric piano. According to Yorke, this song was inspired by [...] "this idea of someone writing a song, sending <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone,</b> and saying: 'If I ever lose it, you just {{pick up the phone and}} play this song back to remind me.'" [...] "Melatonin", also on the CD2 release, is a synthesiser-based song with lyrics similar to that of a lullaby, but with an undercurrent of menace in lines like [...] "Death to all who stand in your way". The OK Computer track [...] "Let Down" [...] is also included on the Japanese single.|$|E
500|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22. The people {{discussed}} if Cisneros should stay in power and, in the case he was removed from office, which type of government should be established. Saavedra stayed silent for the most part, awaiting his turn to speak. The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, Juan José Castelli, Ruiz Huidobro, Manuel Genaro Villota, Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola, among others. Saavedra {{was the last one}} to speak, and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta, in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate. In his speech, he pointed out the phrase: [...] "(...) [...] "And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command." [...] This statement was in line with the Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, a political concept formulated by Castelli, stating that {{in the absence of the}} rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples, who had then the power to give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra's, becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes.|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|The trio {{became so}} excited {{with the concept}} they came up with, they decided to do initial {{development}} on their own instead of pitching <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. The Wachowskis wrote three hour-long spec scripts, and together with Straczynski attempted to shop them around, such as at Warner Bros. and HBO, but when they saw that nobody could understand the concept they decided to shelve it. A few years later, when they felt that the landscape of television had become friendlier towards more experimental concepts, they decided to pitch it a second time. On October 2, 2012, Variety first reported {{the existence of the}} show, by writing that the Wachowskis, with the help of Straczynski's Studio JMS and Georgeville Television, would be shopping Sense8 around Los Angeles the week to follow. If the series was picked up, the sisters and Straczynski would be sharing showrunner duties. Additionally, the Wachowskis were planning to direct a few episodes of the show if their schedule permitted it. According to Straczynski, the first meeting with potential buyers was with Netflix. The Wachowskis and Straczynski talked to them about subjects such as gender, identity, secrecy and privacy. According to Lana they pitched shooting on location all over the globe to which Netflix responded favorably, which was in contrast to the [...] "clearly impossible" [...] response they had received by other outlets during their earlier abortive attempt. They also told Netflix they were only interested if they had the freedom to [...] "do anything", like [...] "crazy psychic orgies with all sorts of different bodies" [...] and [...] "live births even" [...] to which Netflix also responded positively. After the end of the meeting, despite it having seemingly gone well, they worried they had made a mistake because they had not pitched any action or otherwise commercial aspects. By noon, and before they had the chance to pitch it to other outlets, such as HBO, Netflix called them to preemptively offer to buy and produce the first season. Netflix announced that they had ordered a 10-episode first season for the series on March 27, 2013. Later, during filming, because of the density of the scripts and the extended length of the first cut of the first episode, the showrunners and Netflix came to an agreement to extend the season to 12 episodes. The Wachowskis and Straczynski's production company that was set up to run the show was named Unpronounceable Productions. The name was suggested by Straczynski, as a joke that references the difficulty of pronouncing the showrunners' long last names.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{programme}} typically contains few non-trivial stunts or dramatic special effects, {{the first}} episode includes an example of Ash Morgan's favourite con, known as [...] "The Flop": having previously received a fractured skull in a bar brawl, Morgan deliberately steps in front of moving cars and exaggerates the accident. Although not actually hurt, X-ray scans show his fractured skull, and the driver's insurance company pays out a compensation claim. Glenister balked at doing the entire stunt himself, saying [...] "I got a stunt man who did all the smashing against the windscreen stunts but I did everything else...

2500|$|The most cogent {{example of}} how the {{different}} theories treat similar assets is tropical rainforest ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of Ecuador. [...] While this area has substantial deposits of bitumen {{it is also one of}} the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen. [...] Effectively, the instructional capital of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the carbon credit for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867, PHC {{reported}} that it received income of $1,500 ($ in [...] dollars) {{in the past six}} months, expended $500 in improvements and repairs, and was in excellent financial condition.

Haiden, Christopher Just, H. Kaiser, John Killian, and August Lipold. By 1870, however, the cemetery faced a problem: A significant number of individuals had purchased lots but failed to pay. Beginning on February 9, 1870, PHC announced that lotholders in arrears must complete payment by June 30, or the cemetery would seize their lot and sell to <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> else. Nearly all lot sales in the past had been to members of the German Evangelical Church Society, but now sales to non-members, including many who were neither German nor Lutheran, expanded rapidly. Throughout most of the 1870s, the cemetery's superintendent was Christopher Buechler.|$|E
