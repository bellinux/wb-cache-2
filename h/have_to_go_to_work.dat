6000|$|... "Yes, perhaps I can; but I'll hate to, mightily. That shanty of mine won't seem half so nice, after we've lived here, an' I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> sellin' papers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; it's a very cramped {{world to}} some of us; but {{complaining}} won't do any good," [...] She paused with a faint sigh. [...] "Don't spoil this evening. You and Mr. Carroll have been very kind. It's so quiet and calm here--though it was pleasant on board the yacht--and soon we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> again." ...|$|E

'Why, you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Doctors' Commons with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a {{court of}} Common Law with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lords with a suit, and you'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if {{it was a case}} of very plain sailing), I suppose from a {{thousand}} to fifteen hundred pound,' said Mr. Bounderby. 'Perhaps twice the money.' ...|$|R

I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an eye factory and find the eyes. False teeth. There's a lot in that photograph. I think John's almost-last written words were about that {{particular}} cover; that was {{pointed out to me}} by Martin Harrison, who wrote the text to my book.

Mr. Poole claimed that it was the fault of the school and so he took Nat away and told him he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> I think Nat is working in some store, although where, I don't know." ...|$|E
60|$|She saw that, {{felt his}} resentment. But she {{more and more}} often invited an {{ambition}} to go back to work, to be independent and busy, no matter how weary she might become. To die, if need be, in the struggle. Certainly that death would be better than being choked in muck.... One of them would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> anyway.|$|E

The Dutch element gives steadiness, the English vigour, and the French spirit.--By the way, Arend," [...] he continued, turning to one of his stout olive-branches, [...] "talking of spirit reminds me that you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at that leak in the dam with more spirit than usual, for we can't afford to lose water in this dry weather. It is not finished, I think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't," [...] she continued, [...] "that I'm {{afraid to}} go back to the bar. I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> some where, I suppose, but it isn't that. I want to know," [...] she leaned a little forward,--"I want to know who it is that has robbed me of my husband. I don't care what he was to other people! He was very good to me, and I loved him. I should like to see the person who killed him hanged!" ...|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, {{so help me}} I won't. Don't you {{be afraid}} that I'll save it and spare it and live idle on it. There won't be a penny of it left by Monday: I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> same as if I'd never had it. It won't pauperize me, you bet. Just one good spree for myself and the missus, giving {{pleasure}} to ourselves and employment to others, and satisfaction to you to think it's not been throwed away. You couldn't spend it better.|$|E

6000|$|... "We are not now in {{the days}} of the Great Skirmish," [...] replied his {{dragoman}} somewhat coldly. [...] "At that time any soldier who found his wife unfaithful, as we call it, could shoot her with impunity and receive the plaudits and possibly a presentation from the populace, though he himself may not have been impeccable while away--a masterly method of securing a divorce. But, as I told you, our procedure has changed since then; and even soldiers now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in this roundabout fashion." ...|$|E
60|$|He toiled on, {{miserable and}} well-nigh hopeless. It {{began to appear}} {{to him that the}} second battle was lost and that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> In doing this he would satisfy everybody--the grocer, his sister, Ruth, and even Maria, to whom he owed a month's room rent. He was two months behind with his type-writer, and the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the machine. In desperation, all but ready to surrender, to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start, he took the civil service {{examinations}} for the Railway Mail. To his surprise, he passed first. The job was assured, though when the call would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you know}} {{anything}} about crooks, young man,' he said, 'you'll know that outside of their own line they are the easiest marks that ever happened. They fall for anything. At least, it's always been that way with me. No sooner did I get together a sort of pile and start out for the old town, when some smooth stranger would come along and steer me up against some skin-game, and back I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> That happened a few times, and when I did manage at last to get home with the dough I found she had married another guy. It's hard on women, you see,' he explained chivalrously. 'They get lonesome and Roving Rupert doesn't show up, so they have to marry Stay-at-Home Henry just to keep from getting the horrors.' ...|$|E

60|$|Supper was {{the family}} meal of the day--the one meal at which Johnny {{encountered}} his younger brothers and sisters. It partook {{of the nature of}} an encounter, to him, for he was very old, while they were distressingly young. He had no patience with their excessive and amazing juvenility. He did not understand it. His own childhood was too far behind him. He was like an old and irritable man, annoyed by the turbulence of their young spirits that was to him arrant silliness. He glowered silently over his food, finding compensation in the thought that they would soon <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> That would take the edge off of them and make them sedate and dignified--like him. Thus it was, after the fashion of the human, that Johnny made of himself a yardstick with which to measure the universe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{have got}} him away. He is in hiding {{within a mile}} of this place. He kept on like a hero. I was utterly tired myself, and how he managed to walk the {{distance}} after what he had gone through in the day is more than I can tell. His name is Mendez. He is a trader in Cadiz, and owns many vessels. He {{was on his way to}} Italy, with his wife and daughter, in one of his own ships, in order to gratify the desire of his wife to visit the holy places at Rome. She was killed by a cannon shot during the fight, and his whole heart is now wrapped up in his daughter. And now, Stephen, I must lie down and sleep. You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> alone today again, and can truly say that I am still unfit for labour." ...|$|E
6000|$|The honour of {{representing}} the borough of Percycross in Parliament was very great, and Sir Thomas, no doubt, did enjoy {{it after a}} fashion; but it {{was by no means}} an unalloyed pleasure. While he was still in bed with his broken arm at the Percy Standard, many applications for money had been made to him. This man wanted a sovereign, that man a five-pound-note, and some poor starving wretch a half-a-crown; and they all came to him with notes from Trigger, or messages from Spicer or Spiveycomb, to the effect that as the election was now over, the money ought to be given. The landlord of the Percy Standard was on such occasions very hard upon him. [...] "It really will do good, Sir Thomas." [...] "It is wanted, Sir Thomas." [...] "It will make a good feeling in the town, Sir Thomas, and we don't know how soon we may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> again." [...] Sir Thomas was too weak in health to refuse. He gave the sovereigns, the five-pound-notes, and the half-crowns, and hurried back home as quickly as he was able.|$|E
