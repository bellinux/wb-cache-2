5|$|Depletion or {{enrichment}} of europium in minerals {{relative to}} other rare-earth elements {{is known as the}} europium anomaly. Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes that form <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> (rocks that cooled from magma or lava). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Titanium is the ninth-most {{abundant}} {{element in}} Earth's crust (0.63% by mass) and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is present as oxides in most <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks,</b> in sediments derived from them, in living things, and natural bodies of water. Of the 801 types of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> analyzed by the United States Geological Survey, 784 contained titanium. Its proportion in soils is approximately 0.5 to 1.5%.|$|E
40|$|This site explores {{two kinds}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> pumice and granite. Pumice {{is an example of}} {{extrusive}} <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> while granite is an example of intrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rock.</b> Intrusive indicates that the magma was forced close to the surface, but then cooled more slowly underneath the surface. The question, "How hot is Lava?" is linked to an explanation of the heat of lava, why it must be sampled when it is very hot, and how the samples are taken.

25|$|Mount Cayley {{consists}} {{mostly of}} an <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> {{with a high}} iron content called dacite, although another <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> rhyodacite, with intermediate composition of dacite and rhyolite is also present. Unlike {{many of the other}} volcanoes further south, Cayley does not dominate the surrounding landscape, which consists of high, rugged peaks.|$|R
50|$|In <b>igneous</b> and {{metamorphic}} <b>rocks,</b> {{grain size}} {{is a measure}} of the sizes of the crystals in the <b>rock.</b> In <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> this is used to determine the rate at which the material cooled: large crystals typically indicate intrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>rock,</b> while small crystals indicate that the rock was extrusive. As metamorphic reactions progress, the grains in metamorphic rocks can often be broken down into smaller grains.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating {{the age of the}} earliest <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> and for other types of radiometric dating, including uranium–thorium dating, uranium–lead dating and uranium–uranium dating. Uranium metal is used for X-ray targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism; the rock has been pressure-cooked. This somber, gray, almost featureless crystalline complex is composed of originally sedimentary and <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> with large quantities of quartz and feldspar mixed in. The original rocks were transformed to contorted schist and gneiss, making their original parentage almost unrecognizable. Radiometric dating gives an age of 1700 million years for the metamorphism, placing it in the early part of the Proterozoic eon.|$|E
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b> The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E

25|$|When a rock {{crystallizes}} from melt (magma or lava), {{it is an}} <b>igneous</b> <b>rock.</b> This rock can be weathered and eroded, then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. It {{can then}} {{be turned into a}} metamorphic rock by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric. All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an <b>igneous</b> <b>rock</b> may once more crystallize.|$|R

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer grained granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E

5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (<b>igneous</b> <b>rocks)</b> inside older calderas. During the past 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks</b> also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{geologic}} formations and deposits {{range in}} age from several billion to several thousand years, and the age of the rocks generally decreases as one moves from west to east across the state. The oldest geologic formations in the state were created over two billion years ago during the Precambrian, and consist of metamorphic and <b>igneous</b> <b>rocks.</b> These form the central core of the Black Hills, but they can also be found in two isolated locations in eastern South Dakota near Milbank and Sioux Falls. Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills; these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.|$|E
