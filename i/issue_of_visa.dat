40|$|This article {{addresses}} the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> liberalisation between Russia and the European Union, which constitutes a key {{aspect of the}} parties’ diplomatic cooperation. This work sets out to identify the main results of Russia/EU cooperation. The authors have conducted a brief historical analysis of this area of relations. The visa “regionalisation” is considered {{in the context of}} identifying the key actors of the EU — Russia negotiations: the Kaliningrad region, Germany, Poland, and Lithuania. In their analysis, the authors rely mostly on primary sources: intergovernmental agreements on simplified border traffic, border-crossing statistics for the Kaliningrad region in the framework of the local border traffic, expert interviews, and related analytic reports. Specifically, local border traffic is viewed as the most effective form of interaction in the field of visa regime simplification and border territory development. An assessment of the positions of key negotiators shows that local border traffic between the Kaliningrad region of Russia and the Polish border voivodeships is a success, which stresses the need for a prompt transition to a visa-free regime with the EU. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> regime between the EU and Russia and its {{influence}} on relations between the partners. The visa regime prevents the smooth development of relations  between the EU and Russia and its existence seems abnormal in {{the conditions of the}} proclaimed Strategic Partnership between the partners. The author of the thesis argues that the visa regime between the EU and Russia is a consequence of securitization of certain threats on the territory of Russia by the EU media. The media are creating a fruitful background for securitization of Russian crime, poor public health situation, human trafficking problems and threat of terrorism, thereby justifying the use of extraordinary measures against these threats. The media discourse then turns into an official discourse where the problematic issues on the territory of Russia are finally securitized and named as threats. In consequence, visa regime with Russia seems to be a natural protective tool from the existential threats from its territory. This process shows that the EU is viewing Russia as a threat, using the old model of attitude towards Russia - as a dangerous neighbour. Certainly such practices contradict with the declarations of Strategic Partnership. The author suggests that for true Strategic Partnership the EU needs to change the model through which it perceives of Russia. Russia should not be seen as a threat, but as an equal partner. The methodology of the research is based on the analysis of European media discourse, where the roots of fear of Russian threats (the roots of securitization) can be traced. The methodology is the Theory of speech acts and Rhetoric Analysis...|$|E

The book has drawn the public attention and provoked criticism regarding its positive and negative impacts from readers in China and overseas. This paper, however, does not take side in agreeing or disagreeing these criticism, but analyzes how the book has achieved or failed to achieve its persuasive effect {{in the use of}} rhetoric. The theoretical framework I have chosen for this analysis is Kennedy Burke's theories of dramatism and form. I. About the Book China Can Say No was authored by five young college educated "intellectuals " who hold professions of reporter, poet, and free-lance journalist. When the book was first published in May of 1996, 50, 000 copies were sold out instantly, within one month, 10, 000 copies were sold in China. The book was written in response to the accumulated tension in Sino-American relations that had been deteriorating since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The U. S has imposed certain sanctions against China and charged China with violation of human rights and the violation of the "intellectual property " right. Moreover, {{after the collapse of the}} Berlin wall and the former Soviet Union, which brought an end to the cold war, some U. S officials and media advocated a theory of "China threat " and further justified the necessity of sanctions against China (Krauthammer 1995; Lilley 1997). In the midst of all these humiliation and charges by the U. S, the Chinese government was even more infuriated by the U. S. government's <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> to Taiwan's President Li Denghui and American's vote against China becoming a member of World Trade Organization, and hosting Olympic Games in the year 2000 in Beijing.
