50|$|The area {{now known}} as Forest Hills was named for the late 19th century home of David D.

It was a large Victorian mansion called Forest Hill and had a {{commanding}} view of the Cullowhee Valley. Later, the area became known as the Cox <b>Farm.</b> <b>Forest</b> Hill was later demolished in the 1980s, very soon after the area began being developed as Forest Hills. The current development of the neighborhood started in the 1980s. Formerly, the Forest Hills Country Club occupied a large swath of land in the village, which currently is blighted and vacant. A motor lodge that also has apartments rented to students stands just above the middle of the golf course.|$|E
