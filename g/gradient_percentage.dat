40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{discusses}} {{the safety of}} motorway tunnels in the Netherlands. Broadly speaking, it is not certain whether crashes in the Netherlands are relatively more frequent in tunnels than on open road stretches. However, there are certain factors that increase the risk in tunnels, such as {{the proximity of the}} tunnel wall, limited sight distance, merging or exit lanes in or near the tunnel and great differences in lighting at the entrance and exit. Road safety in tunnels can be improved by creating emergency lanes which increase the distance to the tunnel wall, by limiting the <b>gradient</b> <b>percentage,</b> thus minimizing speed differences (separate lanes for heavy traffic are an alternative), and creating wide layouts in horizontal bends where these cannot be avoided. In addition, tunnel entrances and exits must be carefully designed: the lighting must be of a high quality, and, if there are no emergency lanes, exit lanes and weaving sections should be avoided {{in the vicinity of the}} tunnel as well as inside the tunnel. Furthermore, tunnels should be equipped with high-quality outlet systems for fluids...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch Department of Public Works started {{construction}} of the Second Heinenoord Tunnel {{in the autumn of}} 1996. It was decided to bore two tunnels immediately next to one another. Both tunnels are designed for two-way traffic. One tunnel handles agricultural vehicles. The other handles the remaining slow traffic. For this second group of road users, the <b>gradient</b> <b>percentage</b> on the tunnel approaches is so steep that the tunnel tube intended for these road users will have an escalator and an elevator at either end. Without providing additional provisions, however, it cannot be ruled out that some moped and bicycle riders will want to avoid the delay associated with the escalator or elevator and will thus make improper use of the tunnel meant to handle agricultural vehicles. To prevent this from happening, the road authority is imposing a prohibition banning moped and bicycle riders from using the tunnel meant for agricultural vehicles. Whether this measure will be enough, however, is doubtful. In this report recommendations are given about measures and provisions to encourage, and to preferably guarantee, effective and safe observance of the measure. A distinction is made between infrastructural provisions described in great detail and non-infrastructural measures such as educational and public information activities, and police supervision...|$|E
40|$|Erosion on roadcuts is {{a concern}} due to the {{potential}} of causing environmental degradation, which has significant economic costs. It is therefore critical to {{understand the relationship between}} roadcut characteristics and soil erosion for designing roadcuts that are less vulnerable to erosion and to help road rehabilitation works. This study investigated the characteristics (i. e. <b>gradient,</b> length, <b>percentage</b> of vegetation cover and soil texture) of degraded (i. e. with rills) and non-degraded roadcuts (i. e. without rills) and explored the relationship of the roadcut characteristics with the dimensions (widths and depths) of the rills. Degraded roadcuts were steep (52. 21 °), long (10. 70 m) and had a low percentage of vegetation cover (24. 12) when compared to non-degraded roadcuts which had a gradient of 28. 24 °, length of 6. 38 m and 91. 7 % of vegetation cover. Moreover, the <b>gradient</b> and <b>percentage</b> of vegetation cover of the roadcut significantly determine the rill dimensions. The widths and depths of the rills increase with the increase in slope gradient and decrease with an increase in percentage of vegetation cover. Moreover, the widths and depths of the rills decreased downslope of the roadcuts. Based on these results, re-vegetation of roadcuts as well as construction of gentle gradients could minimise rill erosion and hence the negative on-site and off-site effects...|$|R

Twenty-one infertility patients (leukocytospermia; n 5 8; nonleukocytospermia, n 5 13) and 9 healthy donors were included. Standard semen analysis and density gradient centrifugation were performed to test NBT staining, ROS, and total antioxidant capacity.

Nevertheless, because of the higher overall concentration of polyoma DNA molecules in the mature region, nearly as many replicating DNA molecules were computed {{to be in the}} mature region as in the replicative intermediate region. The replicating molecules in the mature region was predominantly early replicative intermediates. Almost all late replicative intermediates were found in the replicative intermediate region.

In the present study, a new method using a short sub- 2 μm column, {{which can be used}} on a classical HPLC system, was developed. The new LC conditions (without chloroform) were optimised by means of a new methodology based on design of experiments in order to obtain an optimal separation.

However, the individual outcome {{can not be}} predicted by these parameters due to a considerable overlap between survivors and nonsurvivors. We prospectively investigated a PCP severity score, which has been developed earlier based on a retrospective analysis. Seven of 94 consecutively examined HIV-infected patients died within 14 days after diagnosis of PCP. A PCP severity score greater than 7 had a positive predictive value for early fatal outcome of 66. 7 percent (6 / 9) and a negative predictive value of 98. 8 percent (84 / 85). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 95. 7 percent (90 / 94).

Sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with either human IgG- 1, IgG- 2, IgG- 3 or IgG- 4 myeloma proteins formed rosettes with human neutrophils and eosinophils. Proportionally more (1 1 / 2 - 2 times) rosettes were observed with neutrophils compared to eosinophils. In contrast, E-IgE bound to eosinophils (but not to neutrophils) {{to a degree that}} was comparable to E-IgG- 1. Although IgG and IgE rosettes were inhibited by aggregates prepared from their corresponding myeloma protein {{there was no evidence that}} eosinophils and neutrophils have distinct receptors for IgG subclasses. Cells from four patients with hypereosinophilia were separated on density (metrizamide) <b>gradients.</b> The <b>percentages</b> of E-IgG- 1 and E-IgE rosettes with normal- and light-density eosinophils were similar. Neutrophils, but not eosinophils, also bound significantly more E-IgA- 1 and E-IgA- 2 than the E-human albumin (E-Alb) control. In contrast, neutrophil and eosinophil rosette formation with E-IgM and E-IgD was not significantly different from E-Alb or E alone. These experiments indicate that human neutrophils and eosinophils bind homologous IgG subclass myeloma proteins, eosinophils, but not neutrophils, bind E-IgE with a similar avidity to that observed with E-IgG 1, neutrophils, but not eosinophils, readily express demonstrable receptors for IgA- 1 and IgA- 2 and neither neutrophils nor eosinophils form E-IgM or E-IgD rosettes in greater numbers than the E-Alb controls...|$|R

Different propagation models in the literature are examined as case studies and comparisons are made. Rec. ITU-R P. 530 Model is analyzed in detail. The worst month link availability is investigated for terrestrial microwave LOS/NLOS radio links operating in NATO Band 3 + (1350 - 2690 MHz) and NATO Band 4 (4400 - 5000 MHz) frequency bands. The calculation of Bullington model of diffraction loss is extended for LOS path case and determination of reflection points on the terrain profile is improved. Several terrestrial microwave LOS/NLOS radio links are analyzed using the propagation parameters such as TX (transmitter) and RX (receiver) station coordinates, path length, frequency, antenna heights above ground level, antenna gains, polarization, radio refractivity <b>gradient,</b> time <b>percentage,</b> target SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio), bandwidth, digital terrain elevation and climate data.

The objective was to develop a mathematical model capable of evaluating the hemodynamic performance following the AVB surgery. A mathematical model that captures the interaction between LV, AS, arterial system, and AVB was developed. This model uses a limited number of parameters that all can be non-invasively measured using patient data. The model was validated using in vivo data from the literature. The model was used to determine the effect of different AVB and AS configurations on flow proportion and pressure of the aortic valve and the AVB. Results showed that the AVB leads to a significant reduction in transvalvular pressure <b>gradient.</b> The <b>percentage</b> of flow through the AVB can range from 55. 47 % to 69. 43 % following AVB with a severe AS. LV stroke work was also significantly reduced following the AVB surgery and reached a value of around 1. 2 J for several AS severities. Findings of this study suggest: 1) the AVB leads to a significant reduction in transvalvular pressure gradients; 2) flow distribution between the AS and the AVB is significantly affected by the conduit valve size; 3) the AVB leads to a significant reduction in LV stroke work; and 4) hemodynamic performance variations can be estimated using the model.

Although diatoms are typically used to assess stress from eutrophication, as fine sediment {{has the potential to}} impact diatoms in many ways, {{it is not surprising that}} an index based on benthic diatom assemblages has been proposed: the relative abundance of motile species. This measure is based on the fact that many raphid diatom species are capable of migrating through deposited sediment to avoid negative impacts. However, the use of such an index has yet to be fully tested. Various data analysis techniques were used to explore how indices based on diatom assemblages (related to eutrophication and siltation), diatom species, the traits motility, and nutrient affinity responded to a <b>gradient</b> of <b>percentage</b> cover of fine sediment. Although diatom species showed marked variation in their affinity for percentage cover of fine sediment, the relationship between motility (both percent motile and the trait motility) and deposited fine sediment is not sufficiently strong to be used as a reliable indicator of fine sediment stress. We present an approach, which could potentially be used to develop a new index (diatom indicator of sediment conditions) on the basis of the response of diatoms to fine sediment, but caution that this index requires further development before use. Despite the hydromorphology having considerable potential to affect benthic diatoms, existing indices designed to assess eutrophication were robust to hydromorphological modification, reducing the possibility of false diagnosis of impacts...|$|R

40|$|Cloud forests {{represent}} a minor {{portion of the}} world forests, though outstanding in terms of biodiversity, endemisms, and environmental services provided. Understanding the factors that drive the regeneration and species composition of these forests, and in particular how light availability affects the patterns of juvenile tree distribution in the understory, is critical for conservation and restoration programs. In this study, we determined the range-size and overlap of the abundance distribution of juveniles for 20 tree species in an Andean tropical cloud forest in Venezuela along a <b>gradient</b> of <b>percentage</b> canopy openness (%CO) used as a surrogate of light availability. The observed distribution of %CO was then compared with a bounded null model of community structure {{in order to test}} light partitioning as a driver of tree species’ coexistence. We measured %CO using hemispherical photography and the abundance and size of juvenile trees in 280 plots of 1 -m radius spread over a 32 ha forest area. The distribution of sites was skewed towards {{the lower end of the}} %CO gradient (0. 5 to 12. 8 %), while species abundance sharply diminished at both ends of the gradient. Nevertheless, 15 out of 20 species had a non-random distribution in relation to %CO, with many species concentrated near the lower side of the gradient. The observed pattern of species’ overlap was within the 95 % confidence limits for the average overlap expected under the bounded null model. These patterns indicate that low canopy openness is the rule in this forest, in spite of the scattered tree-fall gaps, and suggest that light partitioning does not determine the tree community structure at the juvenile stage. High redundancy in light requirements among juveniles of tree species may have a positive effect on species coexistence in cloud forests, thus maintaining a high species diversity. However, other factors such as recruitment limitation and differential growth/carbon-gain among species at the juvenile stage along the light gradient could contribute to the high diversity of these ecosystems. e 1 - e 7 anaq@ula. veteresas@ula. vecgarcia@ula. v...|$|R

Variations in the timing of growth releases among clustered stands corresponded well to aerial survey data indicating the timing of beetle outbreaks in the study area. Redundancy {{analysis was used to}} determine how variations in the timing and magnitude of growth releases attributed to beetle outbreaks changed with variations in climate or stand conditions over the study area.

Because pressure recovery is influenced by orifice geometry, it might manifest differently with various valve prostheses. If true, then the reliability of Doppler echocardiography for the estimation of aortic valve gradients might be different with different prostheses. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to test, in an in vitro setting, the degree to which pressure recovery results in Doppler overestimation of gradients for three commonly used aortic valve prostheses. MethodsCarpentier Edwards Perimount, Medtronic Mosaic, and St. Jude Medical bileaflet prostheses were tested under various flow conditions in a pulsatile mock flow loop with a normal aorta size. Mean pressure gradient was assessed with transducers 1 cm and 10 cm distal to the valve and with Doppler echocardiography. Pressure recovery was defined as the difference between the Doppler gradient and a 10 -cm <b>gradient.</b> The <b>percentage</b> of the maximum pressure gradient composed of pressure recovery and the percentage of pressure recovery complete 1 cm distal to the valve were calculated. ResultsThere was substantial pressure recovery for all valves in all flow states. Pressure recovery was responsible for 50 % or more of the Doppler gradients for almost all conditions and was more than 70 % complete within 1 cm for almost all conditions. Multivariate analysis found that flow and valve area (but not valve type) were predictors of pressure recovery; that flow was the major predictor of the <b>percentage</b> of Doppler <b>gradient</b> composed of pressure recovery (with minor contributions from the aorta size and prosthesis type); and that valve type and aorta size were the major predictors of the percentage of pressure recovery complete at 1 cm. ConclusionsIn an in vitro model with a normal aorta size, substantial pressure recovery occurred with all three aortic valve prostheses. Although statistically significant differences were found between valve types in the percentage of pressure recovery and percentage of pressure recovery complete at 1 cm, the differences were small and clinically unimportant. Clinically, among patients with an ascending aorta diameter less than 3. 0 cm, Doppler echocardiography likely substantially overestimates aortic valve mean gradient, regardless of prosthesis type...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{classify}} the trophic state of detritus sink systems, {{instead of the}} conventional indicators based on inorganic nutrient availability and algal biomass and productivity in the water column, we used new biochemical descriptors based {{on the amount of}} sedimentary organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) potentially available to heterotrophs. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in microphytobenthic biomass, organic matter biochemical composition, and enzymatically hydrolyzable protein and carbohydrate pools along a north-south transect in the Marsala lagoon (Mediterranean Sea, Italy) at three stations characterized by different hydrodynamic conditions and organic matter content in the sediment. In the Marsala lagoon water currents decreased from north to south and this pattern was reflected by organic matter distribution and composition. Sediment organic matter concentrations were among the highest reported in the literature and, in the central area where large meadows of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica were present, display a strong dominance of highly refractory carbohydrates. The protein to carbohydrate ratio was always < 1, indicating the dominance of aged organic detritus. Microphytobenthic biomass displayed an increasing pattern southward, and its contribution to the biopolymeric C pools ranged from negligible in the central sector of the lagoon to 50 % in its northern part, indicating that sources of sediment organic C also changed along the hydrodynamic <b>gradient.</b> The <b>percentage</b> contribution of the enzymatically hydrolyzable fraction of proteins and carbohydrates was inversely related to total protein and total carbohydrate concentrations, respectively, suggesting that bioavailability of organic C and N increased with decreasing organic matter content in the sediment and with increasing hydrodynamic regime. Microphytobenthic contribution to biopolymeric C (as a proxy of autotrophic organic C) and the ratio of the enzymatically digestible fraction to biopolymeric C (as an indicator of organic matter liability) were significantly correlated, suggesting that chlorophyll a sediment content might be used as an indicator of food promptly available to consumers. The present study also highlighted that the ratio of labile (i. e., enzymatically digestible) versus biopolymeric organic C in the sediments tends to decrease with increasing organic matter content, due to the increase of the refractory fraction of organic C. © 2003 Estuarine Research Federation...|$|R

Tree regeneration in these sites was shown to be sparse or completely lacking (< 0. 3 seedlings m(- 2)) compared with 7. 2 seedlings m(- 2) in adjacent forests. Colonization of shade-intolerant, pioneer trees may be reduced underneath Baccharis due to crown shading {{and on top of}} Sphagnum cushions, because of unfavorable conditions for tree establishment, including low pH and soil water saturation. We evaluated differences in germination rates among pioneer tree species grown in an experimental soil moisture <b>gradient.</b> Seed germination <b>percentage</b> was low for Drimys winteri and Nothofagus nitida unrelated to humidity conditions but differed between substrates (moss vs. soil).

Even though survivorship of Embothrium and Drimys under Baccharis was < 40 %, in one of the study sites, there were no differences between treatments.

However, the presence of Sphagnum cushions favors Embothrium establishment, and thus may facilitate restoration of these sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristics}} of suffusion and its mechanical consequences on saturated cohesionless soil with different initial fines contents at various stress states {{are presented in}} this paper. A series of seepage tests is performed by constant-flow-rate control mode with the measurement of the induced pore water pressure difference between {{the top and bottom}} of the tested specimen under the isotropic confining pressure. Back pressure is maintained constant in the tested soil specimen to ensure fully saturated soil condition. Cumulative eroded soil mass is continuously recorded by a consecutive monitoring system. Suffusion induced axial strain and radial strain of the 70 mm-in-diameter and 150 mm-in-height specimen is recorded during the seepage tests. The gap-graded cohesionless soil, which are assessed as internally unstable by existing evaluation methods, are tested. The mechanism of suffusion is demonstrated by the variation of hydraulic <b>gradient,</b> hydraulic conductivity, <b>percentage</b> of cumulative fines loss and volumetric strain during suffusion. The parametric study on the influence of two variables, effective stress level and initial fines content, on the mechanism of suffusion is elaborated. The mechanical consequences of suffusion are evaluated by conducting monotonic drained compression tests on the eroded specimens. Companion specimens without suffusion are tested for comparison purpose. The test results reveal that with the progress of suffusion, hydraulic gradient would drop and hydraulic conductivity would increase. Large amounts of fines are eroded away and correspondingly, contractive volumetric strain occurs. The larger effective confining pressure would lead to the less extent of suffusion. With larger initial fines content, more fines would be eroded away. The monotonic compression tests indicate that suffusion would cause the reduction of the soil strength at the major stage of drained shearing...|$|R

In the 21 biopsies from clinically normal pregnancies at term, 100 % of the decidual spiral arteries and 76 % of the myometrial arteries showed trophoblast invasion. In the 24 biopsies from women with severe pre-eclampsia, trophoblast invasion was seen in 44 % and 18 % of the decidual and myometrial segments, respectively. Endovascular trophoblast invasion was complete, partial or isolated. A variety of morphological features was present not only in different spiral arteries from the same biopsy but also in different segments of the same artery. The vascular change most commonly associated with normal pregnancies was physiological change and subintimal thickening of both segments of the spiral arteries. In pre-eclampsia medial disorganisation and hyperplasia in the myometrial arteries and acute atherosis in decidual arteries were common. CONCLUSION: Endovascular trophoblast did not show an all or none invasive phenomenon in normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancies. More decidual than myometrial arteries were invaded in both groups of patients, {{and there was a}} <b>gradient</b> in the <b>percentage</b> of decidual and myometrial arteries invaded from normal pregnancy to pre-eclampsia. Morphological features in one spiral artery may not necessarily be representative of all of those in a placental bed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Urbanization is {{a global}} {{phenomenon}} that is encroaching on natural habitats and decreasing biodiversity, although it is creating new habitats for some species. The Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) is frequently associated with urbanized landscapes but {{it is unclear what}} lies behind the high densities of kestrels in the urban environment. Results: Occupied nest sites in the city of Vienna, Austria were investigated along a <b>gradient</b> of urbanization (<b>percentage</b> of land covered by buildings or used by traffic). Field surveys determined the abundance of potential prey (birds and rodents) and the results were compared to the birds’ diets. A number of breeding parameters were recorded over the course of three years. The majority of kestrels breed in semi-natural cavities in historic buildings. Nearest neighbour distances (NND) were smallest and reproductive success lowest in the city centre. Abundance of potential prey was not found to relate to the degree of urbanization but there was a significant shift in the birds’ diets from a heavy reliance on rodents in {{the outskirts of the city}} to feeding more on small birds in the centre. The use of urban habitats was associated with higher nest failure, partly associated with predation and nest desertion, and with significantly lower hatching rates and smaller fledged broods. Conclusions: High breeding densities in urban habitats do not necessarily correlate with high habitat quality. The high density of kestrel nests in the city centre is probably due to the ready availability of breeding cavities. Highly urbanized areas in Vienna are associated with unexpected costs for the city dwelling-raptor, in terms both of prey availability and of reproductive success. The kestrel appears to be exploiting the urban environment but given the poor reproductive performance of urban kestrels it is likely that the species is falling into an ecological trap...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. Streams of the Flint River Basin (FRB) {{remain as}} viable habitat for many {{freshwater}} species and harbor {{some of the}} most diverse mussel assemblages in the Southeast. However, land use changes, hydrologic alterations, and declines in native fish species have adversely affected mussel diversity and abundance throughout the region. Protection of rare and sensitive mussels requires the development of timely conservation strategies, supported by knowledge of current riparian and instream habitat conditions that impact their survival and recovery. We examined habitat conditions and selected water quality parameters at 81 stream sites that have historically supported populations of freshwater mussel species in the Basin. Higher nutrient, sediment, and bacterial concentrations were observed in the upper portion (Piedmont) of the Basin, which is characterized by higher <b>gradient</b> streams and <b>percentages</b> of urban land use. Sites in the lower section of the Basin (Fall Line Hills and Coastal Plain) maintained better quality riparian habitat including a larger buffer zone width, greater bank stability, and more vegetative cover. Overall, mussel habitat quality appeared good throughout the Basin. Physicochemical parameters and riparian habitat quality were influenced both by regional geologic differences and patterns of human activity. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

Estos sitios son dominados por arbustos de Baccharis patagonica, musgos en cojín del género Sphagnum, plantas palustres y helechos. En estos sitios hemos registrado escasa o nula colonización arbórea (Successional shrublands {{created by}} clearcutting and burning of forests are {{frequent}} in Chiloé Island and surrounding mainland in southern Chile. These areas {{are characterized by}} seasonally waterlogged soils, and vegetation dominated by sedges, ferns and shrubs, such as Baccharis patagonica, with thick carpets of Sphagnum moss occupying the spaces between shrubs. Tree regeneration in these sites was shown to be sparse or completely lacking (< 0. 3 seedlings m- 2) compared with 7. 2 seedlings m- 2 in adjacent forests. Colonization of shade-intolerant, pioneer trees may be reduced underneath Baccharis due to crown shading {{and on top of}} Sphagnum cushions, because of unfavorable conditions for tree establishment, including low pH and soil water saturation. We evaluated differences in germination rates among pioneer tree species grown in an experimental soil moisture <b>gradient.</b> Seed germination <b>percentage</b> was low for Drimys winteri and Nothofagus nitida unrelated to humidity conditions but differed between substrates (moss vs. soil). Embothrium had higher germination and survivorship when growing on Sphagnum cushions. We also monitored seedling survival of two pioneer tree species (Embothrium coccineum and Drimys winteri) transplanted directly under Baccharis shrubs, in open areas, or on moss patches. Even though survivorship of Embothrium and Drimys under Baccharis was < 40 %, in one of the study sites, there were no differences between treatments. Waterlogged soils would constraint tree regeneration on successional shrublands {{due to a lack of}} elevated substrates. However, the presence of Sphagnum cushions favors Embothrium establishment, and thus may facilitate restoration of these site...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} dose distributions in partial-volume irradiation {{experiments in}} small experimental animals, {{in particular the}} parotid gland of rat. Materials and methods: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging images were made that provided {{the outlines of the}} parotid glands, which were used to design collimators with conformal radiation ports for 100 and 50 % cranial/caudal partial-volume irradiation. A protocol for absolute dosimetry was designed and relative dose measurements were performed. From the three-dimensional topographical data and the three-dimensional dose distribution, dose-volume histograms were determined. Results: The standard uncertainty of absorbed entrance dose was within 3 %. Radiochromic film, thermoluminescence dosemeters and ionization chamber dose measurements revealed that the relative doses measured were in good agreement. The 20 - 80 % penumbra of the beam across the 50 % field edge was only 0. 4 mm at a 6 mm depth. The <b>gradient</b> of the <b>percentage</b> depth dose from the skin of the rat to a depth of 12 mm was 1. 5 % mm(- 1). The absorbed doses in the cranial 50 % and the caudal 50 % partial volumes were comparable. This finding was reflected in the calculated dose-volume histograms of the different regions, which were similar. The dose in the shielded area between the left and right ports was about 14 % of the dose near the centres of the beams. Conclusion: The designed set-up showed that irradiation of small volumes could be performed with high accuracy allowing the study of differences in radiation damage. Similar doses were given to the 50 % cranial and 50 % caudal gland volumes and, therefore, a possible difference in radiosensitivity in these volumes was not a dose effect. The approach used was also applicable for the irradiation of small volumes of other tissues...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Infertility being {{a burning}} issue, the male itself {{contributes}} about 40 % as a cause, as evident by statistical data. However, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) {{has emerged as}} a powerful tool in the management of infertility. Sperm preparation techniques govern the selection procedure to separate functional spermatozoa which can then be used in IUI, IVF, and ART and for cryopreservation. AIM: The present study was aimed at evaluation of sperm preparation techniques for reliability, performance and to determine the most effective, feasible and economical technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects under study includes males with normal proven fertility (n= 40) and the males with unexplained infertility (n= 40). Four sperm separation techniques, viz., Swim-up, Swim-down, Sucrose and Ficoll- 400 density gradient techniques were evaluated for their efficacy in separation of good quality fraction of spermatozoa. Sperm viability, morphology and maturation status of spermatozoa were taken as evaluation parameters following the standard methods (WHO 2010). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data was analyzed using student′s t-test and the four selected techniques were compared with the normal semen samples for scoring the efficiency of the techniques. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Out of the several techniques used, Ficoll- 400 was found to be more efficient method for separation of spermatozoa. The percentage of change in each parameter was calculated and taken as the index for recovery of potent sperm from the original sperm. Ficoll- 400 density <b>gradient</b> yielded higher <b>percentage</b> of live, mature, morphologically normal spermatozoa in an isolated fraction as compared to other three techniques. CONCLUSION: It was observed that a combination of Ficoll- 400 gradient separation with Swim-up technique could give "quality" spermatozoa which in-turn would directly {{have an impact on the}} success of IVF and other ART techniques...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It {{has been}} shown that {{patients}} with a first ischemic stroke are at high risk of developing recurrent stroke due to carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture. However, no one has defined the difference in plaques between initial and recurrent stroke. This study sought to investigate the characteristics of carotid plaque between patients with first-time and recurrent acute ischemic stroke by using MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with recent acute ischemic stroke were recruited. All subjects underwent carotid high-resolution black-blood MR imaging. The index carotid arteries, defined as the arteries responsible for the ipsilateral stroke, were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Carotid plaque burden and compositional features between patients with first-time and recurrent ischemic stroke were compared. RESULTS: Of 89 recruited patients, 51 had first-time stroke and 38 had recurrent stroke. The mean WA, WT, and PWV were greater in patients with recurrent stroke than in patients with first-time stroke (all, P. 05). Compared with patients with first-time stroke, those with recurrent stroke showed significantly higher prevalence of calcification (44. 7 % versus 23. 5 %, P. 035) as well as a larger volume of LRNC (179. 14 254. 81 mm 2 versus 71. 65 111. 15 mm 2, P. 027). IPH or fibrous cap rupture or both were observed in 15. 8 % of patients with recurrent stroke and 3. 9 % of patients with first-time stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaques in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke are significantly aggravated compared with those in patients with first-time stroke, and monitoring carotid plaques in patients with initial stroke by MR imaging may be helpful for secondary stroke prevention.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] To compare the effects of 1 % and 2 % propofol on the maximum and average lipid levels, the relative frequency of hyperlipidaemia, the propofol dose required to achieve an equivalent degree of sedation, the pharmacodynamie effects at the required infusion rates, and the effect on respiratory function. Design. Open, randomised, parallel group, multicentre comparison study. Setting. Intensive care units (ICUs) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Stellenbosch and at Vergelen Medicity, Somerset West. Subjects. Patients who were artificially ventilated for at least 72 hours in the ICUs and who required sedation or analgesia. Outcome measures. Continuous intravenous infusion of 1 % or 2 % propofol to provide an administration rate {{in the range of}} 1 - 4 mg/kg/h. The initial infusion rate was about 2 mg/kg/h, adjusted to achieve the appropriate level of sedation. Results and conclusions. Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the study, of which 72 were evaluable for safety analysis and 58 were evaluable for efficacy analysis. The total daily dose of propofol (ml/day) in the 2 % propofol group was about 60 % of that in the 1 % propofol group, indicating that the lipid load in the 2 % propofol group had only slightly more than half the lipid load in the 1 % propofol group. Thirteen of 27 patients (48 %) int 2 % propofol group had abnormally high triglyceride levels compared with 19 of 31 patients (61 %) in the 1 % propofol group. Similarly, 1 of 22 patients (4 %) in the 2 % propofol group had lipaemia compared with 4 of 30 patients (13 %) in the 1 % propofol group. Abnormal cholesterollevels, alveolar-arterial oxygen tension <b>gradient</b> and daily <b>percentage</b> of time with desired sedation were comparable between the two groups. The observed incidence of raised plasma triglyceride concentrations, and of lipaemia, was lower in the 2 % propofol group than in the 1 % propofol group, although the differences were not statistically significant. The 2 % formulation of propofol appears to be as effective and at least as safe as 1 % propofol. Publisher’s versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of osmotic {{conditions on the}} gradient of capillary permeability disclosed by the distribution into mammalian muscle of vital dyes has been tested experimentally. The percentage of circulating blood proteins was increased in rabbits by the injection of compatible plasma, or of compatible serum concentrate obtained {{by means of a}} new method of ultrafiltration which has proved both rapid and effective. It was found that when this had been done and the circulatory conditions had stabilized themselves, the gradient of capillary permeability still existed, though its effective extent was less than under normal circumstances. When the percentage of circulating blood proteins was reduced, on the other hand, by repeated bleedings with return of the cells, either as such or suspended in the protein-free fluid obtained by dialysis of serum, the extent of the gradient of capillary permeability was broadened and dye passed out into the tissue more readily than usual from the capillary as a whole. In contrast to these findings injection of a very hypertonic dextrose solution during the period when dye was escaping had no perceptible effect on the gradient of capillary permeability. The observed phenomena cannot be explained by a flow of dye-stained fluid into or out of the blood vessels. The gradient of capillary permeability exists independently of osmotic conditions, though its extent can be markedly influenced by altering the amount of circulating blood proteins. A considerable proportion of the dye used to study the gradient is adsorbed upon these proteins, as subsidiary experiments have shown. This happening provides a sufficient cause for the differences observed in the extent of the <b>gradient</b> when the <b>percentage</b> of proteins is increased or diminished. The evidence like that of previous papers indicates that the cause for the gradient {{is to be found in}} a structural differentiation along the capillary, such that the barrier offered by its wall progressively diminishes on the way to the venule. Most current estimates of the effective osmotic pressure of the blood proteins fail to take into account the existence of local differences in permeability along the capillary...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the economy, the sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission from China since 2000 is of increasing concern. In this study, we estimate the annual SO 2 emission in China after 2000 using a technology-based methodology specifically for China. From 2000 to 2006, total SO 2 emission in China increased by 53 %, from 21. 7 Tg to 33. 2 Tg, at an annual growth rate of 7. 3 %. Emissions from power plants are the main sources of SO 2 in China and they increased from 10. 6 Tg to 18. 6 Tg in the same period. Geographically, emission from north China increased by 85 %, whereas that from the south increased by only 28 %. The emission growth rate slowed around 2005, and emissions began to decrease after 2006 mainly due to the wide application of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) devices in power plants {{in response to a}} new policy of China's government. This paper shows that the trend of estimated SO 2 emission in China is consistent with the trends of SO 2 concentration and acid rain pH and frequency in China, {{as well as with the}} increasing trends of background SO 2 and sulfate concentration in East Asia. A longitudinal <b>gradient</b> in the <b>percentage</b> change of urban SO 2 concentration in Japan is found during 2000 – 2007, indicating that the decrease of urban SO 2 is lower in areas close to the Asian continent. This implies that the transport of increasing SO 2 from the Asian continent partially counteracts the local reduction of SO 2 emission downwind. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are found to be highly correlated with the surface solar radiation (SSR) measurements in East Asia. Using MODIS AOD data as a surrogate of SSR, we found that China and East Asia excluding Japan underwent a continuous dimming after 2000, which is in line with the dramatic increase in SO 2 emission in East Asia. The trends of AOD from both satellite retrievals and model over East Asia are also consistent with the trend of SO 2 emission in China, especially during the second half of the year, when sulfur contributes the largest fraction of AOD. The arrested growth in SO 2 emissions since 2006 is also reflected in the decreasing trends of SO 2 and SO 4 2 &minus; concentrations, acid rain pH values and frequencies, and AOD over East Asia...|$|R
