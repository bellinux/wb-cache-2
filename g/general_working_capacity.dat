40|$|A medical, psychological, {{and sociological}} study of 391 male {{employees}} in a Swedish {{pulp and paper}} industry was performed in 1961. Factors associated with back pain and back abnormality were investigated. Univariate analyses showed associations of back pain with occupational status, low education, duration of employment, low performance on cognitive tests, and neuroticism. Back abnormalities evaluated on the basis of physical examination showed in principle the same associations but the strength as well as the significances were stronger. Multiple logistic regression analyses using data for manual workers showed that neuroticism and duration of employment were directly associated with back pain. The same two variables and low performance on one of the psychological tests were directly associated with back abnormalities. Age showed no direct association with back pain or back abnormalities. Strong associations between back pain and back abnormalities with both perceived health and <b>general</b> <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> and the doctor's evaluation in the same areas were demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: to {{determine}} the level of physical development and physical preparedness of weight-lifters of 10 – 12 years old. Material & Methods: boys of 10 – 12 years old, who go in for weightlifting sections in CYSS HTZ, and also in sports boarding school No 2 of Kharkiv, participated in this research. 34 boys were attracted to the experiment. Research methods: theoretical method and generalization of literature, pedagogical observation, pedagogical experiment, method of mathematical statistics. Results: differences in intensity of gain of indicators of physical development for the biennium of observations display unevenness and heterochrony of ripening of organism of children were found. The noticeable difference in intensity of gain {{of the majority of}} the studied indicators of physical development is noted even for such rather short period (two years). The increase during the whole biennium is established for absolute values of the general physical operability of the tested. However, the size of relative intensity of gain of absolute values of <b>general</b> physical <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> at stages of observations is different: the first year – 10, 48 %, the second – 0, 86 % (t= 22, 3; р< 0, 01). In other words, indicators of <b>general</b> physical <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> considerably grow for the first year of observations (10 – 11 years old), and practically do not change for the second year (11 – 12 years old). Conclusions: the established decrease in relative sizes of the <b>general</b> physical <b>working</b> <b>capacity,</b> which is noted at boys in total with the deterioration in results in run at distance of 1000 m, allowed to draw conclusion on the underdevelopment at them the major physical qualities and systems of organism, which define endurance and <b>general</b> physical <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Undoubtedly, the insufficient level of endurance and <b>general</b> physical <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> reduces adaptation opportunities of boys-weight-lifters...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present article is to present an {{overview}} of a set of studies conducted in our own laboratory on cognitive and communicative development in children with cochlear implants (CI). The results demonstrate that children with CIs perform at significantly lower levels on the majority of the cognitive tasks.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is {{a device that}} provides individuals with severe to profound hearing impairment (SPHI) with auditory stimulation, which {{makes it possible for}} them to develop skills related to spoken communication. We have little knowledge about how hearing with a CI influences cognitive and communicative development and {{there is a need for}} development of methods for assessment. The general purpose of this thesis was to explore the interaction between cognition (<b>working</b> memory <b>capacity)</b> and phonological processing and more complex skills such as the ability to interact with hearing peers, speech recognition in noise and aspects of reading and writing in children/adolescents with CI. The ability to repeat and discriminate nonwords was assessed in 26 children/adolescents with CI aged 5; 2 - 19; 1. Thirteen of these, aged 9; 0 - 19; 1 were also assessed in a set of experimental tasks regarding <b>general</b> <b>working</b> memory, speech recognition in noise and some aspects of reading and writing and participated in a referential communication task for the assessment of conversational skills. The methods used were found adequate. The children/adolescents with CI had weak phonological processing skills, but in spite of this did not differ much from controls in reading, writing and conversation, even if phonological processing seemed to be related to reading skills. However, they tended to use different strategies than peers in requesting clarification in conversation and in reading, perhaps as an adaptation to their impairment. <b>General</b> <b>working</b> memory <b>capacity</b> was associated with strategies in requesting clarification and with the construction of written narratives and thus is a further factor influencing outcome...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> after subarachnoid haemorrhage from a long-term perspective, using data from national sick leave records. In addition, factors associated with <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> were analysed. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Subjects/patients: A consecutive total sample of 38 working-age participants with first-ever subarachnoid haemorrhage was included. Working capacity of the 30 participants not on early retirement prior to the subarachnoid haemorrhage was analysed. Methods: Working capacity was defined as no longer being registered on sick leave or early retirement in the Social Insurance Agency and not being age retired or deceased. Results: Regain of <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> continued until 2. 5 years post-subarachnoid haemorrhage and 73 % of the participants were deemed to have <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Functional independence at discharge from hospital, and higher responsiveness at admittance were the main factors associated with an earlier regain of <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Conclusion: Nearly three-quarters of subjects were deemed to have <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> within 2. 5 years post-subarachnoid haemorrhage with a non-self-reported outcome.

40|$|Deaf native signers have a <b>general</b> <b>working</b> memory (WM) <b>capacity</b> {{similar to}} that of hearing non-signers but are less {{sensitive}} to the temporal order of stored items at retrieval. General WM capacity declines with age, but little is known of how cognitive aging affects WM function in deaf signers. We investigated WM function in elderly deaf signers (EDS) and an age-matched comparison group of hearing non-signers (EHN) using a paradigm designed to highlight differences in temporal and spatial processing of item and order information. EDS performed worse than EHN on both item and order recognition using a temporal style of presentation. Reanalysis together with earlier data showed that with the temporal style of presentation, order recognition performance for EDS was also lower than for young adult deaf signers. Older participants responded more slowly than younger participants. These findings suggest that apart from age-related slowing irrespective of sensory and language status, there is an age-related difference specific to deaf signers in the ability to retain order information in WM when temporal processing demands are high. This may be due to neural reorganisation arising from sign language use. Concurrent spatial information with the Mixed style of presentation resulted in enhanced order processing for all groups, suggesting that concurrent temporal and spatial cues may enhance learning for both deaf and hearing groups. These findings support and extend the WM model for Ease of Language Understanding...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{influence}} of country of birth and attained level of education, on impaired mobility and impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> adjusted for age, sex, and other background variables. SETTING: Sweden. DESIGN: A random sample of 5798 men and 6072 women ages 55 - 74 years were interviewed face to face by Statistics Sweden 1986 - 1993. Dependent variable: impaired mobility and impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Independent variables: sex, age, country of birth (Swedes, Finns, Western countries, south Europeans, and all others), attained level of education, marital status, form of tenure, and social network. This study was designed as a cross sectional study. The data were analysed with unconditional logistic regression in main effect models. The results are shown as odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: In general, poor health, defined as impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> or impaired mobility, proved to be more frequent among foreign born people and in all socially disadvantaged groups such as those with a low educational status, people renting a dwelling or with a poor social network. Impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> and impaired mobility were more frequent among female "all others". The impaired mobility among men and women born in south Europe was high with OR = 2. 65 (CI = 1. 34, 5. 25) and OR = 3. 17 (CI = 1. 44, 7. 00) in the full model. Men and women from Finland and all other countries had high risks for impaired mobility when adjusted for all background variables. Finnish men and south European women had the highest odds ratios for impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> There was a clear gradient between educational status and impaired <b>working</b> <b>capacity,</b> with the highest odds ratios for men and women, 2. 39 and 1. 92, with a low attained level of education, when adjusting for the independent variables.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} cost {{of public}} social sickness insurance poses a serious economic {{threat to the}} Swedish welfare state. In recent years, expenditures for social insurance in general, {{as well as social}} sickness insurance in particular, have risen steeply in Sweden. This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between sickness absence (SA) and self-reported reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> due to a longstanding illness (> 3 months), as well between SA {{and a number of other}} health problems. Methods Self-reported data on longstanding illness and resultant reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity,</b> socioeconomic factors, <b>working</b> environment, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety, and general health were obtained for 22, 281 employed (paid) persons aged 25 to 64 years. These data were retrieved from the Swedish Living Conditions Survey for 1995 to 2002. National civic registration numbers, replaced with serial numbers to ensure anonymity, were used to link these data to individual-level SA records from the National Social Insurance Board. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio of the main outcome variable for the three levels of the SA variable (0 – 28, 29 – 90, > 90 days/year). Results There was an obvious increasing gradient in length of SA and increasing odds of reporting reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Odds ratios ranged from 3. 5 to 19. 0; i. e., those with more than ninety days of SA had 19. 0 times higher odds of reporting reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> than those with 0 – 28 days of SA a year. This very strong association changed less than 10 % after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and working environment characteristics. A total of 48. 7 % of persons on sick leave ≥ 29 days reported no longstanding illness and reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity.</b> Of these persons, about 43 % reported one or more other health problem. Conclusion We confirmed that longstanding illness that results in self-reported reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> is an important variable related to length of SA, even after taking important confounders into consideration. We found a little less than half of those on sick leave reported no reduced <b>working</b> <b>capacity</b> due to longstanding illness, and some of these reported no other health problems. However, it is possible that some respondents had health problems not captured in the survey. </p...|$|R
