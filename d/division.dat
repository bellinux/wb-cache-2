5|$|As {{far as the}} Germans were concerned, Operation Hackfleisch was a {{moderate}} success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed, but did not prevent, the Partisans' advance into Serbia. In order to allow the 7th SS <b>Division</b> to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia, both I/28 and III/28 were placed {{under the command of}} that <b>division</b> for the period of 8–17 August 1944. During the remainder of August 1944, the rump of the <b>division</b> fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone.

The <b>division</b> was reduced to 9,000 men, half of its wartime strength. To replenish the ranks of the understrength <b>division,</b> the Republic of Korea assigned over 8,600 poorly trained Korean soldiers to the <b>division.</b> The Colombian Battalion was at times attached to the <b>division.</b> With the addition of priority reinforcements from the US, the <b>division</b> was eventually increased to 25,000 when it entered combat.

5|$|Bader {{was named}} {{tactical}} {{commander of the}} combined forces (known as Kampfgruppe Bader) committed to Operation Trio, but to appease the Italians the force was formally under the overall command of the Italian Second Army, commanded by Roatta.

Since 18 February, the 718th Infantry <b>Division</b> had been responsible for an area of operations bounded by the Sava and Bosna in the north, the Drina {{to the east and}} the German-Italian demarcation line to the south. Mainly because of lack of transport and firepower, the <b>division</b> had only conducted limited offensive operations against the Partisans between mid-February and mid-April.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd <b>Division</b> {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the north–south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the <b>division</b> in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the <b>division</b> artillery in the north were separated from the <b>division</b> headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. <b>Division</b> commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided <b>division</b> as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the <b>division</b> artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S.

The 24th <b>Division</b> was at Naktong, with the 25th Infantry <b>Division</b> to the south, and the 1st Cavalry <b>Division</b> and South Korean forces to the north.

The 24th was quickly sent to block the North Korean 6th Infantry <b>Division,</b> which attempted to attack the UN forces from the southwest.

After 10 days of fighting, the 24th Infantry <b>Division</b> counterattacked and forced the North Koreans back across the river. By late August 1950, only 184 of the 34th Regiment's original 1,898 men remained. The regiment was dissolved and was replaced within the 24th by the 5th Regimental Combat Team. The 34th Regiment's survivors were added to the ranks of the 19th and 21st regiments in an effort to bring them up to strength, and the 5th Infantry remained with the 24th <b>Division</b> until the <b>division</b> withdrew from Korea. Elements of the 24th Infantry <b>Division</b> were moved into reserve on 23 August and replaced by the 2nd Infantry <b>Division.</b> A second, larger North Korean attack occurred between 31 August and 19 September, but the 2nd, 24th, and 25th infantry divisions and the 1st Cavalry <b>Division</b> beat the North Koreans back across the river again.|$|E
