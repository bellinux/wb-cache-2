Three varieties of hardened-yam flour were incorporated in wheat flour in proportions of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %[*](w/w). Samples were evaluated for protein content, Zeleny sedimentation index, <b>Hagberg</b> <b>falling</b> <b>number,</b> functional properties (WAC, WSI, and OAC), and some rheological properties including dough rupture pressure (P), extensibility (L), stability (P/L), and deformation energy (W). Results showed that trifoliate hardened-yam flours {{do not have}} acceptable baking properties as pictured by the low Zeleny sedimentation index and the low <b>Hagberg</b> <b>falling</b> <b>number.</b> Protein quality (Zeleny index, 31) of wheat flour helped to compensate gluten deficit of yam flours, but the amylasic activity determined by the <b>Hagberg</b> <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> could not be adjusted, {{which resulted in a}} loss of extensibility (L) of the paste at 10 % substitution. Multivariate analysis of experimental data regrouped wheat flour and all wheat/hardened-yam treated with kanwa composite flours in one homogeneous cluster.

WB 4458, WB Grainfield, LCS Mint, LCS Wizard, SY Monument, and T 158 wheat varieties grown in three Kansas locations were germinated with the developed small-scale germination method and <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> values were compared. Byrd, Tam 204, and T 158 were germinated with a scaled-up germination method aimed at generating samples in three <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> ranges of less than 120 seconds (low <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> and highly sprouted), 250 ± 40 seconds (medium <b>falling</b> <b>number),</b> and 350 ± 40 seconds (high <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> and low sprouting). Controls were un-germinated, sound (> 400 seconds <b>falling</b> <b>number),</b> samples of each variety. The control whole grain and sprouted wheat was ground into flour. A mixograph {{was used to determine}} dough water absorption and mixing time. Whole wheat bread was made to determine bread volume, crumb characteristics, and bread texture. Overall there were few significant differences within each wheat variety for the different levels of germination. The only significant difference observed in all three varieties was that each highly sprouted grain (< 120 seconds <b>falling</b> <b>number)</b> produced bread with significantly lower elasticity than the control within each variety, indicating that this level of germination produced a gummier bread. Elasticity was positively correlated with <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> (r=+ 0. 71). A focused analysis on the Byrd variety compared the germinated samples to samples generated with added malted barley to the same <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> ranges.

The highly and medium sprouted grain had significantly lower dough water absorption than the malted counterparts for those levels and the medium sprouted grain also had a lower mix time then the malted sample.

Each independent variable was tested at five levels: 0. 00 %, 0. 50 %, 1. 00 %, 1. 50 % and 2. 00 % (w/w, on weight of flour basis). The results showed that the Belpan Malt was the most effective additive on <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> and gluten deformation index values. The best results were obtained among the combinations between Belpan AS and Belpan Malt on the <b>falling</b> <b>number.</b> The optimum level of the formulation was found to be a mix containing 0. 80 % from each additive used in this study when desirability function method was applied...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} chemical compounds for wheat dough are gluten proteins -gliadins and glutenins {{which have the}} distinctive rheological ability to form a dough matrix that determines bread quality. Other cereal flours as rye flour do not have these unique properties, but they can improve nutritional aspects of daily consumed breads such as higher intake of fibre which has {{a positive effect on}} digestion and decreases risk of hypercholesterolemia, obesity and heart disease, and current trend in bakery is to replace part of wheat flour with rye flour. In this work 11 ratios of wheat-rye mixtures were prepared; flour quality (Zeleny sedimentation volume, <b>Hagberg</b> <b>falling</b> <b>number,</b> water absorption), machine workability of dough and consequently bread quality characteristics (bread shape, mean bread volume, dough yield, pastry yield, baking loss, texture parameters, image analysis) were investigated. The results showed that parameters of final product are significantly affected by wheat-rye ratio and flour quality. Moreover the addition of rye flour does not influence machine workability of the mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pre-maturity α-amylase (PMA) {{is a major}} cause of poor bread-making quality (low <b>Hagberg</b> <b>Falling</b> <b>Number)</b> in wheat grain. In susceptible genotypes, it involves the excessive accumulation of high isoelectric point (pI) α-amylase in mature grain prior to germination {{and in the absence of}} pre-harvest sprouting. Several factors regulate PMA formation in developing grain, including genotype, agronomy, and environmental conditions. In particular, a cold period during mid-grain development has been found to be a major stimulus for PMA induction. Although the factors affecting the PMA occurrence are well known, little is known about the molecular mechanism governing its induction. The plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) influence various aspects of grain development, and it has been suggested that PMA involves changes in the amount of these hormones or the sensitivity of the grain to these hormones. This review summarizes recent studies investigating the role of ABA and GAs in PMA induction and PMA occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Region x year {{means for}} crude protein {{concentration}} (CP) and <b>Hagberg</b> <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> (HFN) from the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) surveys were modelled using mean daily temperature, rainfall and nitrogen application. A model accounting for 78. 6 % {{of the variation}} in CP incorporated positive coefficients for mean daily temperature (25 June to 15 July), nitrogen applied to the crop, and early summer rainfall (28 May to 8 July), and a negative coefficient for spring rainfall (5 March ? 27 May). For CP there was no statistical evidence that fitting one regression for all regions was significantly worse than fitting individual lines for each of the 10 regions. A model describing 67. 1 % {{of the variation in}} HFN incorporated a negative coefficient for August rainfall and positive coefficients for mean June temperature, mean August temperature and nitrogen applied to the crop. There was statistical evidence that fitting separate lines for certain regions was justified. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Starch {{and total}} protein contents, α-amylase {{activity}} of grains {{as well as}} <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> in the flour, an internationally accepted measure of α-amylase activity in the food industry, were compared in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes which are widely used in the agriculture and breeding in Romania and Hungary. These cultivars were originated from Romania (20 cultivars), Hungary (cv. GK Elet, GK Othalom and Mv Emese), France (cv. Cappelle Desprez), the USA (cv. Plainsman) and China (cv. Xiang). The starch contents of the grains were high in those cultivars, where the protein contents were relatively low. The highest starch content among the investigated wheat genotypes {{was found in the}} Romanian Gruia cultivar, which could be characterized also with low starch degrading α-amylase activity in the grain and with a high <b>falling</b> <b>number.</b> This wheat genotype can be a good candidate for utilization in starch industry. Other genotypes, which had relatively high starch contents and, a low α-amylase activity (or high <b>falling</b> <b>number)</b> were the Romanian Crina and Gloria, the Hungarian GK Othalom, GK Elet, Mv Emese and the French Cappelle Desprez cultivars. ...|$|R
