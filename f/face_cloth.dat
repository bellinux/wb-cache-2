60|$|We {{all stood}} awed at {{the beauty of}} the figure which, save for the <b>face</b> <b>cloth,</b> now lay {{completely}} nude before us. Mr. Trelawny bent over, and with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen cloth which was of the same fineness as the robe. As he stood back and the whole glorious beauty of the Queen was revealed, I felt a rush of shame sweep over me. It was not right that we should be there, gazing with irreverent eyes on such unclad beauty: it was indecent; it was almost sacrilegious! And yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream of. It was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory by the hand of a Praxiteles. There was nothing of that horrible shrinkage which death seems to effect in a moment. There was none of the wrinkled toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of most mummies. There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in the sand, as I had seen before in museums. All the pores of the body seemed to have been preserved in some wonderful way. The flesh was full and round, as in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as satin. The colour seemed extraordinary. It was like ivory, new ivory; except where the right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist and missing hand had lain bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many tens of centuries.|$|E

5000|$|Broadcloth is a dense, plain woven cloth, {{historically}} made of wool. The defining {{characteristic of}} Broadcloth is not its finished width, {{but the fact that}} it was woven much wider (typically 50 - 75% wider than its finished width) and then heavily milled (traditionally the cloth was worked by heavy wooden trip hammers in hot soapy water in order to shrink it) in order to reduce it to the required width. The effect of the milling process is to draw the yarns much closer together than could be achieved in the loom and allow the individual fibres of the wool to bind together in a felting process.

40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{simultaneous}} use of aerogel and phase change material (PCM) on the <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> of thermal liner in firefighter&# 039;s protective garment. Aerogel {{is commonly used}} to resist incoming heat flux {{in the field of}} high heat protection and to prevent the loss of body heat in the cold environment clothing. In high heat protection clothing, aerogel not only resists the incoming heat fluxes but also blocks the outbound body heat. As a result the wearer suffers from internal increase of body temperature. Previous studies identified the potential use of aerogel in firefighter&# 039;s protective clothing. However there was no clear approach to resolve the problem associated with body heat release. Current study focuses on the problem by applying PCM along with aerogel on fabric. The ambient-side of a thermal liner <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> was coated with silica aerogel particles; meanwhile, the next to skin side was coated with PCM/aerogel composite powder. The new thermal liner revealed superior thermal protection and comfort. It extended the time to reach pain threshold and increased the pain alarm time. The Fourier transform infrared analysis of the aerogel/PCM composite powder showed the presence of PCM in nanoporous aerogel particles while the differential scanning calorimeter quantified the heat absorbing capacity of the new composite powder. Scanning electron microscope, air permeability tester, and jPOR macro of ImageJ software were used for the surface characteristics and porosity analysis of coated liner. The thermal stability of the composite powder was investigated through an infrared thermal camera.

The remaining residual is encoded as dis-placement maps at each frame giving a displacement video.

40|$|International audienceTino Sehgal {{receives}} {{carte blanche}} {{to work in}} the immense space of the Palais de Tokyo, a leading public contemporary art museum in Paris. It does not put any painting, sculpture or installation, but only moving bodies. These bodies, at the beginning indiscernible from spectators, enter into choreographies or interactions. They make a performance, and all this is performing, i. e. has an effect on the participants. Something moves in the sharing and the constitution of space, in the work / viewer bonds, in us who observe and experience. The artist affirms that what is thus performed is political. 1 / A set of performers start to move in the basement space of the Palais de Tokyo sometimes running, sometimes walking. Sometimes these bodies stop and sing words in chorus. Here they are running on the stairs. Their eyes meet our own. With one and the other, a smile. They breathe a thank you when I make room for them to climb a few steps, following what I guess being a trajectory, a line, a displacement. I feel sympathy to their effort, the exercise seems difficult, singular. I start to feel being one of them. They resemble a fish bench, an organic form that moves with accelerations and changes in direction. They seem to follow a "logic", a movement of their own of which we perceive a hidden code, not yet deciphered, or yet to be deciphered. Fascination! My body is caught in this machine, touches these movements and takes me into an aesthetic (body and feeling) experience. " Spacing ". Beyes & Steyaert (2011) calls spacing this material, embodied, affective and minor (re-) configuration of space, as a way to bring back space into critical organization theory. I can feel here this spacing, this generative production of space by bodies in motion, in their sometimes organized sometimes disorganized mundane movements. The naked space produces effects, impression, sense, thanks to the distribution of bodies whose <b>face,</b> <b>cloth,</b> shape matter far less than their geographical positions and gesture in relation to the others. We do not have bodies within space, we have bodies constituting an organizational spacing. 2 / Dialogue with performers. Plannings are to be met. You need to show your neverending commitment and enthousiasm in order to be chosen. The performance was set in London by Tino Sehgal, then passed on from professional to non-professional performers (are the latters paid, probably not, recognized or building self-recognition in taking part to the performances?). During the performances, some freedom are allowed - however some participants may intervene, arguing that ‘it should not that way', and in an authoritative manner affirm that ‘Tino would not appreciate' (an unconstestable argument). A performance is not a representation. It is not through the effectuation of the right movements at the right place and time that spacing happens, but because something actually happens in the here and now. Much is prepared and rehearsed, but the mere representation would probably fail to produce the effect. Spacing is performative because it is performed, and not merely exhibited or represented. For Beyes and Stayaert you need a non-representational theory to account for this performativity. With non-representational theory, practices are pre-individual, they are not to be tied to human subjects but stabilized, material-relational bundles of ‘all manners of resources'. The human body is seen as an outcome of and the setting for a play of connections and forces, a ‘volatile combination of flesh, fluids, organs, skeletal structure and dreams, desires, ideas, social conventions and habits' (Latham et al., 2009 : 108). Tino Sehgal may be playing with such pre-individual practices, playing with arrangement of flesh and social conventions. And such a performativity explores difference, otherness and novelty, and as such is indeed political. 3 / But how to account for such a performativity, for these intangible and non-narratable spacings? One needs to connect to one's own pre-individual practices, one's flesh and imaginary, feel the political inside, and then to try and express it. For Beyes and Steyaert, research has to be a performance. Research needs to experiment with the aesthetics and embodiment of research itself. And to provide a non-representational theory from this exploration. The aim of this communication is to experiment the "spacing" proposition of Beyes and Stayeart on the case of Tino Sehgal's exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo, try to produce a non-representational theory/account of this experiment end reflect back on their proposition following this experience. We'll use the turn to affect to inquire on an aesthetical experience (Moriceau, 2016). Main sources will be affectivity and reflexivity on aesthetical experiences as well as interviews of performers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal alignment of non-rigid surfaces from multi-view video observations to obtain a tempo-rally consistent representation. Conventional non-rigid surface tracking performs frame-to-frame alignment which {{is subject to the}} accumulation of errors resulting in drift over time. Recently, non-sequential tracking approaches have been introduced which re-order the input data based on a dissimilarity measure. One or more input sequences are represented in a tree with reducing alignment path length. This limits drift and increases robustness to large non-rigid deformations. However, jumps may occur in the aligned mesh sequence where tree branches meet due to independent error accumulation. Optimisation of the tree for non-sequential tracking is proposed to minimise the errors in temporal consistency due to both the drift and jumps. A novel cluster tree enforces sequential tracking in local segments of the sequence while allowing global non-sequential traversal among these segments. This provides a mechanism to create a tree structure which reduces the number of jumps between branches and limits the length of branches. Comprehensive evaluation is performed on a variety of challenging non-rigid surfaces including <b>faces,</b> <b>cloth</b> and people. This demonstrates that the proposed cluster tree achieves better temporal consistency than the previous sequential and non-sequential tracking approaches. Quantitative ground-truth comparison on a syn-thetic facial performance shows reduced error with the cluster tree...|$|R
5000|$|Lazar houses, {{separate}} {{facilities for}} people with leprosy or other disfiguring diseases sprung up as the disease incidence increased in medieval England soon after the Norman Conquest. The house at Shrewsbury {{was one of the}} earlier ones built; although one source credits King Henry II as its founder, after the time of this story (using admittedly sketchy sources for the list of lazar houses). The church in England made the separation a formal rule in 1175, and the Lateran Council in Rome made it a rule in 1179. Wealth from the land and the many religious houses contributed to the support of the ill. At a lazar house, the inmates are bound by many rules: they must not approach any large town; they must use a clapper or their voice to warn the healthy of their [...] "unclean" [...] presence; and most wear heavy cloaks, even <b>face</b> <b>cloths,</b> to hide their disfigurements.
