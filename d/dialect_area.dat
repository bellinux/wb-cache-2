The second person pronoun, you (and many other occurrences of the same vowel) is {{pronounced}} as in standard English in the west of Cornwall; but east of the Bodmin district, a 'sharpening' of the vowel occurs, which is a feature also found in Devon dialect. Plural nouns such as ha'pennies, pennies and ponies are pronounced in west Cornwall ending not in -eez but in -uz. The pronunciation of the number five varies from foive {{in the west to}} vive in the east, approaching the Devon pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch Low Saxon <b>dialect</b> <b>area,</b> {{comprising}} {{the provinces of}} Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel, {{and parts of the}} province of Gelderland as well. The IJssel roughly forms the linguistic watershed here. This group, which is not Low Franconian but instead Low Saxon and close to neighbouring Low German, has been elevated by the Netherlands (and by Germany) to the legal status of streektaal (regional language) according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It is regarded as Dutch for a number of reasons. From the 14th to 15th century onward, its urban centers (Deventer, Zwolle, Kampen, Zutphen and Doesburg) have been increasingly influenced by the western written Dutch and became a linguistically mixed area. From the 17th century onward, it was gradually integrated into the Dutch language area. Dutch Low Saxon used to be {{at one end of the}} Low German dialect continuum. However, the national border has given way to dialect boundaries coinciding with a political border, because the traditional dialects are strongly influenced by the national standard varieties. Cross-the-border dialects now separated by a plain gap also include South Guelderish and Limburgish on the Dutch side of the border and Meuse-Rhenish on the German side of the border.|$|E

500|$|The English spoken {{today in}} the North has been shaped by the area's history, and some dialects retain {{features}} inherited from Old Norse and the local Celtic languages. Dialects spoken in the North include Cumbrian, Geordie (Newcastle), Mancunian (Manchester), Northumbrian (Northumberland), Pitmatic (Northumberland/County Durham), Scouse (Liverpool) and Tyke (Yorkshire). Linguists have attempted to define a Northern <b>dialect</b> <b>area,</b> corresponding to the area north of a line that begins at the Humber estuary and runs up the River Wharfe and across to the River Lune in north Lancashire. This area corresponds roughly to the sprachraum of the Old English Northumbrian dialect, although the linguistic elements that defined this area in the past, {{such as the use}} of doon instead of down and substitution of an ang sound in words that end -ong (lang instead of long), are now prevalent only in the more northern parts of the region. As speech has changed, there is little consensus on what defines a [...] "Northern" [...] accent or dialect.|$|E
500|$|Gawain's trek {{leads him}} {{directly}} into {{the centre of the}} Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's <b>dialect</b> <b>area</b> and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel ("two myle henne" [...] v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park {{at the bottom of a}} valley ("bothm of the brem valay" [...] v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" [...] v2147) in an enormous fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" [...] v2182-83). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain's journey entitled 'Travels with Sir Gawain' that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.|$|E
500|$|The Aarhus dialect, {{commonly}} called Aarhusiansk (Aarhusian in English), is a Jutlandic dialect in the Mid-Eastern Jutland <b>dialect</b> <b>area,</b> traditionally spoken {{in and around}} Aarhus. Aarhusian, as most local dialects in Denmark, has diminished in use through the 20th century and most Danes today speak some version of Standard Danish with slight regional features. Aarhusian, however, still has a strong presence in older {{segments of the population}} and in areas with high numbers of immigrants surprisingly. Common, traditional and unique Aarhusian words are: træls (tiresome), noller (silly or dumb) and dælme (Excl. damn me). The dialect is notable for single syllable words ending in [...] "d" [...] being pronounced with stød while the same letter in multiple syllable words is pronounced as [...] "j", i.e.. Odder is pronounced [...] "Ojjer". Like other dialects in East Jutland it has two grammatical genders, similar to Standard Danish, but different from West Jutlandic dialects which have only one. In 2009, the University of Aarhus compiled a list of contemporary public figures, who best exemplify the dialect, including Jacob Haugaard, Thomas Helmig, Steffen Brandt, Stig Tøfting, Flemming Jørgensen, Tina Dickow and Camilla Martin. In popular culture, the dialect features prominently in Niels Malmros' movie [...] "Aarhus By Night" [...] and 90s comedy sketches by Jacob Haugaard and Finn Nørbygaard.|$|E

500|$|The Chapel is {{considered}} by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, [...] "the most accursed church", [...] "the place for the Devil to recite matins"; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier Celtic literature. Some scholars have wondered whether [...] "Hautdesert" [...] refers to the Green Chapel, as it means [...] "High Hermitage"; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars. As {{to the location of}} the Chapel, in the Greene Knight poem, Sir Bredbeddle's living place is described as [...] "the castle of hutton", causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in Somerset. Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, {{as it is in the}} writer's <b>dialect</b> <b>area,</b> and matches the land features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to be in either Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott for example located the chapel the knight searches for near ("two myle henne" [...] v1078) the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley ("bothm of the brem valay" [...] v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" [...] v2147) in a large fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" [...] v2182-83).|$|E
