As shown in figure 24a, T(1) consists of 4 icosahedra I(1) which have no <b>direct</b> <b>bonding</b> but are bridged by four B and C20 atoms. These atoms also form tetrahedron centered by the Si2 sites. The supertetrahedron T(2) that consists of 4 icosahedra I(2) is the same as shown in figure 18b; its mixed-occupancy sites B and C6 directly bond with each other. The superoctahedron O(1) consists of 6 icosahedra I(3) and bridge sites B, C18, C1 and Si1; here Si1 and C1 exhibit a tetrahedral arrangement at the center of O(1). Interestingly, the B10 polyhedra also arrange octahedrally, without the central atom, as shown in figure 24c where the B and C19 atoms bridge the B10 polyhedra to form the octahedral supercluster of the B10 polyhedra.|$|E

Therefore, processes for wafer surface activation i.e. plasma treatment or chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), are being considered and are actively being researched. The upper limit of 450 °C bases on the limitations of back-end CMOS processing and the beginning of interactions between the applied materials.|$|E
