5|$|The {{tradition}} of singing carols in pubs around Christmas is still kept {{alive in the}} city. The Sheffield Carols, as they are known locally, predate modern carols by over a century and are sung with alternative words and verses. Although there is a core of carols that are sung at most venues, each particular place has its own mini-tradition. The repertoire at two nearby places can vary widely, and woe betide those who try to strike up a ‘foreign’ carol. Some are unaccompanied, some have a piano or organ, there is a <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> with the words on in one place, a string quartet (quintet, sextet, septet) accompanies the singing at another, some encourage soloists, others stick to audience participation, a brass band plays at certain events, the choir takes the lead at another. It is thought this tradition is now unique in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Smart Way Reading and Spelling {{program is}} {{presented}} {{in a series of}} twenty-seven individual <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> lessons. Each <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text {{on one side of the}} <b>flip</b> <b>chart,</b> while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, helping students grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.|$|E
25|$|After {{converting}} to Christianity, Chick wanted to evangelize others, {{but he was}} too shy to talk to people directly about religion. Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon the idea of creating witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, {{the church}} recast its missionary discussions, {{making them more}} family-friendly and focused on {{building}} on common Christian ideals. The new discussions, named [...] "A Uniform System for Teaching Families", de-emphasized the Great Apostasy, which previously held a prominent position just after {{the story of the}} First Vision. When the discussions were revised in the early 1980s, the new discussions dealt with the apostasy less conspicuously, and in later discussions, rather than in the first discussion. The discussions also became more family-friendly, including a <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1920s {{until the late}} 1960s, many {{department}} stores, drug stores and grocery stores in the U.S. had a self-service tube-vending display. It typically consisted of a tube-tester atop a locked cabinet of tubes, with a <b>flip</b> <b>chart</b> of instructions. One would remove the tubes from a malfunctioning device, such as a radio or television, {{bring them to the}} store, and test them all, looking up the instructions from the model number on the tube and the <b>flip</b> <b>chart.</b> If a tube was defective, store personnel would sell a replacement from the cabinet.|$|E
