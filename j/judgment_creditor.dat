As of December 2004, C/F International was a secured <b>judgment</b> <b>creditor</b> of Classic World Productions and its principal, Darryl Payne, for approximately one million US dollars, and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the subsequent bankruptcy filing by the company. C/F International's action against Classic World Productions and owner Darryl Payne was based on unpaid royalties from This Is Tom Jones and related recordings. This Is Tom Jones is currently sold on DVD by Time Life rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{determine}} when, where, {{and under what}} circumstances the first chattel mortgage statutes arose. This article first examines the southern colonial statutes mentioned in those early American appellate opinions and traces them to their earliest version. The article then explores analogous Anglo-American recording statutes for personalty, some mentioned in the early American appellate opinions as potential sources of the southern colonial chattel mortgage acts. These two investigations establish that the first chattel mortgage acts arose in the Chesapeake colonies during the mid-seventeenth century, shortly after the development of the nonpossessory secured transaction. The article then analyzes the earliest reported southern American opinions, from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, for clues to the circumstances giving rise to the first chattel mortgage acts. Lastly, the article reviews the scanty legislative history concerning these first chattel mortgage acts. These latter two investigations suggest that southern colonial legislatures first passed these statutes to eliminate the secret lien problem for <b>judgment</b> <b>creditors...</b>|$|R
50|$|It may, however, be contended (though {{it is not}} by {{the counsel}} in this case) that the revised charter of 1871 {{introduced}} new impositions additional to the mere water rent, such as authorizing a penalty to be imposed by the Board of Public Works, if payment of the water rents were not made by a certain time, and a heavy rate of interest on rents continuing in arrear. But we look upon these provisions as merely intended to enforce prompt payment and as incidental regulations appropriate to the subject. The law which authorized these coercive measures gave to mortgagees and <b>judgment</b> <b>creditors</b> the right to pay the rents {{and to have the}} benefit of the lien thereof, so that it was in their own power to protect themselves from any such penalties and accumulations of interest. They are analogous to the costs incurred in the foreclosure of the first mortgage, which have the same priority as the mortgage itself over subsequent encumbrances.|$|R
5000|$|The {{context of}} a non-US settlor has a few {{advantages}} over that of a US settlor. The issue of the Full Faith and Credit clause doctrine of the US Constitution would not apply to a non-US settlor facing a non-US <b>judgment.</b> <b>Creditors</b> of non-US settlors would have to first obtain a judgment in their home jurisdiction and then attempt to enforce that [...] "foreign" [...] judgment in the US against the trustee of the USAPT, {{who was not a}} party to the original action. Therefore, except in unusual cases, this would mean that the only issues to litigate would be whether a fraudulent transfer has taken place, and in turn, which jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer laws would apply. Despite that, the non-US creditor must still seek to first have the foreign judgment recognized, because without formal legal acknowledgment of the judgment in the US court, there would be no basis on which to question the transfer.|$|R

40|$|In Hein v. W. T. Rawleigh Co. {{a husband}} and wife {{acquired}} real property in joint tenancy with the wife furnishing all the consideration. However, prior to this acquisition there had been a judgment entered against the husband in another action. The husband conveyed his rights to his wife who later died. Held: The wife’s devisee was entitled to have title to the property quieted subject to the <b>judgment</b> <b>creditor’s</b> lien on an undivided half. This decision presents the alternative questions: (1) whether a judgment lien on one joint tenant’s rights continues undisturbed after a severance caused by release of the debtor’s rights or (2) whether after severance the lien attaches to his severed interest and ceases as to the joint tenant’s rights. In conclusion, this case changes no existing rule of law. Liens may attach to a joint tenant’s rights and may become liens against the whole estate or be lost completely depending on who takes by the right of survivorship. If the property is severed during the lifetime of the tenants, the lien attaches to the judgment debtor’s share. ...|$|R

40|$|Parties {{often take}} {{judgment}} enforcement {{for granted in}} the United States {{as a result of}} decades of reinforcement from the Full Faith and Credit Clause. As the world becomes increasingly globalized, however, corporate defendants may only have nominal holdings within the United States, with the majority of their assets held abroad.

The problem is {{compounded by the fact that}} trade between the United States and China increases every year, leading to a likely corresponding increase in cases where U.
