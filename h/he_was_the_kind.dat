500|$|Editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet and {{the boss}} of Lois Lane. Fishburne is the first African-American to play Perry White in a live-action film. Fishburne stated that he modeled his {{character}} after Ed Bradley, stating that [...] "my inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... legendary Ed Bradley... was a friend, a mentor, and {{a role model for}} me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of guy who walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Kelly {{was raised}} as a Roman Catholic, he later {{described}} himself as a non-believer in any religion. He is the great great grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937. John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: [...] "I have good memories, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of father that, well, I missed him when he died very much. The older children were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me".|$|E
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young man you could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E

500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I {{would like to have}} a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Kenneth Douglass Hubbs {{was more}} than just another {{baseball}} player. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of athlete all games need.

2500|$|The Larry character's {{on-screen}} goofiness {{has been}} described as an extension of Fine's own relaxed personality. Director Charles Lamont recalled: [...] "Larry was a nut. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of guy who always said anything. He was a yapper." [...] Writer-director Edward Bernds remembered that Fine's suggestions for the scripts were often [...] "flaky", but occasionally contained a good comic idea.|$|E

2500|$|Chris Baker, {{the chief}} {{operating}} officer of Three Chimneys, summarized Gun Runner's main assets: [...] "Pedigree. Conformation. Athleticism. Just the way he always carried himself, just very smart, intelligent, classy. Easy-moving horse, kind of scopey and light, but in a good way — just an athlete... We've got a stallion barn that we want to fill. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> that had enough of the attributes on paper, that if he did what we thought he could do, he'd be in our stallion barn. And he hasn't proven us wrong yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E

50|$|Justin Mirichii as Joseph, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a grown man, {{but still}} a mama's boy. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> lazy, less disciplined and a drunkard. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of that waits for his mother to fight what he {{believes}} belongs to him.

60|$|He too {{was trying}} to be {{assertive}} and jesting, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person no one takes any notice of. The girovago rattled on in dialect, poking fun at us and at our being there in this inn. I did not quite follow.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} seldom that I uttered more than monosyllables in Dr. John's presence; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person with whom I was likely ever {{to remain the}} neutral, passive thing he thought me. Now, however, I took licence to answer in a phrase: and a phrase I {{purposely}} made quite significant.|$|E
60|$|Despite her {{antipathy}} toward Sage King, Lucy {{could not}} gaze at him without all a rider's glory in a horse. He was sleek, so graceful, so racy, so near the soft gray of the sage, so beautiful in build and action. Then <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> {{of a horse}} {{that did not have}} to be eternally watched. He was spirited and full of life, eager to run, but when Farlane called for him to stand still he obeyed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of a horse that a child could have played around in safety. He never kicked. He never bit. He never bolted. It was splendid to see him with Farlane or with Bostil. He did not like Lucy very well, a fact that perhaps accounted for Lucy's antipathy. For that matter, he did not like any woman. If he had a bad trait, it came out when Van rode him, but all the riders, and Bostil, too, claimed that Van was to blame for that.|$|E

50|$|Segawa Hiroki is Reiji Takayama's {{assistant}} and right hand man. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> always prepared {{and is a}} very capable assistant. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person who loves power and his loyalty lies with who ever <b>is</b> stronger. <b>He</b> {{describes himself as a}} person who loves to follow those who have power, and demonstrates it by switching sides with whoever wields the most powerful position within Dohji Industries. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> last seen standing with the Dohji recovery team on a bridge wishing Takayama good luck.|$|R
60|$|He went up a short, tiled {{path and}} rang the bell. A smart maid-servant showed {{him into a}} small, morning-room, where {{everything}} was very neat, {{and after a few}} moments a man came in. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man Foster had expected to find in such a house, well-dressed, with polite but rather formal manners, and Foster briefly stated his business. He thought the man looked at him sharply, but it was about four o'clock in the afternoon and the light was not good.|$|E
60|$|Later Stewart {{led them}} across a {{neck of the}} park, up a rather steep climb between towering crags, {{to take them out}} upon a grassy {{promontory}} that faced the great open west--a vast, ridged, streaked, and reddened sweep of earth rolling down, as it seemed, to the golden sunset end of the world. Castleton said it was a jolly fine view; Dorothy voiced her usual languid enthusiasm; Helen was on fire with pleasure and wonder; Mrs. Beck appealed to Bobby to see how he liked it before she ventured, and she then reiterated his praise; and Edith Wayne, like Madeline and Florence, was silent. Boyd was politely interested; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man who appeared to care for things as other people cared for them.|$|E

[...] Mrs. March faced her book down in her lap, and listened as if there might be some reason in the nonsense I was talking. [...] "You might say that he was a society man, and was in great request, and then intimate that there was a prior attachment, or that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man who would never marry, but was really cold-hearted with all his sweetness, and merely had a passion for studying character." ...|$|E

When <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not practicing at the piano, he’s writing either original works, or arrangements.

60|$|Henchard in the {{meantime}} had gone upstairs. Papers of a domestic nature he kept in a drawer in his bedroom, and this he unlocked. Before turning them over he leant back and indulged in reposeful thought. Elizabeth was his at last {{and she was a}} girl of such good sense and kind heart that she would be sure to like him. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man to whom some human object for pouring out his heart upon--were it emotive or were it choleric--was almost a necessity. The craving for his heart for the re-establishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during his wife's lifetime, and now he had submitted to its mastery without reluctance and without fear. He bent over the drawer again, and proceeded in his search.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Acton {{was sitting}} on the veranda next morning when Nasmyth, fresh from a swim in the deep cold water of the inlet, came up across the clearing. It had brought a clear glow into his bronzed skin and a {{brightness}} to his eyes, and as he flung a word to a man who greeted him, his laugh had a clean, wholesome ring. He walked straight toward the veranda, and Mrs. Acton, sitting still, favoured him with a very keen and careful scrutiny. He was dressed in light flannels, which, she admitted, became him rather well; but it was the lithe gracefulness of his movements that she noticed most. His easy, half-whimsical manner had their effect on her; they won her favour. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of guest she had pleasure in welcoming at Bonavista.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} cause of that spirited disaster, {{the intervention of}} England {{on behalf of the}} new Hohenzollern throne, was due, of course, to the national policy of the first William Pitt. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of man whose vanity and simplicity are too easily overwhelmed by the obvious. He saw nothing in a European crisis except a war with France; and nothing in a war with France except a repetition of the rather fruitless glories of Agincourt and Malplaquet. He was of the Erastian Whigs, sceptical but still healthy-minded, and neither good enough nor bad enough to understand that even the war of that irreligious age was ultimately a religious war. He had not a shade of irony in his whole being; and beside Frederick, already as old as sin, he was like a rather brilliant schoolboy.|$|E
2500|$|Historian Fred Anderson {{says that}} Washington's Providence was, [...] "a {{generally}} benevolent, {{as well as}} an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being, but <b>He</b> <b>was</b> hardly <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of warm and loving God embraced by the evangelical Protestants." ...|$|R
