5|$|During World War Two, Destroyers served {{three basic}} functions: first, {{to act as}} {{screening}} ships to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> fleets from enemy fleets, second, to attack the screening ships of enemy fleets, and third, to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> fleet from submarines. How the destroyers were actually used varied upon the country. Germany abandoned the third function almost entirely, which showed in German destroyers' lack of strong anti-submarine armament, preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re-fitted as minelayers. The role of the destroyer began to vary much more heavily as WW2 progressed; where the British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes, and sinking submarines, the Germans had destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> homes by staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E
5|$|Näslund {{made his}} first {{international}} appearance for Sweden at the 1989 Four Nations Tournament in the Soviet Union.

He improved the following year with a tournament-leading 14goals. His 16points ranked second overall to teammate Peter Forsberg. Sweden failed to <b>defend</b> <b>their</b> gold medal.|$|E
