25|$|The British Rail Class 73 is a British <b>electro-diesel</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The type {{is unusual}} in that it can operate from the Southern Region's 650/750 V DC third-rail or an {{on-board}} diesel engine {{to allow it to}} operate on non-electrified routes. This makes it very versatile, although the diesel engine produces less power than is available from the third-rail supply so the locomotives rarely stray from the former Southern Region of British Rail. Following the withdrawal and scrapping of the more powerful Class 74 electro-diesels in 1977, the Class 73 is now unique on the British railway network. Ten locomotives have been scrapped.|$|E
