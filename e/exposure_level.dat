40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Background: Platinum {{refinery}} {{workers are}} exposed to various elements during the refining process, with soluble platinum salts posing a potential health risk. Platinum salts are extremely potent sensitisers that can result in the clinical syndrome of platinum salt sensitivity (PSS) that leads to skin and respiratory hypersensitivity in refinery workers. Several published research articles document refinery workers’ <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to soluble platinum salts during production. However, the <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to soluble platinum salts during non–routine stock take activities are unknown although cases of sensitisation have been diagnosed following these nonoperational periods. Stock take for the platinum refinery under study commenced on 18 January 2010 and ended 22 February 2010. Increased {{emphasis was placed on}} flushing plant equipment rather than dismantling it. The aim was to dismantle 10 % of what previously was dismantled {{to reduce the risk of}} exposing employees to soluble platinum salts, to reduce the chance of damaging plant equipment and for cost and time saving purposes. Aim: The objectives of this study are to: (i) quantify work area and personal exposure levels; (ii) identify work areas and work practices with <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> exceeding the occupational exposure limit (OEL) (> 2 ug/m 3); (iii) determine whether <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> differ significantly between: a) personal sampling groups (engineering versus production), b) area sampling groups (open versus closed–face sampling), c) work areas, d) total area and total personal sampling groups and to (iv) evaluate the efficiency of the current control measures utilised. Design and Method: A total of 58 platinum samples were collected, consisting of 38 personal and 20 area samples. Personal sampling consisted of Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) samplers housing reusable 25 mm filter cassettes with mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane filters for the collection of inhalable airborne particles. Because both the cassette and the filter were pre and post–weighed as a single unit, all particles collected (even those against the walls of the cassette) were included in the analysis. Sampling was conducted in accordance with the stock take schedule and scope and included a roster for the systematic dismantling and cleaning of the refinery, following the process flow. A target population of maximum five fitters and five operators per area were identified, responsible for dismantling and cleaning plant equipment respectively. The sampling strategy was based on the identification and sampling of employees presumed to have the highest exposure risk. The Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual (OESSM) refers to this as the “maximum risk employees” (Liedel et al., 1977). The selection of the maximum risk employees was done with reasonable certainty since the employees sampled were working closest to the source of exposure. Sampling was conducted for the total duration of the task consisting of single sample measurements. Area sampling was conducted by means of BUCKAir high volume samplers fitted with preweighed 47 mm MCE filter cassettes to show the spread of the contaminant in the work area. The high volume samplers were calibrated to operate at a sampling volume of 20 L/min. The sampling heads were positioned 1. 5 m from the ground surface and as near as possible to the work location or failing this as near as is possible to major sources of exposure. Samples were collected and analysed according to the method for the determination of hazardous substances 46 / 2 (MDHS 46 / 2). This is an advanced sampling and analysis standard which enables detection of low levels of soluble platinum (0. 01 ug/m 3). Results: Thirty eight personal platinum samples were collected, consisting of a sampled engineering (n= 15) and production (n= 23) subgroup. Out of the thirty eight personal samples taken in total, 21 % of the samples’ concentrations exceeded the OEL of 2 ug/m 3 and ranged between 0. 004 – 20. 479 ug/m 3. Twenty area platinum samples were collected, consisting of open (n= 10) and closed face (n= 10) sampling. Out of the twenty area samples taken in total, 10 % of the samples’ concentrations exceeded the OEL of 2 ug/m 3 and ranged between 0. 0004 – 5. 752 ug/m 3. The mean personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for the production subgroup (2. 739 ug/m 3) were significantly higher compared to the engineering subgroup’s mean personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 393 ug/m 3). This significant difference (p= 0. 033) was expected since the production subgroup was more exposed and involved in the digging out of residues and the cleaning of plant equipment compared to the engineering subgroup with limited exposure and involved in the opening of plant equipment. Although the mean <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for open face sampling (0. 725 ug/m 3) were higher compared to the mean <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> for closed face sampling (0. 441 ug/m 3) no significant difference (p= 0. 579) were noted. The mean area <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 583 ug/m 3) were significantly lower (p= 0. 004) compared to the mean personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> (1. 813 ug/m 3) for similar areas and tasks performed and, therefore, not an effective indicator of personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Higher personal <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> were expected since the workers were closer to the source of exposure and since the platinum salts could have diluted in the workplace’s air resulting in lower area <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Conclusion: The research study addressed the problem statement, met the objectives set out in Chapter 1, hypotheses were accepted and rejected and future studies were recommended. It was hypothesised that: a) refinery workers {{are exposed to}} airborne soluble platinum during non–operational periods; b) <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> do not differ significantly between the personal sampling groups (engineering vs production); c) <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> do not differ significantly between the area sampling groups (open versus closed–face sampling); d) <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> do not differ significantly between work areas; e) <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> differ significantly between total personal and total area sampling groups. The results confirmed that refinery workers are exposed to airborne soluble platinum during non–operational periods and hypothesis a was accepted.

We used data from epidemiological studies of diesel exposures to perform a quantitative risk assessment to calculate DME <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> expressed as elemental carbon (EC), corresponding to acceptable risk (AR) and maximum tolerable risk (MTR) levels of 4 to 10 (- 5) and 4 to 10 (- 3) for the lifetime excess probability of dying from lung cancer. METHODS: Previously published slope estimates (n= 14) of the exposure-response curve (ERC) for EC exposure and lung cancer were used in life-table analyses to calculate EC <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> corresponding to the specified AR and MTR levels. RESULTS: Considered ERC slope factors ranged from 0. 00060 to 0. 0012  natural logarithm of the relative rate (InRR) per μg/m(3)  years based on different selections of studies and study-specific risk estimates. Exposure limits based on these slope factors were between 0. 009 - 0. 017 and 0. 85 - 1. 67  μg/m(3) EC for the AR and MTR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Derived exposure limits based on the AR and MTR are around or well below 1  μg/m(3) EC. Such limits are below current occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> {{and in some instances}} even below environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>levels.</b> Although uncertainties exist in the exact slope factors, these results indicate that an acceptable excess lung cancer mortality risk can only be achieved at very low DME <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> suggesting that diesel engines using older technologies should be removed from the workplace when possible or emissions strictly controlled...|$|R

40|$|Rationale and Objectives. Higher patient <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} for 64 -row multidetector computed tomography raphy (MDCT) compared to 16 -row MDCT. The objective {{of this study was}} to make a thorough comparison by evaluating the impact of scan length on the <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> at 16 -row MDCT and 64 -row MDCT. Materials and Methods. Dose-length product (DLP) values were determined to compare <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> in 16 - and 64 -row MDCT. This Phantom study does not deal with a possible reduction in image quality induced by an increase in scattered radiation in 64 -row MDCT compared to 16 -row MDCT. Results. The <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> of 64 -row MDCT (scan slice thickness, 0. 5 mm) are LIP to 18 % lower than those of 16 -row MDCT at slice thickness 0. 5 ruin when scanning an object larger than 12. 3 cm. At this value, the plots of the 16 - and 64 -row DLP values versus scan length cross. The DLP Curves of 1 - and 2 -mm slice thickness 16 -row MDCT are in closer resemblance to those of 0. 5 -mm 64 -row MDCT. The respective <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> of 1 - and 2 -mm slice thickness 16 -row MDCT exceed those of 0. 5 -mm 64 -row MDCT by Lip to 4 % and 3 %, with intersections of 30 and 25 cm, respectively. Conclusion. Lower effective doses are obtained in 64 -row MDCT compared to 16 -row MDCT (0. 5 -mm slice thickness) provided that scan length exceeds 12. 3, 30, and 25 cm, for 16 -row MDCT slice thickness of 0. 5, 1, and 2 mm, respectively. Reduced effective dosage in 64 -row MDCT compared to 16 -row MDCT has not been dernonstrated before. Differences in object size may thus explain discrepancies between previous studies with regard to the <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> at 64 -slice CT compared to 16 -slice CT...|$|R

One hundred and seventy-nine respirable dust samples were collected in the six mines studied, in compliance with the method recommended by the Institut de recherche en sante et securite du travail du Quebec (IRSST). Then, samples were analysed using X ray powder diffraction technique to determine respirable quartz concentrations. Results indicated statistically significant differences in the normalised <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable dust (p = 0. 017), to respirable quartz (p < 0. 001) as well as the quartz percentage in the respirable dust (p < 0. 001) of the six mines studied. When grouped by ore deposit type, normalized <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable dust were not statistically different. However, statistically significant differences were noticed for normalized <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable quartz (p = 0. 004) and respirable quartz percentage (p < 0. 001) according to ore deposit types. For all mines studied, respirable dust concentrations were all below the admissible exposure value whereas about 9 % of the respirable quartz concentrations were equal or above the admissible exposure limit. Gold ore deposits hosted in quartz veins had the highest normalized respirable quartz <b>exposure</b> <b>levels,</b> as well as the highest percentage of quartz in the respirable dust when compared to gold ore deposits with sulfide lodes, the copper-zinc ore deposit and the disseminated gold ore deposit. The study also revealed that workers who worked in the ore crushing and hoisting departments as well as loading and transport had higher normalised <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable quartz than workers who worked in the drilling and blasting or those who worked in the maintenance department. In conclusion, this study stressed that quartz content in the mined rocks seems to be the most important factor influencing on respirable quartz concentrations in the mine worker's respiratory zone, but the relation between the two variables were not strongly correlated (Rs = 0. 254, p = 0. 005). Furthermore, the study showed that the gold ore deposits with quartz lodes had the highest normalized <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable quartz. Also, the workers assigned to ore crushing and hoisting departments as well as transport and loading had the highest <b>exposure</b> <b>levels</b> to respirable quartz.
