Her name may have been Ariadne until 1786 when she started to engage in whaling. Next, as Mary Ann, she made one voyage transporting convicts to New South Wales from England.

Next, she became a West Indiaman, trading between London or Liverpool to Demerara. It was on one of those voyages in November 1801 that a French privateer captured her.|$|E
60|$|May 6. A {{good many}} calls this morning. Among others came Miss Greenfield, the (so called) Black Swan. She {{appears to be}} a gentle, amiable, and {{interesting}} young person. She was born the slave of a kind mistress, who gave her every thing but education, and, dying, left her free with a little property. The property she lost by some legal quibble, but had, like others of her race, a passion for music, and could sing and play by ear. A young lady, discovering her taste, gave her a few lessons. She has a most astonishing voice. C. sat down to the piano and played, while she sung. Her voice runs through a compass of three octaves and a fourth. This is four notes more than Malibran's. She sings a most magnificent tenor, with such a breadth and volume of sound that, with your back turned, you could not imagine it to be a woman. While she was there, Mrs. S.C. Hall, of the Irish Sketches, was announced. She is a tall, well-proportioned woman, with a fine color, dark-brown hair, and a cheerful, cordial manner. She brought with her her only daughter, a young girl about fifteen. I told her of Miss Greenfield, and, she took great interest in her, and requested her to sing something for <b>her.</b> <b>C.</b> played the accompaniment, and she sung Old Folks at Home, first in a soprano voice, and then in a tenor or baritone. Mrs. Hall was amazed and delighted, and entered at once into her cause. She said that she would call with me and present her to Sir George Smart, who is {{at the head of the}} queen's musical establishment, and, of course, the acknowledged leader of London musical judgment.|$|E

50|$|Emperor Ichijō's court, {{dominated}} by the powerful Fujiwara clan, was the seat of two rival imperial empresses, Teishi and Shōshi, each with ladies-in-waiting who were proficient writers producing works honoring their mistresses and the Fujiwara clan. The three most noteworthy Heian era diaries in the genre of Nikki Bungaku - Murasaki's Murasaki Shikibu nikki, Sei Shōnagon's The Pillow Book and Izumi Shikibu's (Izumi Shikibu Nikki) - came from the empresses's courts. Murasaki's diary covers a discrete period, most likely from 1008 to 1010. Only short and fragmentary pieces of the diary survive and its importance lies, in part, in the revelations about the author, about whom most of the known biographical facts come from it and from <b>her</b> <b>c.</b> 1014 short poetry collection, the Murasaki Shikibu shū (or Poetic Memoirs).|$|E
5000|$|C. S.

In 1908, their mother died from cancer and as their father mourned <b>her,</b> <b>C.</b> S. ("Jack") and Warren Lewis had only each other for comfort and support. Soon after their mother's death, Jack was sent across the Irish Channel to join Warren at an English boarding school named Wynyard in Watford, Hertfordshire, just northwest of London, where they both endured a harsh headmaster named Robert Capron. Warren had been taken there by his mother Flora on 10 May 1905. In 1909, Warren transferred to Malvern College in Worcestershire (Mid-West England) and was followed there by his brother a few years later. Warren completed his education at Malvern in 1913.|$|E

Varner was surprised to discover that she had been chosen {{to be a part of}} the Grammy in the Schools Mentoring Program. Through this program she was taken weekly to the Fox Studio, where she met with mentor Kelly Burgos, and President of Fox Music, Robert Kraft. Soon after, Varner hesitantly applied to NYU with <b>her</b> <b>C</b> average and was surprisingly accepted. Not only did she get in, but also she was admitted into the second class of the Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music. Upon graduating, she was awarded [...] "most likely to get signed" [...] and [...] "most likely to win a Grammy." [...] Four years later she finds herself a well-rounded and cultured singer-songwriter. In 2008 Varner graduated from NYU's renowned Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.In October 2009 she signed with MBK/J-RCA Records along with a co-publishing agreement with Sony Music. After honing her skills even further, Varner became one of the first artists featured in BET’s Music Matters campaign for 2010.|$|E
