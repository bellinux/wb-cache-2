5|$|Blue whales feed almost {{exclusively}} on krill, though they also take small numbers of copepods. The species of this zooplankton eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the usual food; in the North Pacific, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera, Nyctiphanes symplex and Nematoscelis megalops; and in the Southern Hemisphere, <b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba,</b> Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia valentini, and Nyctiphanes australis.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{macaroni}} penguin {{consists of}} a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba),</b> account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), Champsocephalus gunneri, the lanternfish species Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum tenisoni and P. normani become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba).</b> The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe.|$|E
25|$|Well-known {{species of}} the Euphausiidae of {{commercial}} krill fisheries include Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba),</b> Pacific krill (E. pacifica) and Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica).|$|E
25|$|The annual {{catch of}} <b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba</b> {{since the mid-1990s}} is about 100–120,000 tonnes annually, i.e., about one fiftieth of the CCAMLR catch quota. Still, the CCAMLR is criticized for having defined its catch limits too generously, as there are no precise {{estimates}} of the total biomass of Antarctic krill available {{and there have been}} reports indicating that it is declining since the 1990s. Plans to take up to 746,000 tonnes a year were disclosed at the 2007 meeting of CCAMLR.|$|E
25|$|Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba)</b> is {{a species}} of krill found in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. It is a small, {{swimming}} crustacean that lives in large schools, called swarms, sometimes reaching densities of 10,000–30,000 individual animals per cubic metre. It feeds directly on minute phytoplankton, thereby using the primary production energy that the phytoplankton originally derived from the sun in order to sustain their pelagic (open ocean) life cycle. It grows to a length of , weighs up to , and can live {{for up to six}} years. It is a key species in the Antarctic ecosystem and is, in terms of biomass, probably the most abundant animal species on the planet (approximately 500 million tonnes, corresponding to 300 to 400 trillion individuals).|$|E
25|$|Krill are {{considered}} an important trophic level connection – {{near the bottom}} of the food chain – because they feed on phytoplankton and (to a lesser extent) zooplankton, converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for which krill make up the largest part of their diets. In the Southern Ocean, one species, the Antarctic krill, <b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba,</b> makes up an estimated biomass of around 379,000,000 tonnes, making it among the species with the largest total biomass. Of this, over half is eaten by whales, seals, penguins, squid, and fish each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, thus providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.|$|E
25|$|Krill {{typically}} {{follow a}} diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they {{spend the day}} at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which implies {{a role in the}} Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., <b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba,</b> E. pacifica, E. hanseni, Pseudeuphausia latifrons, and Thysanoessa spinifera) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
25|$|Planktonic copepods are {{important}} to global ecology and the carbon cycle. They are usually the dominant members of the zooplankton, and are major food organisms for small fish such as the dragonet, banded killifish, whales, seabirds, Alaska pollock, and other crustaceans such as krill in the ocean and in fresh water. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. Copepods compete for this title with Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba).</b> C. glacialis inhabits {{the edge of the}} Arctic icepack, especially in polynyas where light (and photosynthesis) is present, in which they alone comprise up to 80% of zooplankton biomass. They bloom as the ice recedes each spring. The ongoing large reductions in the annual minimum of recent years may force them to compete in the open ocean with the much less nourishing C. finmarchicus, which is spreading from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea.|$|E
2500|$|The krill {{fishery is}} the {{commercial}} fishery of krill, small shrimp-like marine animals {{that live in}} the oceans world-wide. The present estimate for the biomass of Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba)</b> [...] is 379 million tonnes. The total global harvest of krill from all fisheries amounts to 150–200,000 tonnes annually, mainly Antarctic krill and North Pacific krill (E. pacifica).....|$|E
2500|$|In the Antarctic, seven {{species are}} known, one in genus Thysanoessa (T. macrura) and six in Euphausia. The Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba)</b> {{commonly}} lives at depths reaching , whereas ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) reach depth of , though they commonly inhabit depths of at most [...] Both are found at latitudes south of 55°S, with E. crystallorophias dominating south of 74°S and in regions of pack ice.

2500|$|Most krill are {{swarming}} animals; {{the sizes}} and densities of such swarms vary by species and region. For <b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba,</b> swarms reach 10,000 to 60,000 individuals per cubic meter. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out individuals. In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented {{what appears to be a}} successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: [...] " [...] (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five {{species of}} krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, {{are found in}} the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba)</b> {{is one of the most}} {{abundant}} animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is [...] long and weighs over [...] [...] The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per , turning the water red. Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival. During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.|$|E
2500|$|Krill {{fishery in}} the Southern Ocean targets the largest species of krill existing, the Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba),</b> which can grow to about [...] Fishing {{began in the}} early 1960s, when the Soviet Union {{launched}} its first experimental operations. All throughout the decade, preparatory activities were carried out, resulting in small catches of a few tens of tonnes per year. Scientists mapped the locations of krill swarms to determine the best fishing grounds, and engineers developed and improved the equipment necessary to fish and process krill. In 1972, the Soviets set up a permanent fishery in Antarctic waters, landing 7,500 tonnes in 1973 and then expanding quickly. The Japanese began experimental krill fishing operation in the area in 1972 and started full-scale commercial operations in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its name, the crabeater seal {{does not}} feed on crabs (the few crab species in its range are mostly found in very deep water). Rather, it is a {{specialist}} predator on Antarctic krill (<b>Euphausia</b> <b>superba),</b> which comprise over 90% of the diet. Their high abundance {{is a testament}} to the extreme success of Antarctic krill, the single species with the greatest biomass on the planet. There is little seasonality in their prey preference, but they may target adult and male krill. [...] Other prey items include cephalopods and diverse Antarctic fish species. [...] Although the crabeater seal is sympatric with the other Antarctic seal species (Weddell, Ross and leopard seals), the specialization on krill minimizes interspecific food competition. Among krill-feeding whales, only blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and minke whales (B. acutorostrata) extend their range as far south as the pack ice where the crabeater seals are most frequent.|$|E
