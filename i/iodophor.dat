Drawbacks to its use in the form of aqueous solutions include irritation at the site of application, toxicity, and the staining of surrounding tissues.

5000|$|Iodine {{is usually}} {{used in an}} alcohol {{solution}} (called tincture of iodine) or as Lugol's iodine solution as a pre- and postoperative antiseptic. Some people do not recommend disinfecting minor wounds with iodine because of concern that it may induce scar tissue formation and increase healing time.

[...] Novel iodine antiseptics containing povidone-iodine (an <b>iodophor,</b> complex of povidone, a water-soluble polymer, with triiodide anions I3−, containing about 10% of active iodine) are far better tolerated, do not negatively affect wound healing, and leave a deposit of active iodine, thereby creating the so-called [...] "remnant", or persistent, effect.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{concentrations}} of <b>iodophor</b> necessary {{to reduce the}} activity of several metabolic enzyme systems 50 percent {{was used as the}} basic approach in attempts to elucidate the mechanism of germicidal action of iodine. For comparisons, a chlorine-releasing germicide (Trichlorocide) and a quaternary ammonium compound were also tested. It was found that on parts per million basis, Trichlorocide inhibited the activity of most of the enzymes 50 percent in smaller concentrations than either <b>iodophor</b> or the quaternary ammonium compound. However on a molar basis <b>iodophor</b> was the most effective in inhibiting the activity of a majority of the enzymes. Conversely, the activity of most enzymes was not inhibited by the quaternary ammonium compound. In all tests where there was at least 50 percent inhibition of enzyme activity, the concentration of the germicide was well below that normally used for disinfection and sanitation purposes, providing further evidence on the sensitive nature of certain enzyme systems to inactivation by small {{concentrations of}} germicide. Alcohol dehydrogenase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase when partially inactivated by <b>iodophor</b> were completely reactivated by glutathione and cysteine respectively. Likewise, cysteine was able to partially reverse <b>iodophor</b> inactivated lactic dehydrogenase. This evidence indicated that <b>iodophor</b> inactivated these enzymes, at least in part, through oxidation of their essential sulfhydryl groups. In addition, the activity of catalase was reduced 60 percent when the enzyme was exposed to 60 ppm <b>iodophor</b> under alkaline conditions indicating that the inactivation occurred as a result of iodination reactions. Only partial success was achieved in efforts to demonstrate the in vivo oxidation of yeast glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase sulfhydryl groups by <b>iodophor.</b> In comparing the effects of <b>iodophor</b> and Trichlorocide on glucose oxidation and viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, it was found that with an exposure time of 30 seconds at one and two ppm, <b>iodophor</b> inhibited both glucose oxidation and viable cell count {{to a greater extent than}} Trichlorocide. However when the exposure time was increased to five minutes, Trichlorocide was a more effective inhibitor. Cysteine and dithiothreitol were able to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of <b>iodophor</b> on glucose oxidation and completely restore viable cell counts. With both Pseudomonas fragi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells, as little as 0. 75 ppm of <b>iodophor</b> was able to substantially reduce glucose oxidation and cell viability. Dithiothreitol was able to partially reverse these inhibitory effects.

P. aeruginosa organisms isolated from PxI and adapted for growth in distilled water or found {{as part of a}} mixed microbial population from water in a manufacturing plant did not survive more than 15 s after challenge in stock PxI solution. Batches of PxI were compounded in the laboratory to determine the survival and growth of P. aeruginosa during the various stages of preparation. No P. aeruginosa organisms were recovered from the finished product at 1 min after the addition of iodine-iodide. However, we found P. aeruginosa in PxI 48 h after adding sterile PxI to the inside of a naturally contaminated polyvinyl chloride water distribution pipe. These organisms (10 (4) CFU/ml) survived for as long as 98 days in contaminated stock PxI after it was removed from the polyvinyl chloride pipe. Both decreasing the free iodine level through addition of potassium iodide and increasing the free iodine level through dilution of the product resulted in an increased length of survival of P. aeruginosa in contaminated PxI solution. Comparative survival studies with pipes of different composition revealed that other materials may exert an effect similar to polyvinyl chloride.

40|$|A gas chromatographic method {{suitable}} for determination of blood iodide in concentrations reported for burn patients treated with <b>iodophors</b> is described.

In t roduct ion Iodine remains an inexpensive and effective antiseptic for ex-ternal use. Over the last decade, {{there have been several}} reports of possible systemic toxicity following absorption of topically applied iodine (i- 6). Extensively burned patients are at highest risk. Iodine is converted to iodide upon absorption and is ex-creted by the kidney. Renal failure increases the risk of toxicity. Excess iodide can be removed effectively by dialysis. Analysis of blood for iodide has been used to monitor absorption and excretion of iodide. The colorimetric method of Sandell and Kolthoff (7) has am-ple sensitivity to detect he absorption of iodine. In practice, it also has adequate specificity, although divalent cations in-cluding those of Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, Hg, Cr III, and Ag 1 can interfere (8). Inasmuch as the method requires careful atten-tion to timing, it is enhanced if used with automated analyzers.

Non-alcoholic solutions continue to be used for disinfection of mucous membranes, but iodine-based products are being phased out here. The term “instrument disinfection” has been largely supplanted now by the expression “instrument reprocessing or medical device decontamination” (which is also underpinned by legislation) and it takes account of the trend towards thermal disinfection. Meticulous cleaning is thus an indispensable precondition for sterilization, which normally follows disinfection. The greatest lack of consensus at European level relates to surface disinfection. Routine, parallel cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces close to and remote from the patient is being increasingly replaced by selective disinfection, whenever warranted, of surfaces close to the patient.

40|$|Endemic goitre due {{mainly to}} iodine {{deficiency}} {{has been recorded}} {{in many areas of}} the world throughout history and its response to crude iodine preparations has been noted. The good effect of the pure element in the treatment of goitre was modified by severe thyrotoxic reactions, reported particularly from areas of endemic goitre. A rational basis for the use of iodine in prophylaxis against goitre, came with the discoveries linking iodine with thyroid metabolism and measurements of low iodine concentrations in water, soil and plants. Mountainous areas which are far from the sea and have been subjected to glaciation in the last Ice Age are particularly prone to iodine deficiency. The excellent response to iodine prophylaxis in preventing goitre in the children of Ohio, U. S. A. was followed by an equally good one in Switzerland. However there were further reports of thyrotoxicosis following iodine prophylaxis again occurring in adult goitrous females. It was thought by those who believed that iodine caused thyrotoxicosis in some people, that the size of' thedose given was important but examples suggest that this was not so. Indeed many authorities denied the existence of iodbasedow. Tasmania has been a very satisfactory area to observe these phenomena. Population shifts are minimal and it was a moderately iodine deficient island with a goitre incidence among adult females of approximately 30 per cent. Although goitregens were pro- posed as a contributing cause of goitre none such have been found. Iodation of bread gave universal prophylaxis to the population and an excellent response has been achieved. Goitre prevalence in children has fallen to that seen in countries where goitre is not endemic. The pathology of goitre in Tasmania is similar to that seen in all parts of the world. There does not seem to be any increased incidence of thyroid cancer, cretinism is rare and before iodation of bread the incidence of thyrotoxicosis was lower than that recorded in iodine sufficient communities. Several factors have combined to produce a change in iodine content in the environment of Tasmania, before iodation of bread. The importation of large amounts of food from areas of Australia which are not iodine deficient and the use of <b>iodophors</b> in the food industry provided extra iodine. Several other sources of iodine were brought to Tasmania resulting in a gradual increase in iodine consumption. A steady increase in the incidence of thyrotoxicosis was noticed from 1960, as shown in Fig. 10 - 2 with a sudden rise which has continued from 1966 when bread was iodated. It is suggested that the incidence of thyrotoxicosis has risen to that occurring in nonendemic goitre areas, previous iodine deficiency having protected those otherwise prone to develope the disease. If this is so, the incidence will remain similar to that of the average world incidence for non-endemic goitre areas, but the age group affected should become progressively younger. The addition of iodine to the diet of the population of Tasmania can be justified by the disappearance of goitre and consequent decrease in thyrocardiac disease which is associated with nodular goitre in middle age, the probable disappearance of. lethal cancer of the thyroid in the elderly, tracheal obstruction by retrosternal goitre and the cosmetic effect in females who formed the majority affected by the condition. It is predicted that the price for this will be a slight increase in the incidence of thyrotoxicosis in an age group which will become progressively younger and more able to cope with the disease. On balance at the present time this price is reasonable. Evidence to support these assumptions are presented in the body of the thesis...|$|R
