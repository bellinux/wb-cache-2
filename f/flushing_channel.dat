40|$|Abstract – About 1 % of {{the total}} storage {{capacity}} in the world’s reservoirs is lost annually due to sedimentation. Sediments can also block intakes in reservoirs and damage tunnels or turbines. One {{of the most effective}} techniques to remove these sediments is flushing, whereby water level is lowered sufficiently to re-erode deposits and flush them through the intakes. Outflow sediment discharge may well be related to the parameters such as the sediment characteristics in the reservoir, during flushing and geometry of <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> In this study, laboratory experiments were performed on a 1 -D reservoir model in a flume in the hydraulics laboratory of Shiraz University to investigate the flushing operation processes by using polymer particles. The polymer particles were lightweight and non-cohesive with an average grain size of about 2. 40 mm and density of 1065. 3 (kg/m 3). The model was installed in a flume; 30 m long, 1 m wide and 0. 75 m height. The length of the test section was 11. 5 m, and sediments were placed at a length of 4. 8 m long upstream from the dam position. Experimental runs have been performed for two flow conditions; 0. 0004678 m 3 /s and 0. 000628 m 3 /s. The very low inflow discharge helped for better monitoring and measuring of the effective parameters. A sluice gate was placed at the central bottom of the dam (as the bottom outlet) and was opened at a constant rate to make the complete drawdown. Results showed that the rate of sediment flushing is strongly associated with outflow rate, water surface gradient with the dam section and the width of the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> The results from this study were in agreement with that in the literature. It is considered that the low density of the particles causes them to behave as very fine and non-cohesive sediment particles, like loess sediments...|$|E

Vancouver Lake is a large lake, connected directly to the Columbia River through the Lake River {{to the north and}} the constructed <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> on the eastern shore. A total of 16 species of fish were encountered, mostly warmwater game fish with a few seasonal visitors. The lake has suffered from water quality problems, and during the 1970 s, it was dredged, and a channel was created to aid in increasing the water turnover rate, effectively connecting both ends of the lake to the Columbia River. As there is direct access to the Columbia River, managing this lake as a closed system may prove difficult. It is of our opinion that it may be a more effective use of resources to increase the anglers access to the available resources through providing improved boat launch access, and fish habitat structure throughout the lake. Additionally, educating the public about the how-to's of common carp angling could possibly open up additional resources not commonly utilized by the public. (Document pdf contains 38 pages...|$|E
40|$|The Langmann {{reservoir}} {{is part of}} the hydropower {{system in}} the river Teigitsch and in the reservoir loss of storage volume occurs. The reservoir was therefore flushed, but recently no permission is granted. The reason is the high sediment concentrations that have negative effects on the downstream region. An optimization of the flushing operations that reduces the negative effects and recovers most of the storage volume is required. Hence, insight in the flushing operations and identification of the key processes that determine the flushing efficiency are required. The reservoir is flushed by creating a riverine flow. The key processes that occur during flushing are classified as progressive erosion, retrogressive erosion and bank erosion. The flushing operations are in the maintenance phase; a channel is already formed and only recently deposited sediments are flushed out of the channel. A large peak in the sediment concentration at the transition of drawdown to riverine flow occurs. The Delft 3 D software is able to simulate the processes except for bank erosion. Bank erosion can be added to the model through an application that is under development. The model is very sensitive to the grid cell size, due to the small dimensions of the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> It is advised to decrease the grid cell size and to confine the grid to the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> and the near surroundings as most erosion occurs within this area. The model also experiences problems in the water balance. The problems are caused by the rapid changes in water level, discharge and bottom level, but can be solved by adding and subtracting water to the model. The amount of sediment removed from the reservoir is underestimated. Data for calibration and verification are missing and therefore only the sensitivity to parameters that might increase the erosion is investigated. A measurement plan is set up in order to obtain the required data. The peak concentration is not shown in the model and so the model can not be used properly yet, to simulate different strategies that are implemented to minimize the sediment concentrations. Even though the model does not fully simulate the observed hydrological and morphological changes, it is felt that an important first step is taken in simulating the flushing operations. For the optimisation of the flushing operations a tube system combined with auxiliary channels that drain laterally is recommended. It is desirable to optimize the sediment management of the whole hydropower system in the river Teigitsch and make separate models of the three reservoirs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Gebidem Dam {{located on}} the Massa River {{intercepts}} annually around 400 ’ 000 m 3 of solid material. These sediments must be evacuated by annual flushing of the reservoir over 4 to 7 days. A trend for silting in the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> was observed during the last decades, leading to damageable overtopping of the lateral walls. In order to improve knowledge on input and output of sediments in the channel of Gebidem, physical and numeri-cal modeling was performed in 1994 and in 2002 at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Construc-tions of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). It was clearly demonstrated that the silting process is related to an anti-dunes regime progressing in the upstream direction from deposit zones which develop initially in the curves and the river confluence with Upper Rhone River. At the opposite, the clearing process starts at the upper limit of the channel and progresses by pushing the sediments downstream. The proposed solution requires an addi-tional water supply to be introduced from {{the entrance of the}} channel. In order to optimize the clearing efficiency, the dilution supply can be progressively reduced as soon as the sediment concentration diminishes.

40|$|River {{flood plain}} {{west of the}} city of Vancouver, Washington. The lake and {{surrounding}} watersheds are positioned {{at the base of the}} foothills of the Cascade mountain range to the east and the Pacific Coastal mountain range to the west. The lake is part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion, which extends south into Oregon. Size and Morphology Vancouver Lake is one of several large, shallow lakes in the lower Columbia River floodplain. It may have been formed by a series of Missoula Floods coursing through the Columbia River channel, and then further worked by the river itself with seasonal inundation. Historically, the lake was connected to the Columbia River through Mulligan Slough to the south and Lake River to the north. Diking and filling along the south and west lake shoreline and along the Columbia River shoreline led to the eventual separation of the lake and the river. Major tributaries to the lake include Burnt Bridge Creek, small tributaries along the eastern shore, and intermittently, Lake River, which can flow in or out depending on water levels in the lake relative to the Columbia River. When Lake River flows into the lake it potentially carries water from the Whipple, Salmon, and Flume Creek watersheds. A <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> constructed along the southwest shoreline also acts as an intermittent tributary carrying a significant amount of water from the Columbia River...|$|E

Downstream {{migration}} of European eel at three German hydropower stations. NINA Report 1355 : 53 pages, including appendix. Background and methods The {{aim of this}} study was to examine migration behaviour and losses of European silver eel when passing three run-of-the river hydropower stations in Germany. These were the Unkelmühle power station in the Sieg, the power station in Gengenbach in the Kinzig (both tributaries to the Rhine), and Kuhlemühle power station in the Diemel (tributary to the Weser). The Unkelmühle power station is designed with several bypass routes where fish can pass outside the turbines. At the power station in Gengenbach, the position of a movable turbine can be adjusted to let downstream migrating fish pass above or under the turbine. Narrowly spaced bar racks have been installed in front of the turbine intakes at both Unkelmühle, River Sieg (10 mm), and Gengenbach, River Kinzig (15 mm), to prevent fish from entering the turbines. At the Kuhlemühle power station, River Diemel, an Archimedes screw turbine is installed without a bar rack in front of its entrance. Archimedes screws are regarded as being fish-friendly turbines, but few studies have tested this assumption. The study was performed during 2014 to 2016 by tagging 542 European silver eels with radio transmitters. Their migration in the river and past the power stations was recorded. Results and conclusions Overall, we recorded low mortality for downstream migrating silver eels at these power stations. However, there are uncertainties linked to the survival estimates, particularly at Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle. The mortality of eels when they passed the Unkelmühle power station was 0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 % in the two consecutive study years. This shows that it is possible to obtain low mortalities for downstream migrating eels at run-of-the-river power stations with special protection measures to facilitate migration and reduce mortality. No direct turbine mortality occurred, as no eel slipped through the bar racks in front of the turbines, as expected due to the narrow bar spacing. The reason that we give mortality estimates as a range (0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 %), is that the fate of some tagged eels after passing the Unkelmühle power station is unknown, which makes it difficult to determine if they were alive or dead after passing. Further, three individuals showed movements indicating that they were taken by birds, but it is not known whether they were dead at the power station and taken by bird predators, injured by passing the power station and therefore taken by predators, or whether they were uninjured but taken by predators anyway. The estimates given as ranges take this uncertainty into account, and imply that the mortality at the Unkelmühle power station could have been zero in both study years, but the mortality could also have been up to 4 % in the first study year and up to 8 % in the second year. If there was some mortality linked to passing Unkelmühle power station, this must have been due to injuries occurring in the bypass routes, or increased predation at the power station area. Increased predation may occur if fish are injured and thereby easier prey. It is also possible that presence of injured fish of different species at power stations attracts predators, such that the likelihood of being taken by a predator increases also for uninjured fish. None of the tagged eels became stationary at the power station, indicative of being dead, neither at Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle. However, there are uncertainties for the survival estimates at these power stations, because eels may drift downstream after they are dead. Release of tagged dead eels showed that eels that potentially died when passing Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle could have drifted several kilometers and out of the monitored area below the power stations. Hence, mortality at the power station is in such cases not necessarily detected. The survival estimates at Unkelmühle were more certain, because the fish were tracked over a longer distance below the power station, and implicitly there were fewer individuals with an uncertain fate. Some eels became stationary on river stretches below Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle power stations, and might be dead (14 % and 23 % of the eels that passed the Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle, respectively). However, eels may cease migration and migrate downstream another year, so an eel becoming stationary may not necessarily be dead. Eels mainly used migration routes with a large proportion of the water flow when passing the power stations. At Unkelmühle, most of the downstream migrating eels used the spillway gate, or the bypass route leading fish from the bar racks in front of the turbines into the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> and back to the river via a route outside the turbines. Only two eels used the custom-made side bypasses for eels, and only a small proportion of the eels (< 10 %) used the custom-made bottom bypass at Unkelmühle. At Gengenbach, the largest proportion of eels passed through the section where the moveable turbine was installed, and at Kuhlemühle, the largest proportion passed through the Archimedes screw turbine. A potential negative effect by Archimedes screw turbines may be migration delays. However, most eels migrated fast through the Archimedes screw turbine, and did not hesitate or stop the migration either upstream or downstream of the turbine. In fact, eels migrating through the Archimedes screw turbine or over the dam passed the power station area faster than eels using the other routes. Hence, eels were not markedly delayed in their downstream migration by using the Archimedes screw. However, there was large individual variation, and some individuals spent a long time in passing the power station...|$|E
40|$|Many stream {{restoration}} projects, as part {{of returning}} a degraded ecosystem to a healthier state, aim to restore aquatic invertebrate populations. Unfortunately, many attempts only „beautify‟ streams without achieving improvements in biodiversity. Lack of connectivity of a restoration site to a regional species pool may explain some failures. I tested this by collecting larval and adult aquatic insects from an agriculturally impacted Canterbury high country stream to evaluate connectivity of the regional species pool. The stream was surrounded by high-quality habitat in an adjacent National Park. Surrounding streams contained diverse assemblages of aquatic insects, but processes in the environment and limitations of in-stream habitat meant their adults did not always arrive at the target. In addition, oviposition habitat for hydrobiosid caddisflies was added to sections of stream and compared to un-manipulated control sections to test oviposition site limitation. The addition of oviposition habitat led to more hydrobiosid egg masses in comparison to control reaches. However, oviposition was also limited by in-stream habitat conditions, particularly the abundance of fine sediments. Sedimentation is a common pollutant in streams and is linked to decreases in habitat, food resources, and invertebrate populations. Moreover, common restoration methods, such as riparian management, have little success at reversing already high sediment levels, and are therefore insufficient to bring improvements to in-stream communities or sought-after habitat conditions. Therefore, after determining sediment was restricting sensitive invertebrate recovery at Riversdale Stream, by adding patches of high quality habitat I experimentally compared the factorial effects of sediment <b>flushing</b> and <b>channel</b> narrowing on sediment removal. Treatments improved habitat and prompted recovery of sensitive invertebrates, but an interactive effect where both <b>flushing</b> and <b>channel</b> narrowing combined created the most improved habitat conditions and the greatest improvements of invertebrate communities.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{identify}} the degree and main control of early diagenesis. It was evident that the more porous, channel sandstone units provided a better pathway for fluidflow and were thus subject to a greater degree of meteoric water <b>flushing.</b> The <b>channels</b> sandstones were completely depleted of potassium-feldspar, and had relatively high amounts of kaolinite. It can therefore be assumed that related sandstones at greater depths and temperature would not form illite due to this lack of potassium. The fact that illite cannot form, may enable these deeper sandstones to preserve adequate porosities and permeability for production. Whereas in places where there was an available potassium source, the combination of kaolinite-illite transformation and quartz cementation would have a greater chance of destroying any remaining porosity. In contrast, the crevasse splay sandstone had remaining potassium-feldspar, and overall lower kaolinite fractions. Due to their tendency to pinch-out into a matrix of overbank fines, crevasse splay sandstones do not offer an ideal pathway for fluid-flow, but rather a ‘dead-end’, thus experiencing a lesser degree of meteoric water flushing and leaching of potassium feldspar. It is also evident from the occurrence of both kaolinite and potassiumfeldspar that these units were not buried deep enough (temperature of 130 degrees Celsius) to undergo illitization. Due to substantial quartz overgrowths, we can assume that these units probably experienced a minimum temperature of approximately 80 degrees Celsius (Walderhaug 1994) but {{due to the lack of}} illite (or presence of kaolinite and potassiumfeldspar), we can conclude that it had not been exposed to temperatures equal to or greater than 130 degrees Celsius, for any significant period of time.

40|$|Trimmed lichen {{communities}} (lichen limits) are abrupt {{changes from}} a lichen community to a scoured bare rock surface {{and have been}} used to determine bankfull channel capacity on bedrock channels and their response to the combined disturbances of flow regulation and climate change. They {{can also be used to}} set flushing flows in bedrock channels. In sandstone gorges of the Nepean River, Australia, the crustose lichen, Lecidea terrena Nyl, was common at both gorge and cemetery (sandstone headstones) sites, enabling construction of growth curves for above and below dam areas. Growth curves were used to date lichen colonisation of sandstone surfaces in rivers. The oldest, highest lichen limit at all sites represented the pre-flow regulation lichen community because its characteristics above and below Nepean Dam were similar and were trimmed to a level that produced consistent discharges across a range of catchment areas. They corresponded to return periods of less than 2 years on the annual maximum series and was developed during the flood-dominated regime (FDR) of 1857 – 1900. Lichen limits form by the phycobiont dominating the mycobiont and hence degrading lichen thalli due to water inundation causing weak or dead thalli to be scrubbed from the rock surface. Trimming to the unregulated lichen limit represents a small flood of frequent occurrence appropriate for <b>flushing</b> bedrock <b>channels.</b> A lower lichen limit was only found below a diversion weir and was formed by frequent dam spills between 1950 and 1952 during an extraordinary wet period at the start of the FDR between 1949 and 1990. Lichens colonised exposed sandstone between the level of frequent flows from 1949 to 1952, and the high lichen limit. On the Avon River, an additional lower limit reflected a massive downward shift in flow duration following the start of interbasin diversions to Wollongong in 1962...|$|R

Where use {{has been made of}} the work of others, it is duly acknowledged in the text. 11 The Inanda Dam, situated some 32 to 35 km upstream of the Mgeni River estuary on the Indian Ocean 5 km north of Durban, was constructed between 1984 and 1989. This impoundment deprived the downstream section of a great volume of water and sediment supply, initiating significant downstream changes. This situation is compounded by sand winning which directly extracts about 210, 000 tonnes of sediment from the Lower Mgeni further depriving the estuary of sediment. A 1997 study predicted that assuming a continuous competent discharge and low contribution of sediments from the tributaries, the channel would gradually scour. Other predictions included a reduction in the total sediments reaching the estuary, continued <b>flushing</b> of existing <b>channel</b> sediments downstream towards the estuary, site-specific channel bed erosion at times of peak water release, gradual build up of sediments near the estuary mouth, gradual fining of bed-load channel and estuarine sediments, an...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the Tidal Basin {{originated}} in the 1880s to serve both as a visual centerpiece and {{as a means for}} <b>flushing</b> the Washington <b>Channel,</b> a harbor separated from the Potomac River by fill lands where East Potomac Park is situated. Peter Conover Hains, an engineering officer in the U.S. Army, oversaw the design and construction. The basin was initially named Twining Lake, in honor of Major William Johnson Twining (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), Washington DC's first Engineer Commissioner. According to testimony given to a Congressional subcommittee in 1917, it was Major Twining's idea to create a tidal reservoir and use that water to help [...] "flush" [...] the Washington Channel, and the design was carried out by Colonel Hains. A 1917 Army Corps of Engineers map of Washington already shows the basin with the name [...] "Twining Lake". The Tidal Basin which exists today was not laid out until after World War II. It was built in 1949 by the construction firm of Alexander and Repass, which was unusual at that time because Alexander was of African descent and Repass was of European descent.|$|R
50|$|One of Wyeth's most {{prominent}} early commission was the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge connecting East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park. Both parks were formerly {{part of the}} waters of the Potomac River. Beginning in 1881, material dredged from the river was placed in the tidal flats west and south of the city, creating the western half of the National Mall, the Washington Channel, and the Tidal Basin. The Tidal Basin was designed so that fresh water would flow in via its southern strait, and then flush outward into the Washington Channel. In 1907, the United States Army Corps of Engineers decided that gates were needed at the southern inlet to prevent the basin's water from backflowing into the Potomac (thus ensuring a <b>flush</b> into the <b>channel).</b> The Corps decided that a bridge should be built along with the gates, so that the roadway around the Tidal Basin would make a complete circuit. Wyeth was the only architect considered for the bridge job. His employment was approved in early February 1908, and by early April he'd completed the bridge plans. Although his design for a two-tier bridge was only partially implemented (the top tier was removed for budget reasons), work on the bridge was largely complete by June 1909.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the recovery of}} sediment characteristics in four moraine, headwater streams in north-central Minnesota after forest harvest. We examined changes in fine sediment levels from 1997 (preharvest) to 2007 (10 years postharvest) at study plots with upland clear felling and riparian thinning, using canopy cover, proportion of unstable banks, surficial fine substrates, residual pool depth, and streambed depth of refusal as response variables. Basin-scale year effects were significant (p < 0. 001) for all responses when evaluated by repeated-measures ANOVAs. Throughout the study area, unstable banks increased for several years postharvest, coinciding {{with an increase in}} windthrow and fine sediment. Increased unstable banks may have been caused by forest harvest equipment, increased windthrow and exposure of rootwads, or increased discharge and bank scour. Fine sediment in the channels did not recover by summer 2007, even though canopy cover and unstable banks had returned to 1997 levels. After several storm events in fall 2007, 10 years after the initial sediment input, fine sediment was <b>flushed</b> from the <b>channels</b> and returned to 1997 levels. Although our study design did not discern the source of the initial sediment inputs (e. g., forest harvest, road crossings, other natural causes), we have shown that moraine, headwater streams can require an extended period (up to 10 years) and enabling event (e. g., high storm flows) to recover from large inputs of fine sediment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: An {{outbreak}} of gram-negative bacteremia in patients undergoing {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) was investigated to determine the sources of infection and to control transmission. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia increased from 1. 6 % (60 of 3, 696) procedures to 3. 6 % (53 of 1, 454) procedures (relative risk 2. 3, p < 0. 0001) after endoscopes were processed in a new automated disinfector. Bacteremia involved nine species of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae, which were also isolated from processed endoscopes. Seven epidemic strains with highly related genomic macrorestriction profiles each infected 2 or more patients, accounting for 29 (55 %) episodes of post-ERCP bacteremia. Strains recovered from endoscopes and from the disinfector were associated with 22 (42 %) and 5 (9 %) bacteremic episodes respectively. Effective endoscope disinfection was achieved by cleansing and disinfection of a blind channel not processed in the disinfector, additional isopropanol- air <b>flush</b> of all <b>channels,</b> and auto-disinfection of the disinfector. In the following period, the incidence of post-ERCP bacteremia returned to the pre- epidemic rate (1. 7 %, p = 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Bacterial genome fingerprinting by macrorestriction analysis enabled delineation of a multi-strain {{outbreak of}} post-ERCP bacteremia. Cross-contamination, {{and to a lesser}} extent, common- source contamination, appeared related to inadequate disinfection of endoscopes processed in an automated disinfector.

The stream drains a 2. 25 -km 2 research watershed of which 70 % is underlain by permafrost. Discharge was measured continuously, and specific conductance and total suspended solids concentration were measured at 2 -hour intervals over the entire snowmelt season. Specific conductance decreased rapidly following initial streamflow and after 6 days reached a minimum, which held nearly constant {{for the remainder of}} the snowmelt runoff season. Suspended solids concentration was very low. less than 50 mgn, over the entire rising limb of the seasonal snowmelt hydrograph and, with the exception of a small spike of 166 mg/l on the day of the peak discharge. remained low until the third day following the peak discharge. At that time, although discharge had dropped to 33 % of the peak flow, a rapid <b>flushing</b> of the <b>channel</b> occurred, with solids concentration rising from less than 50 mg/l to 1337 mg/l in a single day. The flushing period lasted four days, during which time diurnal fluctuations in concentration were well defined, with peak values decreasing daily until on the fifth day the peak concentration was under 200 mg/l.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Suspended solids, turbidity and discharge data for thirty-seven reservoir releases, three major periods of dam overspill, and 20 unregulated tributary flood events, on seven different river systems, are analysed {{in order to examine}} suspended solids transport dynamics within regulated rivers and to assess the effectiveness of reservoir releases material. Within Great Britain, two sudden releases of water to the in removing within-channel accumulations of out of every five major reservoirs cause regulated river. Reservoir releases also provide, with their fixed and constant discharges, a unique opportunity to undertake field experiments investigating the importance of channel suspended solids sources, suspended solids supply limitation, the nature of the suspended solids load on turbidity and flow routing within upland boulder bed channels. The reservoir release suspended solids loads relate to sediment source depletion and changing sources along the channel. Close to the· dam, suspended loads are usually small with fine organic matter dominating the seston, which. scanning electron microscopy revealed to be predominantly autochthonous organic matter, with algal fragments derived from extensive and ·rapid periphyton growth within the regulated rivers. Downstream, minerogenic particles dominate the seston. This represents the <b>flushing</b> of <b>channel</b> bed accumulations derived from· unregulated tributaries. Seasonal variation {{in the nature of the}} suspended solids loads is also revealed. The quantity of material transported relates to the relationship between reservoir release or dam overspill frequency and that of unregulated tributary flood events. Marked hysteresis between suspended solids transport and discharge was characteristic on all the regulated rivers. In addition, hysteresis in the relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentrations was also apparent, this relating to spatial and temporal changes in seston composition. Finally, the results obtained allow not only the nature of suspended solids transport within regulated rivers to be described and the effectiveness of reservoir releases for flushing in-channel accumulations of material to be ascertained but also the formulation of management guidelines and recommendations. These guidelines relate to effective environmental management of regulated river habitats in rivers experiencing reservoir releases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Nosocomial {{transmission}} of viral hepatitis and retrovirus infection has been reported. The expected risk is greatest for the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The duck HBV (DHBV) has similar biologic and structural characteristics to HBV {{and has been}} adopted as a suitable model for disinfectant testing. Methods: Angioscopic examination of the external jugular vein was performed on DHBV-infected ducks. After use, the instrument was air dried for 3 minutes. Samples were obtained by <b>flushing</b> the <b>channel</b> with 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline solution. The samples were collected immediately after drying (control), after flushing with 5 mL of water, after glutaraldehyde disinfection for 5, 10, and 20 minutes, and after ethylene oxide gas sterilization. Angioscopes were either precleaned or uncleaned before disinfection/sterilization. Residual infectivity was assessed with inoculation of samples into the peritoneal cavity of day-old ducks (n = 231). Results: DNA analysis results of liver samples showed that all 38 control ducks became infected. The frequency of DHBV infection was reduced to 93 % (14 of 15) by flushing the angioscope with 5 mL of sterile water. No transmission occurred after {{the use of any}} of the properly precleaned and disinfected/sterilized angioscopes. However, after the use of the uncleaned angioscopes, the transmission rate was 90 % (9 of 10) and 70 % (7 of 10) after 5 and 10 minutes of contact time, respectively, in 2 % glutaraldehyde. Even after the recommended 20 minutes of contact time, there was still 6 % (2 of 35) transmission. After ethylene oxide sterilization, two of the recipient ducklings (2 of 35) were infected with DHBV. Conclusion: There was no disease transmission after reuse of disposable angioscopes adequately cleaned before disinfection or sterilization. However, if the angioscopes are inadequately cleaned, DHBV can survive despite glutaraldehyde disinfection or ethylene oxide sterilization. This contrasts with previous in vitro and in vivo data with solid surgical instruments. It is postulated that the presence of a narrow lumen or residual protein shielding within the lumen may compromise effective inactivation of hepadnaviruses on angioscopes, with the potential risk for patient-to-patient transmission.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a common class of problem involving two phase separation of a dispersed gas flow from a continuous liquid flow under extreme processing conditions. Relatively fine spherical bubbles of order 500 µm were generated {{in the presence of}} a surfactant under a high shear rate within a rectangular, multi-channeled, cuboidal downcomer. Liquid fluxes, as high as 176 cm/s through each channel of the downcomer, sheared bubbles from a sintered surface mounted <b>flush</b> to the <b>channel</b> wall before disengaging the downcomer flow into a vertical vessel. Both high feed fluxes, up to 15 cm/s, and high gas fluxes, up to 5. 5 cm/s, ensured a high gas holdup beneath the downcomer and the hindered rising of the bubbles. Enhanced bubble-liquid segregation was achieved using an arrangement of parallel inclined channels incorporated below the main vertical chamber. This novel device, referred to as the Reflux Flotation Cell, prevented the entrainment of bubbles to the underflow, and significantly reduced the liquid flux to overflow, even in the absence of a conventional froth zone. Extreme upward bubble surface fluxes of up to 600 s⁻¹ were achieved, while counter-current downward liquid fluxes reached 14. 4 cm/s, arguably four times the bubble terminal rise velocity. Hence successful phase separation was achieved while operating well beyond the so-called flooding condition arising from extreme levels of gas and feed fluxes. This hydrodynamic arrangement should find application in increasing surfactant extraction rates in foam fractionation and ion flotation, gas absorption, and even particulate flotation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Adaptive {{assessment}} of a riverine system is a continual learning process and probably never reaches a state of full knowledge. Adaptive assessment also includes the principle that continuous adaptation of improved knowledge to the work at hand is the normal state of affairs. The application of adaptive assessment {{presented in this paper}} is a first step in an adaptive process that uses readily available discharge measurement summary data available for some gaging stations to determine the flushing flow needs of a river. The process presented is useful 1) when little money is available for a flushing flow study and 2) in guiding more extensive studies that might be done later in the adaptive process when additional or more detailed information may be needed. In this paper, discharge measurement summary data and limited field data were used to develop a relation between a substrate movement parameter and the discharge for a USGS gage on the Poudre River above Boxelder Creek just downstream from Fort Collins, Colorado. The relation substrate movement parameter was combined with a value of the substrate movement parameter critical for movement of sand and fines known from other studies to find the discharge in the Poudre River in the Fort Collins reach required to flush sand and fines from the river. The discharge- sediment transport parameter relation determined from the analysis is β = 0. 000320 Q ^ 0. 549 where Q is the discharge and β is the substrate movement parameter. From previous studies, the critical value of the substrate movement parameter is 0. 021, resulting in a flushing flow calculated to be 2050 cfs. There are 32 years of record at the Fort Collins gage with 12 years where the <b>channel</b> was <b>flushed</b> and a current run of at least 7 years without <b>flushing</b> of the <b>channel...</b>|$|R
