500|$|Overall, the fossa has {{features}} {{in common with}} three different carnivoran families, leading researchers to place it {{and other members of}} Eupleridae alternatively in <b>Herpestidae,</b> Viverridae, and Felidae. Felid features are primarily those associated with eating and digestion, including tooth shape and facial portions of the skull, the tongue, and the digestive tract, typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet. The remainder of the skull most closely resembles skulls of genus Viverra, while the general body structure is most similar to that of various members of <b>Herpestidae.</b> The permanent dentition is [...] (three incisors, one canine, three or four premolars, and one molar on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the deciduous formula being similar but lacking the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has a large, prominent rhinarium similar to that of viverrids, but has comparatively larger, round ears, almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid. Its facial vibrissae (whiskers) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, particularly Galidia (which is now in the fossa's own family, Eupleridae) and Herpestes (of <b>Herpestidae),</b> it has carpal vibrissae as well. Its claws are retractile, but unlike those of Felidae species, they are not hidden in skin sheaths. It has three pairs of nipples (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).|$|E
500|$|The fossa ( [...] or Malagasy Cryptoprocta ferox) is a cat-like, {{carnivorous}} mammal {{endemic to}} Madagascar. It {{is a member}} of the Eupleridae, a family of carnivorans closely related to the mongoose family (<b>Herpestidae).</b> Its classification has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of cats, yet other traits suggest a close relationship with viverrids (most civets and their relatives). Its classification, along with that of the other Malagasy carnivores, influenced hypotheses about how many times mammalian carnivores have colonized Madagascar. With genetic studies demonstrating that the fossa and all other Malagasy carnivores are most closely related to each other (forming a clade, recognized as the family Eupleridae), carnivorans are now thought to have colonized the island once around 18 to 20 million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hedgehog}} (Erinaceidae), the mongoose (<b>Herpestidae),</b> {{the honey}} badger (Mellivora capensis), the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), {{and a few}} other birds that feed on snakes are known to be immune to a dose of snake venom. Recently the honey badger and domestic pig was found to have convergently evolved amino acid replacements in their nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which are known to confer resistance to alpha-neurotoxins in hedgehogs. Whether the pig may be considered immune is still uncertain, though early studies show endogenous resistance in pigs tested against neurotoxins. Though it has been thought that the pig's subcutaneous layer of fat protects it against snake venom, most venoms pass easily through vascular fat layers, making this unlikely to contribute to its ability to resist venoms. The garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom. [...] Some populations of California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) are at least partially immune to rattlesnake venom as adults.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} of galidiines to other carnivorans {{has historically been}} controversial. Up {{to the middle of}} the 20th century, all smaller feliformians, including members of the current families Viverridae, <b>Herpestidae,</b> and Eupleridae as well as some smaller groups, were classified in the single family Viverridae. Galidiines, which share some characters with both the civets and genets (current Viverridae) and the mongooses (<b>Herpestidae),</b> were allied early on both with the former and the latter, with some going as far as to doubt that they should be placed in a different subfamily than the other mongooses.|$|E
50|$|When the {{classification}} of the mongooses as a family separate from Viverridae gained wide acceptance around 1990, the galidiines were classified {{with them in the}} family <b>Herpestidae,</b> an arrangement supported by cladistic analysis of morphological data. In the early 2000s, molecular phylogenetic inferences, based on data from several genes, provided evidence for a close relationship between galidiines and other Malagasy carnivorans to the exclusion of mainland feliformians. Accordingly, they were all reclassified into a single family, Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses of the family <b>Herpestidae.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In some {{of these}} characters, they {{resemble}} the mongooses (family <b>Herpestidae)</b> of continental Africa and southern Eurasia, {{with which they were}} classified until 2006, and accordingly they are said to be [...] "mongoose-like" [...] or even described as [...] "Malagasy mongooses".|$|E
50|$|The common kusimanse (Crossarchus obscurus), {{also known}} as the long-nosed kusimanse or cusimanse, is a small, diurnal kusimanse or dwarf mongoose.

50|$|A {{recent study}} has finally {{resolved}} the exact position of Ailurus: the red panda {{is neither a}} procyonid nor an ursid, but forms a monotypic family, with the other musteloids as its closest living relatives. The same study also showed that the mustelids are not a primitive family, as was once thought. Their small body size is a secondary trait—the primitive body form of the arctoids was large, not small. Recent molecular studies also suggest that the endemic Carnivora of Madagascar, including three genera usually classed with the civets and four genera of mongooses classed with the <b>Herpestidae,</b> are all descended from a single ancestor. They form a single sister taxon to the <b>Herpestidae.</b> The hyenas are also closely related to this clade.|$|E

50|$|Lukas and Clutton-Brock (2012) {{extensively}} {{discuss this}} association between monogamy and cooperative breeding. Most females provision {{and care for}} their young; however, there are certain species such as mongooses (<b>Herpestidae),</b> New World monkeys (Callitrichidae), and porcupines (Hystrial) that care for their young in assistance of non-breeding helpers. This concept triggers {{the question as to}} why any individuals would take care of offspring other than their own. As described by the study, this social system could be triggered by the non-breeding helpers’ benefit to maximize their fitness by assisting in the rearing of the young.|$|E
50|$|Family <b>Herpestidae</b> (the mongooses, kusimanses, meerkat, etc.) has 32 species. Previously, {{these were}} placed in the family Viverridae. However, Wilson and Reeder (1993) {{established}} the herpestids as morphologically and genetically distinct from viverrids. They are extant in Africa, Middle East and Asia. All have non-retractile claws. They are smaller as a family, ranging from 1 kg (2.2 lb) to 5 kg (11 lb), and typically have long, slender bodies and short legs. Diet varies based on species size and available food sources, ranging from small mammals, birds to reptiles, insects and crabs. Some species are omnivorous, including fruits and tubers in their diet.|$|E
5000|$|The meerkat or {{suricate}} (Suricata suricatta) {{is a small}} carnivoran {{belonging to}} the mongoose family (<b>Herpestidae).</b> It is {{the only member of}} the genus Suricata. Meerkats live in all parts of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, in much of the Namib Desert in Namibia and southwestern Angola, and in South Africa. A group of meerkats is called a [...] "mob", [...] "gang" [...] or [...] "clan". A meerkat clan often contains about 20 meerkats, but some super-families have 50 or more members. In captivity, meerkats have an average life span of 12-14 years, and about half this in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The bushy-tailed {{mongoose}} (Bdeogale crassicauda) is a mammal in {{the family}} <b>Herpestidae</b> found in central Africa, from southern Kenya to central Mozambique. It has dense brown/black fur, short wooly ears, and a plush muzzle. It is often under reported because of its small size, strict nocturnal activity, and elusiveness. This species is not sexually dimorphic in color but there are slight differences in size. Martinoli et al. Tail is wide and bushy, They and their other closely related cousin, the Black- footed mongoose, have large posterior cusps on their p3 tooth. These expanded molars indicate that it is primarily an insectivore, although other carnivorous habits have been documented.|$|E
