5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, <b>fast</b> <b>asleep</b> in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

25|$|But {{the damage}} was already done. Sensing the weakness, Smim Htaw, an ex-monk and a {{half-brother}} of Takayutpi, raised a rebellion {{in the region of}} modern Yangon. Tabinshwehti asked Bayinnaung to suppress the rebellion while he went on a hunting trip to the Irrawaddy delta. It was late January / early February 1550. Unfortunately for the king, the trip was organized by Smim Sawhtut, governor of Sittaung, who planned to assassinate the king and seize the throne. The crew set up camp at Pantanaw where they spent weeks in search of a white elephant, considered extremely auspicious in Burmese tradition. After patiently waiting for nearly three months, Sawhtut finally managed to get his men to guard the king on another hunting trip. On the morning of 30 April 1550, on the king's 34th birthday, two of Sawhtut's swordsmen entered the royal tent and beheaded the king who was <b>fast</b> <b>asleep.</b> The king's severed head and body were left there, and were cremated by a local monk.|$|E

500|$|The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, {{began his}} case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that {{three hours after}} the shootings his nephew {{had told him that}} he [...] "must have done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him {{following}} his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been <b>fast</b> <b>asleep</b> in bed.|$|E

50|$|In {{addressing}} {{sleep disorders}} and possible solutions, {{there is often}} a lot of buzz surrounding melatonin. Research suggests that melatonin is useful in helping people to fall <b>asleep</b> <b>faster</b> (decreased sleep latency), to stay asleep longer, and to experience improved sleep quality. In order to test this, a study was conducted that compared subjects that had taken Melatonin to subjects that had taken a placebo pill in subjects with primary sleep disorders. Researchers assessed sleep onset latency, total minutes slept, and overall sleep quality in the Melatonin and placebo groups to note the differences. In the end, researchers found that melatonin decreased sleep onset latency, increased total sleep time, and improved quality of sleep significantly more than the placebo group.|$|R

But even though I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while before I could adjust myself; being amazed how the creature got thither, and that he should fix about that place; and no where else. But now being assured it could be no other than my honest Poll, my wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perched upon my thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to me with Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did I come here, and where had I been? as if the bird was overjoyed to see me; and so I took him home along with me.|$|R
40|$|Twenty four hour {{oesophageal}} intraluminal pH probe {{studies were}} performed in 114 children (range age: one month- 12 years) referred for symptoms or signs compatible with gastroesophageal reflux. Forty five patients had reflux disease alone, 69 had evidence of oesophagitis which was assessed endoscopically and histologically. Recordings were also performed in 63 control patients. The occurrence of reflux was analysed {{for the total}} study period and particularly while awake, <b>asleep,</b> <b>fasting,</b> and during postcibal periods. Oesophageal acid exposure time {{and the number of}} reflux episodes lasting greater than five minutes during the total study period provided the best discrimination between patients and controls; however, 20 % and 30 % of all reflux patients had both normal (with 2 SD of control) acid exposure time and number of long lasting reflux episodes, respectively. Patients with oesophagitis had significantly more acid reflux than those with simple uncomplicated disease during postcibal, fasting, awake periods, but not during sleep; however, increasing severity of oesophagitis was not associated with increasing acid exposure. The ability of the intraluminal oesophageal pH test to discriminate patients with various degrees of reflux disease decreased if only postprandial pH variables were taken into account. We conclude that: (1) the 24 hour intraoesophageal pH monitoring may present false negative results that limit overall sensitivity of the test; (2) the presence of oesophagitis {{does not seem to be}} associated with increased oesophageal acid exposure during sleep; (3) limiting the pH recording to postprandial periods reduces the discriminatory power of the test...|$|R

40|$|Insulin receptors {{have been}} {{identified}} in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain stem and limbic regions. Binding to the insulin receptor is regulated by the distribution of insulin in the brain, and this by the level of insulin in the peripheral circulation. Studies in animals suggest that insulin modulates a number of different neuronal activities including sleep-awake cycle patterns and satiety. Based on these observations, we hypothesized insulin also had effects on sleep and daytime cognitive performance in humans and that there may be differences between the effect of different insulin species or modes of insulin administration due to their differing time-effect profiles. Thus, we performed a crossover comparison of natural sleep measured by overnight polysomnography (PSG), day-time sleepiness measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), daytime cognitive performance measured by four psychological tests; namely, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, the Grooved Pegboard Test and the Manual Finger Tapping Test, in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) randomized to one-monthly treatments with human R/N insulin, beef/pork R/NPH insulin, beef/pork Iletin R/N insulin, lispro/human ultralente insulin, and continuous subcutaneous (beef/pork Iletin R or lispro) insulin using an insulin pump. They were also compared to eight age-, gender-, and weight-matched non-diabetic healthy control subjects. Our result showed that diabetic patients had a very disrupted sleep, characterized by a 30 % shorter REM onset latency, 30 % less time in SWS and REMS and a high frequency of stage shifts, REMS periods and awakenings after sleep onset. They were also significantly more sleepy during the day on the MSLT. Cognitive performance on psychometric testing was similar to that of non-diabetic controls, but showed significantly greater fluctuation throughout the day. Human R/N insulin-treated diabetics fell <b>asleep</b> <b>faster</b> on both the PSG and MSLT, and had 25 % more REMS time and a better sleep distribution than beef/pork R/NPH insulin-treated diabetics. Conversely, lispro/human ultralente treated diabetics spent more time in stage 1 sleep, and less in REMS. Insulin pumping, particularly with beef/pork insulin increased the duration of REMS and REMS distribution, increased the time to fall asleep on the MSLT, and generally improved overall daytime cognitive function, although the pattern of sleep disruption persisted. Thus, we conclude that insulin has important effects on sleep and daytime performance in humans, and that different insulin have different effects, depending upon their pharmacokinetic profiles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{shift from}} a biphasic to a {{monophasic}} sleep schedule is a fundamental milestone in early childhood. This transition, however, may result in periods of acute sleep loss as children may nap on some but not all days. Although data indicating the behavioral consequences of nap deprivation in young children are accumulating, {{little is known about}} changes to sleep neurophysiology following daytime sleep loss. This study addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the effects of acute nap deprivation on subsequent nighttime sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters in toddlers. Healthy children (n= 25; 11 males; ages 30 – 36 months) followed a strict sleep schedule for ≥ 5 days before sleep EEG recordings performed on 2 non-consecutive days: one after 13 h of prior wakefulness and another at the same clock time but preceded by a daytime nap. Total slow-wave energy (SWE) was computed as cumulative slow-wave activity (SWA; EEG power in 0. 75 – 4. 5 Hz range) over time. Nap and subsequent night SWE were added and compared to SWE of the night after a missed nap. During the night following a missed nap, children fell <b>asleep</b> <b>faster</b> (11. 9 ± 8. 7 min versus 37. 3 ± 22. 1 min;d= 1. 6, p= 0. 01), slept longer (10. 1 ± 0. 7 h versus 9. 6 ± 0. 6 h; d= 0. 7, p< 0. 01) and exhibited greater SWA (133. 3 ± 37. 5 % versus 93. 0 ± 4. 7 %; d= 0. 9, p< 0. 01) compared to a night after a daytime nap. SWE for combined nap and subsequent night sleep did not significantly differ from the night following nap deprivation (12141. 1 ± 3872. 9 μV²*h versus 11, 588 ± 3270. 8 μV²*h; d= 0. 6, p= 0. 12). However, compared to a night following a missed nap, children experienced greater time in bed (13. 0 ± 0. 8 h versus 10. 9 ± 0. 5 h; d= 3. 1, p< 0. 01) and total sleep time (11. 2 ± 0. 8 h versus 10. 1 ± 0. 7 h; d= 1. 4, p< 0. 01). Shorter sleep latency, longer sleep duration, and increased SWA in the night following a missed nap indicate that toddlers experience a physiologically meaningful homeostatic challenge after prolonged wakefulness. Whether toddlers fully recover from missing a daytime nap in the subsequent night necessitates further examination of daytime functioning...|$|R
40|$|Good {{sleep is}} as {{important}} as proper nutrition and exercise. Your body is busy during sleep, repairing wear and tear and getting you in shape for a new day. Without enough sleep, you might experience: 1. Slower reactions, a cloudy mind, or a bad mood. 2. Weakening of body defenses, increasing your risk for infections, high blood pressure, and diabetes. 3. Increased appetite, over eating, and obesity. Driving a truck is a very demanding job. Lack of sleep makes it more difficult {{to meet the demands of}} the job and increases your risk for drowsy driving and vehicle crashes. This could mean the difference between stopping with a vehicle just in front of your bumper, or with it in your seat. Because your 24 / 7 job keeps you on the road for long periods and at night, it can affect your sleep quality. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine along with a good sleep environment can improve your sleep. A good sleep environment improves sleep quality. Your sleep environment may depend on your schedule, but you can improve your sleep environment on the road or at home. 1. Keep safety in mind. Park with a balance of quiet and safety in mind. 2. Block out all light. Close all curtains and truck shades, or use an eye mask. 3. Block out noise. Use ear plugs or a "white noise" machine like a fan to block out noises. Silence phones and assign an audible ringtone to important contacts to minimize distractions. 4. Keep your cab or bedroom temperature cool. People's temperature preferences vary, so keep your room temperature comfortable for you. 5. Get comfortable. You spend one third of your life in bed, so use a comfortable mattress and pillow. Consider upgrading or replacing the mattress in your sleeper if it is old or uncomfortable. Try to get 7 - 9 hours of sleep each day; most people need this amount. Be aware of your body's natural feelings of sleepiness. When you are driving, try to plan your stops and sleep breaks to match your natural sleep times. Sleeping at about the same times every day helps improve sleep. Getting sufficient and regular sleep actually will help you fall <b>asleep</b> <b>faster</b> and sleep better in the future. Better sleep will lead to better health and increased alertness. Remember, any exercise during the day that does not take away from sleep time improves sleep. Avoid before bedtime: 1. Heavy or spicy meals (2 - 3 hours before bed). 2. Liquids (to avoid getting up to use the bathroom), especially alcohol, which causes sleep disturbances. 3. Caffeine (according to your own sensitivity) - this stimulant can help you stay awake while driving, but remember it can affect your body for five hours or more so plan your intake so that it does not prevent you from getting good sleep. 4. Nicotine and other stimulants. 5. Exposure to light from television and electronics (tablets, computers, etc.) - studies show that light from these devices can disturb your sleep. Do before bedtime: 1. Explain to family, friends, and dispatchers the importance of your sleep, when you will be sleeping, and ask them not to disturb you when you are sleeping to minimize disruptions. 2. Driving a truck is a stressful, demanding job. Follow a relaxing routine within an hour or more of bedtime. This will signal to your brain that it is time to sleep. Brushing your teeth, washing your face, and getting undressed for bed will help you relax and fall asleep. NIOSHTIC No. 2004490...|$|R
