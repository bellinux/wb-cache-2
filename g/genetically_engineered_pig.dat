In this study, we aimed to identify potential factors {{in the development of}} thrombocytopenia and CC after <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pig</b> liver transplantation in baboons. Baboons received a liver from either an α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase gene-knockout (GTKO) pig (n =  1) or a GTKO pig transgenic for CD 46 (n =  5) with immunosuppressive therapy. TF exposure on recipient platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs), activation of donor ECs, platelet and EC microparticles, and the IR were monitored. Profound thrombocytopenia and thrombin formation occurred within minutes of liver reperfusion. Within 2  h, circulating platelets and PBMCs expressed functional TF, with evidence of aggregation in the graft. Porcine ECs were negative for expression of P- and E-selectin, CD 106, and TF. The measurable IR was minimal, and the severity and rapidity of thrombocytopenia were not alleviated by prior manipulation of the IR. We suggest that the development of thrombocytopenia/CC may be associated with TF exposure on recipient platelets and PBMCs (but possibly not with activation of donor ECs). Recipient TF appears to initiate thrombocytopenia/CC by a mechanism that may be independent of the IR...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic islet {{transplantation}} {{has been}} a treat-ment option for Type 1 diabetes since 1989. The most notable refinement since then has been {{the implementation of the}} “Edmonton protocol ” in the year 2000 and recently, human islet allo-geneic (allo-) transplantation has attained a his-torical milestone in the USAwith the successful completion of the National Institute of Health (NIH) -funded multicenter clinical trial. With the development of human islet isolation technology, human autologous (auto-) islet transplantation has become a clinical option for prevention of surgical diabetes following total pancreatectomy in chronic pancreatitis patients. Meanwhile, islet xeno-transplantation is developing rapidly in particular characterization of immnunosup-pression regimens, development of islet encap-sulation technology and availability of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pig</b> donors. Despite tremendous progress in areas such as pancreas procurement and preservation, islet cell isola-tion, culture, preservation, new immunosup-pression regimens, and new biological strategies, the clinical use of islet cell based treatment, es-pecially allo- and xeno-transplantation, is lim-ited due to post-transplantation challenges such as the failure of primary engraftment, immune destruction of the islet graft, lifelong need of im-munosuppression, and an unmet need for large numbers of islets. To address these challenges a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing bio-engineering and biologic techniques, are now being applied to islet transplantation. The au-thors have used a bioengineering approach that includes macroencapsulation, microencapsula-tion, and conformal coating (islet surface modi-fication) to protect islet cells. The biologic approach which includes anti-inflammatory /an-ticoagulation was successfully applied to im-prove early engraftment, and insulin-producing cells were generated with stem cell technology. Finally, mesenchymal stem cells were used for induction of immune tolerance and creation of a novel transplantation site. In this review we ex-amine the application of our multidisciplinary approach and how it has contributed to the suc-cess of islet transplantation...|$|E

Since then, the mi-cromanipulation techniques of pig oocytes and embryos expanded from pronuclear injection of foreign DNA to somatic cell nuclear transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection-mediated gene transfer, lentiviral transduction, and cytoplasmic injection.

40|$|Xeno{{transplantation}}, the transplantation {{of living}} organs, tissues, or cells from one species to another, {{is viewed as}} a potential solution to the existing shortage of human organs for transplantation. While whole-organ xenotransplantation is still in the preclinical stage, cellular xenotransplantation and extracorporeal perfusion applications are showing promise in early clinical trials. Advances in immunosuppressive therapy, gene engineering, and cloning of animals bring a broader array of xenotransplantation protocols closer to clinical trials. Despite several potential advantages over allotransplantation, xenotransplantation encompasses a number of problems. Immunologic rejection remains the primary hindrance. The potential to introduce infections across species barriers, another major concern, is the main focus of this review. Nonhuman primates are unlikely to be a main source for xenotransplantation products despite their phylogenetic proximity to humans. <b>Genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs,</b> bred under special conditions, are currently envisaged as the major source. Thus far, there has been no evidence for human infections caused by pig xenotransplantation products. However, the existence of xenotropic endogenous retroviruses and the clinical evidence of long-lasting porcine cell microchimerism indicate the potential for xenogeneic infections. Thus, further trials should continue under regulatory oversight, with close clinical and laboratory monitoring for potential xenogeneic infections...|$|R

Utilizing genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas 9 system allows us to generate <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> at a higher efficiency. In this study, we report generation and phenotypic characterization of IL 2 RG knockout female pigs produced through combination of CRISPR/Cas 9 system and SCNT. As expected, pigs lacking IL 2 RG presented SCID phenotype. Methods First, specific CRISPR/Cas 9 systems targeting IL 2 RG were introduced into developing pig embryos then the embryos were transferred into surrogates. A total of six fetuses {{were obtained from the}} embryo transfer and fetal fibroblast cell lines were established. Then IL 2 RG knockout female cells carrying biallelic genetic modification were used as donor cells for SCNT, followed by embryo transfer. Results Three live cloned female piglets carrying biallelic mutations in IL 2 RG were produced. All cloned piglets completely lacked thymus and they had a significantly reduced level of mature T, B and NK cells in their blood and spleen. Conclusions Here, we generated IL 2 RG knockout female pigs showing phenotypic characterization of SCID.

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> as xenotransplant donors aims {{to solve the}} severe shortage of organs for transplantation in humans. The first barrier to successful xenotransplantation is hyperacute rejection (HAR). HAR is a rapid and massive humoral immune response directed against the pig carbohydrate Galα 1, 3 -Gal epitope, which is 5 synthesized by α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase (α 1, 3 -GT). The Galα 1, 3 -Gal antigen also contributes to subsequent acute vascular rejection events. Genetic modifications of donor pigs transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or different glycosyltransferases to downregulate Galα 1, 3 -Gal expression {{have been shown to}} significantly delay xenograft rejection. However, the complete removal of the Galα 1, 3 -Gal antigen is the most attractive option. In this study the 10 5 end of the α 1, 3 -GT gene was efficiently targeted with a nonisogenic DNA construct containing predominantly intron sequences and a Kozak translation initiation site to initiate translation of the neomycin resistance reporter gene. We developed two novel PCR screening methods to detect and confirm the targeted G 418 -resistant clones.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{temporary}} {{or long-term}} xenotransplantation of pig organs into people would save {{thousands of lives}} each year {{if not for the}} robust human antibody response to <b>pig</b> carbohydrates. <b>Genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> deficient in galactose α 1, 3 galactose (gene modified: GGTA 1) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (gene modified: CMAH) have significantly improved cell survival when challenged by human antibody and complement in vitro. There remains, however, a significant portion of human antibody binding. METHODS: To uncover additional xenoantigens, we compared the asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycome from serum proteins of humans, domestic pigs, GGTA 1 knockout pigs, and GGTA 1 /CMAH knockout pigs using mass spectrometry. Carbohydrate structures were determined with assistance from GlycoWorkbench, Cartoonist, and SimGlycan software by comparison to existing database entries and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation data. RESULTS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis of reduced and solid-phase permethylated glycans resulted in the detection of high-mannose, hybrid, and complex type N-linked glycans in the 1000 - 4500 m/z ion range. GGTA 1 /CMAH knockout pig samples had increased relative amounts of high-mannose, incomplete, and xylosylated N-linked glycans. All pig samples had significantly higher amounts of core and possibly antennae fucosylation. CONCLUSIONS: We provide {{for the first time a}} comparison of the serum protein glycomes of the human, domestic pig, and genetically modified pigs important to xenotransplantation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{generated}} <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> {{expressing the}} human dominant GUCY 2 DE 837 D/R 838 S allele to modelize cone dystrophy. After a functional follow-up showing reduced photopic ERG responses (ARVO 2011), we analyzed the eyes by immunohistochemistry and revealed retinal modifications in the transgenic group. Methods: Lentiviral vectors encoding the human double mutant GUCY 2 DE 837 D/R 838 S cDNA {{under the control}} of a portion of the pig arrestin- 3 promoter (Arr 3) were produced and used for lentiviral-mediated transgenesis in pigs. Animals were regularly submitted to behavioral and functional investigations and were sacrificed at 4, 7, 15 and 18 months of age for histological and RT-PCR analyses. Retinal markers were used to evaluate the retinal status of eleven transgenic pigs and 6 non-transgenic controls. The expression of the mutant cDNA was also assayed by RT-PCR. Results: A significant {{increase in the number of}} displaced nuclei in the outersegment layer is observed in transgenic animals compared to control animals independently of their age. Part of these nuclei originate from cones as demonstrated by colocalization with cone markers. No significant change in the ONL thickness (central and peripheral retina) was measured between 4 and 18 months of age, showing a slow progression of the disease in the transgenic pigs within this time-frame. Conclusions: Arr 3 -GUCY 2 DE 837 D/R 838 S pigs show signs of retinal abnormality with slow progression which parallels the loss of photopic function.

40|$|<b>Genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> are {{increasingly}} recognized as valuable {{models for the}} study of human disease. Immunohistochemical study of cellular markers of disease is an important tool for the investigation of these novel models so as to evaluate genotype and treatment differences. Even so, there remains a lack of validated markers for pig tissues that can serve as a translational link to human disease in organs such as the lung. Herein, we evaluate markers of cellular inflammation (cluster of differentiation [CD] 3, CD 79 a, B cell lymphoma [BCL] 6, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule [IBA] 1, and myeloperoxidase) and those that may be involved with tissue remodeling (alpha-smooth muscle actin, beta-tubulin-III, lactoferrin, mucin [MUC] 5 AC, MUC 5 B, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]) for study of lung tissues. We compare the utility of these markers between pig and human lungs to validate translational relevance of each marker. Our results suggest these markers can be a useful addition in the pathological evaluation of porcine models of human disease.

40|$|Xenotransplantation holds {{promise to}} solve the ever {{increasing}} shortage of donor organs for allotransplantation. In the last 2 decades, major {{progress has been made}} in understanding the immunobiology of pig-into-(non) human primate transplantation and today we are on the threshold of the first clinical trials. Hyperacute rejection, which is mediated by pre-existing anti-alphaGal xenoreactive antibodies, can in non-human primates be overcome by complement- and/or antibody-modifying interventions. A major step forward was the development of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs,</b> either transgenic for human complement regulatory proteins or deficient in the alpha 1, 3 -galactosyltranferase enzyme. However, several other immunologic and nonimmunologic hurdles remain. Acute vascular xenograft rejection is mediated by humoral and cellular mechanisms. Elicited xenoreactive antibodies play a key role. In addition to providing B cell help, xenoreactive T cells may directly contribute to xenograft rejection. Long-term survival of porcine kidney- and heart xenografts in non-human primates has been obtained but required severe T and B cell immunosuppression. Induction of xenotolerance, e. g. through mixed hematopoietic chimerism, may represent the preferred approach, but although proof of principle has been delivered in rodents, induction of pig-to-non-human primate chimerism remains problematic. Finally, it is now clear that innate immune cells, in particular macrophages and natural killer cells, can mediate xenograft destruction, the determinants of which are being elucidated. Chronic xenograft rejection is not well understood, but recent studies indicate that non-immunological problems, such as incompatibilities between human procoagulant and pig anticoagulant components may play an important role. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the currently known obstacles to xenografting: immune and non-immune problems are discussed, as well as the possible strategies that are under development to overcome these hurdles.

40|$|Organ {{transplantation}} {{is limited}} by the number of cadaveric human donor organs that become available. Xenotransplantation - the transplantation of organs and tissues between animal species - would supply an unlimited number of organs and offer many other advantages. The pig has been identified as the most suitable donor animal. Pig organs, when transplanted into humans or nonhuman primates, are, however, rejected hyperacutely within minutes by antibody-mediated complement activation. Human anti-pig antibodies have been identified as being directed against galactose alpha 1 - 3 galactose (alpha Gal) epitopes on pig vascular endothelium. Methods have been successfully developed to prevent hyperacute rejection. These include (i) depletion or inhibition of recipient antibodies or complement and (ii) development of transgenic pigs that express a human complement-regulatory protein (e. g. hDAF). The persistence or return of anti-pig antibody, however, even following the use of hDAF pig organs, eventually leads to what has been variously termed "acute vascular rejection" or "delayed xenograft rejection", which is again believed to be largely antibody-dependent. Nevertheless, experimental pig-to-primate organ xenotransplantation now results in transplant function for days and weeks rather than minutes. Little is yet known {{of the nature of the}} acute cellular rejection response that is anticipated to follow, and of any subsequent chronic rejection that may develop. Tolerance to both the alpha Gal epitope and to swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) is being explored using gene therapy techniques and by the induction of hematopoietic cell chimerism. The development of <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> that do not express the alpha Gal epitope is also being pursued.

Type 1 diabetes {{can be treated}} successfully by islet allotransplantation, the results of which are steadily improving. However, the number of islets that {{can be obtained from}} deceased human donors will never be sufficient to cure more than {{a very small percentage of}} patients who might benefit from transplantation. Although there are some differences in glucose metabolism between pigs and humans, the use of pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets, and the insulin produced would undoubtedly control glucose levels. Transplantation of islets into the portal vein results in islets residing in the liver; however, an early inflammatory response and rejection remain problematic, even when the recipient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. In the long term, immunosuppressive drugs may exhibit toxicities to patients and specifically harm the islet cells. In contrast, encapsulation techniques provide islets with a physical barrier that prevents antibodies binding to the islet graft while still allowing insulin to be released into the recipient&# 39;s circulation; in theory, patients receiving encapsulated grafts might not require exogenous immunosuppressive therapy. Nonhuman primates with encapsulated pig islet transplants have remained insulin-independent for several weeks, but long-term efficacy remains uncertain. Furthermore, techniques are now available to knock out genes from the pig and/or insert human genes, thus rendering the antigenic structure of pigs closer to that of humans, and providing protection from the human immune response. Islet transplantation from <b>genetically</b> <b>engineered</b> <b>pigs</b> has been followed by insulin independence in a small number of nonhuman primates for greater than 1 year. Neonatal islets have some advantages over adult islets in that they are easier to isolate and culture, and have the ability to proliferate during the first few months after transplantation. In 2009, the International Xenotransplantation Association set up a group to encourage and advise on clinical trials of pig islet xenotransplantation; this group&# 39;s guidelines are discussed.
