5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son</b> extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son</b> instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E

5|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{states that}} King William called upon the King of Mann, Ragnald Guthredsson, {{to fight against}} Harald. Rognvald had {{possibly}} spuriously claims to Harald's lands, because people remembered that Harald's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson, whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man (although Ragnald's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady's stepson and not <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son).</b> Harald, however, retook Caithness at this time. In this campaign, dated to 1201, the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness, at Scrabster. Bishop John went to meet Harald, apparently to greet him, but the Earl had him seized, tortured and mutilated. The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his Res Gestae Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son</b> and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship {{and the notion of}} a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was {{the eldest}} son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) and his second wife Sarah–Theodora, a Jew {{converted}} to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought {{up the issue of}} the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor to the throne and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession to the throne. However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once more. It is likely that Sarah–Theodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son</b> as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have come next under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter was born in the purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor.|$|E

5000|$|In 1930, Rayner's {{first article}} written without Watson, [...] "I Am the Mother of a Behaviorist's Son", was published.

5|$|The {{death of}} the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the {{emergence}} of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sherjung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, nobody could rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.|$|E
25|$|Dehn {{was skeptical}} about the holiness of the starets in making Grigori Rasputin and the Tsarina's {{reliance}} upon him, but wrote that Rasputin once prayed over <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> Titi, when the child was dangerously ill and the boy made a quick recovery.|$|E
25|$|However, not {{all members}} of the royal family were {{dissatisfied}} with Peter's mesalliance and subsequent loss of dynastic rights. His aunt, Princess Andrew, was glad to see him excluded from the line of succession because it brought <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> Prince Philip (later Duke of Edinburgh), closer to the throne.|$|E

25|$|King Kaumualii paid Captain James Rowan of the American trading ship Hazard to {{take his}} son aboard, ostensibly to get an {{education}} in America.

50|$|According to some Byzantine sources Milutin did {{not wait}} until Simonida reached {{maturity}} before consummating their relationship, causing damage to her uterus and preventing her from ever carrying children. When this became known, Empress Irene, who was Andronikos II's second wife and {{had hoped to}} use the Serbian marriage to advance <b>her</b> <b>own</b> progeny, then offered Milutin to adopt one of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons</b> as his heir.|$|R
50|$|They {{had been}} beaten and starved, and finally sold at Caesarea Stratton to Justa, who had educated them as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons.</b> Later they had adhered to Simon, but were brought by Zacchaeus to Peter.

50|$|According to chronicles, Euphrosyne {{wished for}} her sons to inherit {{the lands of}} their father, but they would not inherit because of their two elder half-brothers. Euphrosyne wanted to poison her two stepsons so that <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons</b> could inherit Casimir's lands. This plot would explain a revolt of the two boys against their father, Casimir.|$|R
25|$|Gosse {{was born}} in Worcester in 1810 of an {{itinerant}} painter of miniature portraits and a lady's maid.

25|$|On November 21, 2006, The Smoking Gun exposed pending {{litigation}} {{on behalf of}} the estate of Melinda Duckett, asserting a wrongful death claim against CNN and Grace. The attorney for the estate alleges that, even if Duckett did kill <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> Grace's aggressive questioning traumatized Duckett so much that she committed suicide. She also argues that CNN's decision to air the interview after Duckett's suicide traumatized her family. Trenton has never been found.|$|E

5|$|Though {{usually made}} to {{strengthen}} {{the position of the}} empire, there are examples of interdynastic marriages destabilising the emperor's authority. When Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos married his second wife, Eirene of Montferrat, in 1284 she caused a division in the Empire over her demand that <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons</b> share in imperial territory with, Michael, his son from his first marriage. She resorted to leaving Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, and setting up <b>her</b> <b>own</b> court in the second city of the Empire, Thessalonica.|$|R
25|$|In {{his book}} The Myth of Male Power, author Warren Farrell {{suggested}} that Laurie Dann's actions were {{an example of}} women's violence against men. He claimed, erroneously, that all of Dann's victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son,</b> and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Men's rights activists, academics, and the media have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.|$|E

25|$|However, Maria Luisa refused this {{compromise}} {{for more}} than two years. During this time, she lived with her children in a Roman palace. Family relationships became strained: her parents and her brother Ferdinand VII wanted to marry Maria Luisa's daughter, Maria Luisa Carlota, then fourteen years old, to Francisco de Paula, Maria Luisa's youngest brother. She opposed this plan, considering her brother (eight years older than her young daughter) to be too reckless. She also rejected a proposed plan for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>son</b> to marry Maria Cristina of Naples, a daughter of her sister Maria Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons,</b> Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|R
