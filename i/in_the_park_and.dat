5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> {{two to four}} females have cubs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears {{can also be found}} in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, American mink and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of the established and popular activity of mountain biking in the greater Adelaide area, and to better accommodate the mountain biking community in the north eastern suburbs, it was proposed in 2006 to permit cycling in designated zones on purpose-built tracks and on certain management tracks within the park. The intention is to satisfy both biodiversity and recreation objectives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> reducing the incidence of illegal mountain bike riding in other non designated areas.|$|E
5|$|More than 16 {{kinds of}} lizards and snakes live in various {{habitats}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> consume {{large quantities of}} insects, spiders, scorpions, other reptiles, and small mammals. The collared lizard, which occurs in every habitat, is {{the largest and most}} often seen. Plateau striped whiptails, a species consisting entirely of females, prefer grasslands and developed areas. Side-blotched lizards live in rocky areas of the park but are seldom seen. Gopher snakes, which sometimes imitate rattlesnakes when disturbed, are among the most common snakes in the park. The Western rattlesnake, the only venomous snake found in the park, prefers grasslands and shrub areas.|$|E
5|$|Moses {{also made}} {{improvements}} to the park itself, building new walkways, paving dirt roads, creating playgrounds, and installing lights. Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 {{on the site of}} a former swamp, and a pool followed in 1970. Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods. During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality. For instance, six mothers were issued court summonses in 1942 after letting their children dig <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings.|$|E

The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Prominent theatre {{companies}} in Oklahoma include, {{in the capital}} city, Oklahoma City Theatre Company, Carpenter Square Theatre, Oklahoma Shakespeare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Park,</b> <b>and</b> CityRep.

5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on the sediment caused the formation of the rocks that are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.|$|E

5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed granitic {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park)</b> <b>and</b> mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has many}} {{activities}} open to visitors and residents, some {{maintained by the}} city, others are spontaneously set up by individuals. Washington Park's open spaces are often used by visitors to play boccie, volleyball, and badminton games. Tennis, basketball, and handball courts are maintained by the city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> ice skating is permitted on Washington Park Lake, though swimming is prohibited. Bicycling is popular on the many roadways, {{many of which are}} closed to vehicular traffic. Though skateboarding is legal throughout the park itself, the monuments and ball courts in the park fall under a citywide ban on skateboarding on public monuments, statues, and tennis/basketball courts.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

5|$|Contracted {{through the}} National Park Service, various {{concessionaire}} entities manage lodging facilities inside the park. The largest such facility is the Jackson Lake Lodge, which is {{managed by the}} Grand Teton Lodge Company. Located near Jackson Lake Dam, the Jackson Lake Lodge has a total of 385 rooms, meeting facilities, a retail shop and a restaurant. The Grand Teton Lodge Company also manages the Jenny Lake Lodge, which consists of cabins and a restaurant and Colter Bay Village, which has cabins, a restaurant, a grocery store, a laundry and a marina. South of Jackson Lake Dam, the Signal Mountain Lodge is managed by Forever Resorts and provides cabins, a marina, a gas station and a restaurant. The American Alpine Club has hostel dormitory style accommodations primarily reserved for mountain climbers at the Grand Teton Climber's Ranch. Adjacent to the Snake River in Moose, Wyoming, Dornan's is an inholding on private land which has year-round cabin accommodations and related facilities. Lodging is also available at the Triangle X Ranch, another private inholding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> the last remaining dude ranch within park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>and</b> {{some of these are}} lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>and</b> are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{investigation}} on tree species within plant communities of <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> gardens in Hangzhou West Lake Scenic Area, some indices such as species composition, importance value, application frequency, diameter class structure, health condition, and seasonal aspect structure of woody plants were calculated. The present situation and contributing factors of utilization of the tree species resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> gardens of <b>the</b> West Lake were analyzed, and some corresponding suggestions were proposed. The results were as follows: 1) There were 166 species of woody vascular plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> gardens of <b>the</b> West Lake, which belonged to 58 families and 108 genera. Compared with zonal plant species in Hangzhou and landscape plants in advanced foreign cities, the plant species number was very low. 2) About 30 species had high important value and application frequency. It indicated that the arbor and shrub species in each community <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> gardens of <b>the</b> West Lake was small at present. 3) The results of study of diameter class structure showed that, the average breast-height diameter of trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Lake was 34 cm, and about 67 % trees had 20 - 40 cm breast-height diameter. It indicated {{that a majority of}} trees were mature. 4) The results of study of health status showed that, most plant species developed well. 5) The results of study of seasonal aspect showed that, <b>the</b> plant landscape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>and</b> gardens of <b>the</b> West Lake had different characteristics in different seasons, which were numerous flowers in spring, green shades in summer, colorful leaves in autumn and beautiful branches and trunks in winter...|$|R
