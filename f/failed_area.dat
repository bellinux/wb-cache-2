Differently {{from the present}} prevailing fabrication process of silicon piezoresistive pressure sensor: platinum is used as the sensing material, with a smaller but acceptable sensitivity and much simpler processes; adhesive bonding with SU- 8 is used as an alternative choice to anodic bonding, and we choose a vacuum hot plate to avoid using a bonding machine. To achieve a successful bonding, {{it is found that}} pre-bake time and pumping time are the most important factors. Bonding quality is evaluated by inspection through the glass with 95 % of the area successfully bonded and the <b>failed</b> <b>area</b> in the edge of the wafers. The measured bonding strength is 17. 34 MPa. The Pressure-Voltage characteristic test results display a good linearity within 0. 2 % and especially a good precision within 0. 035 % in square fitting. The temperature drifting is also tested and the TCO is 1250 ppm/(°C FSO). The long-term stability of the sensor at a constant pressure is a fluctuation within 40 Pa (0. 098 % FSO) in 7 days. Both the simple fabrication process and the excellent performance of the sensor suggest that this sensor is a much good choice in measuring atmospheric pressure. ...|$|E

40|$|Nearly 110 km of {{high-resolution}} multichannel seismic {{data from}} the Romanian Black Sea reveal slope failures and paleo canyons of the Danube deep-sea fan. The new data allow detailed investigation of a submarine landslide identified during a regional seismic and multibeam bathymetric survey. The landslide scar has a dimension of 3 x 2. 5 km and covers an area of about 8 km². The volume of the mobilized material is estimated to approximately 0. 36 km³. Based on average sedimentation rates in the Danube deep-sea fan, age of the landslide {{is estimated to be}} around 12 ka. The absence of deposits {{at the foot of the}} landslide and the vicinity of the paleo canyon suggest that the material removed during the slide event was drained through the paleo canyon. We observe an upward bending bottom simulating reflector (BSR) beneath and active gas expulsion from the seafloor encircling the landslide scar. The water depth of the slide area correlates with the upper limit of hydrate stability. Modeling the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ) for the paleo-water conditions during the last glacial maximum (LGM) reveals an upward bending trend. The modeled BGHSZ for LGM crops out in the vicinity of the headwall of the landslide whereas the present day BSR crops out at the foot of the <b>failed</b> <b>area.</b> Therefore, we propose that warming of the Black Sea might have caused dissociation of gas hydrates resulting in building increased sediment pore pressure, possibly triggering the landslide identified in our data...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{different}} components factor {{into the}} final grade assigned for the internal medicine clerkship. Failure {{of one or more}} of these requires consideration of remedial measures. Purpose: To determine which assessment components are used to assign students a passing grade for the clerkship and what remediation measures are required when students do not pass a component. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey of Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) institutional members was conducted in April 2011. The survey included sections on remediation, grading practices, and demographics. The authors analyzed responses using descriptive and comparative statistics. Results: Response rate was 73 % (86 / 113). Medicine clerkships required students to pass the following components: clinical evaluations 83 (97 %), NBME subject exam 76 (88 %), written assignments 40 (46 %), OSCE 35 (41 %), in-house written exam 23 (27 %), and mini-CEX 19 (22 %). When students failed a component of the clerkship for the first time, 55 schools (64 %) simply allowed students to make up the component, while only 16 (18 %) allowed a simple make-up for a second failure. Additional ward time was required by 24 schools (28 %) for a first-time failure of one component of the clerkship and by 49 (57 %) for a second failure. The presence or absence of true remedial measures in a school was not associated with clerkship director academic rank, grading scheme, or percent of students who failed the clerkship in the previous year. Conclusions: Most schools required passing clinical evaluations and NBME subject exam components to pass the medicine clerkship, but there was variability in other requirements. Most schools allowed students to simply re-take the component for a first-time failure. This study raises the question of whether true remediation is being undertaken before students are asked to re-demonstrate competence in a <b>failed</b> <b>area</b> of the clerkship to be ready for the subinternship level...|$|E

40|$|ODMRP (On-Demand Multicast Routing Proto-col) [5] [7] [1] is {{a popular}} {{multicast}} protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. The strengths of ODMRP are simplicity, high packet delivery ratio, and non-dependency on a specific unicast protocol. ODMRP floods a route request over the entire network to select a set of forwarding nodes for packet delivery. However, a single forwarding path is vulnerable to node failures, which are common due to the dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks. Further-more, a set of misbehaving or malicious nodes can create network partitions and mount Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We propose a ODMRP-based wireless multicast protocol named Resilient-ODMRP that offers more reliable forwarding paths in face of node and network failures. A subset of the nodes that are not on forwarding paths re-broadcast received packets to nodes in their neighborhoods to overcome perceived node failures. This rebroadcasting creates redundant forwarding paths to circumvent <b>failed</b> <b>areas</b> in the network. Each node makes this forwarding decision probabilistically. Our simulation results indicate that Resilient-ODMRP improves packet delivery ratio with minimal overheads, while retaining the original strengths of ODMRP. 1...|$|R

40|$|Life {{predictions}} of regeneratively cooled rocket thrust chambers are normally derived from classical material fatigue principles. The failures observed in experimental thrust chambers {{do not appear}} to be due entirely to material fatigue. The chamber coolant walls in the <b>failed</b> <b>areas</b> exhibit progressive bulging and thinning during cyclic firings until the wall stress finally exceeds the material rupture stress and failure occurs. A preliminary analysis of an oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper cylindrical thrust chamber demonstrated that the inclusion of cumulative cyclic plastic effects enables the observed coolant wall thinout to be predicted. The thinout curve constructed from the referent analysis of 10 firing cycles was extrapolated from the tenth cycle to the 200 th cycle. The preliminary OFHC copper chamber 10 -cycle analysis was extended so that the extrapolated thinout curve could be established by performing cyclic analysis of deformed configurations at 100 and 200 cycles. Thus the original range of extrapolation was reduced and the thinout curve was adjusted by using calculated thinout rates at 100 and 100 cycles. An analysis of the same underformed chamber model constructed of half-hard Amzirc to study the effect of material properties on the thinout curve is included...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} finite element {{simulation}} of low velocity-low energy impacts on sandwich composites with laminated faces. A refined zig-zag {{model with a}} high-order piecewise representation of in-plane and transverse displacement components {{is used as a}} structural model in order to accurately simulate the effects of the transverse normal stress and strain. The goal is to develop a tool for improving the accuracy of conventional plate models, so as to enable the impact analysis of sandwich composites. A strain energy updating process is used for this purpose. As is customary, the Hertzian law and the Newmark implicit time integration scheme are used. The contact radius is computed within each load step by an iterative algorithm, which forces the impacted top surface to conform, in the least-squares sense, to the shape of the impactor. Then, the failure analysis is performed and the material properties of the <b>failed</b> <b>areas</b> reduced. Nonlinear strains of von Karman type are used because the transverse displacement can be quite large even when the plate deflection is small. Comparison with numerical and experimental results published in literature show the present model to be able to accurately predict the impact force and the damage it induce...|$|R

40|$|The Arctic changes {{rapidly in}} {{response}} to global warming {{and is expected to}} change even faster in the future (IPCC 2001, 2007, 2013). Large areas of the shelves and continental slopes bordering the Arctic Ocean are characterized by permafrost and the presence of gas hydrates. Future global warming and potential hydrate dissociation in the Arctic Ocean challenge the slope stability of these areas. This may lead to slope failures. The first, and so far only reported, large-scale slope failure in the Arctic Ocean is the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide (HYM), which is located in front of the Hinlopen glacial trough north of Svalbard. During cruise MSM 31 onboard the German R/V MARIA S. MERIAN we investigated this giant slope failure and the deeper structure of the Sophia Basin in detail to elucidate the potential causes of the main and following failure events as well as to test existing hypotheses on the generation of this giant submarine landslide. We studied the megaslide and the adjacent so far not <b>failed</b> shelf <b>areas</b> by means of multibeam swath bathymetry, Parasound sediment echo sounder, low- and high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection profiling. The seismic data image bottom-simulating reflectors beneath not <b>failed</b> <b>areas</b> of the slope, as well as a buried gas escape pipe. On the shelf, shallower than the gas hydrate stability zone, we observed widespread gas seepage as flares in the Parasound echo sounder data. These flares rise from a seafloor highly disturbed by iceberg scouring. Therefore, we could not identify pockmarks in the multibeam data. At one location, we sampled a flare by means of a CTD probe close to the seafloor and proofed that the emanating gas has a high methane concentration. The new data indicate that the existence of gas and gas hydrates beneath the shelf north of Svalbard was one key factor causing slope instability in the past and may also cause further slope failures in the future...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{infrared}} (IR) thermographic procedure was evaluated as a non-destructive testing tool to detect damage in thermal spray metallic coatings. As model systems, polished HVOF- and HVAF-sprayed Fe-based layers deposited onto steel plates were employed. Damage by external-object impingement was simulated through a cyclic impact-test apparatus, which induced circumferential and radial cracks across all model systems, and interface cracks {{of different sizes}} in distinct samples. Damaged and undamaged plates were bulk-heated to above 100 °C using an IR lamp; their free-convection cooling was then recorded by an IR thermocamera. The intentionally induced defects were hardly detectable in IR thermograms, due to IR reflection and artificial ‘‘hot’’ spots induced by residuals of transfer material from the impacting counterbody. As a micrometer-thin layer of black paint was applied, surface emissivity got homogenized and any artifacts were effectively suppressed, so that <b>failed</b> coating <b>areas</b> clearly showed up as ‘‘cold spots. ’’ This effect was more apparent when large interface cracks occurred. Finite-element modeling proved the physical significance of the IR-thermography approach, showing that <b>failed</b> coating <b>areas</b> are cooled by surrounding air faster than they are heated by conduction from the hot substrate, {{which is due to}} the insulating effect of cracks...|$|R
40|$|Granule {{capability}} {{is defined in}} terms of the strength of individual granule and friability of granulation batch to withstand breaking, abrasion and compactibility. Binder(s) are added to perform the above properties. The common methods to asses their capability are to test crushing strength of the granules directly and to make statistical analysis and /or testing the friability of bulk granulation. In this work four substrate models including polymethylmetacrylate beads(PMMA),glass powder, acetaminophen, and para-aminobebzoic acid were chosen. The binder models were corn starch, gelatin, methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). After massing the substrates with the binder solutions, discs were produced by the mean of the mold technique. The discs were dried and conditioned and then tested for tensile strength while the <b>failed</b> <b>areas</b> were scanned by SEM. Various granulations were made and the results of friability and crush strength were compared with the discs strength. The bond areas in the SEM showed the trend with the binder concentration. A comparison of the standard deviation shows that discs have much lower level of the strength than granules. The resulting discs showed a higher performance which is related to the stems for the discs shape. In conclusion, this method is a simple and is applicable to differentiate efficacy of binder under studies...|$|R
