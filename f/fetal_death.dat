5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual <b>fetal</b> <b>death,</b> necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E

The goal of present work was to determine incidence of the <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> and sex ratio among progenies of workers in operating rooms in hospitals. Results of pregnancies of spouses of all male workers and also pregnancies of female workers {{of operating}} rooms in hospitals in Hamadan, Iran, were studied. Total of pregnancies were 200 cases. In a cross-sectional descriptive investigation, the results of all pregnancies of two subject groups were studied for frequencies of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> (abortions + stillbirths) and sex ratios of progenies and then statistically compared {{with each other and}} with general population. The basic primary data were collected by face-to-face interviews and by employing suitable questionnaires.

40|$|Objectives—This report {{presents}} 2013 fetal and {{perinatal mortality}} data by maternal age, marital status, race, Hispanic origin, and state of residence, {{as well as}} by fetal birthweight, gestational age, plurality, and sex. Trends in fetal and perinatal mortality are also examined. Methods—Descriptive tabulations of data are presented and interpreted. Results—A total of 23, 595 <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> at 20 weeks of gestation or more were reported in the United States in 2013. The U.

The lack of decline in fetal mortality in recent years, coupled with declines in infant mortality, meant that more <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> than infant deaths occurred in the United States for 2011 – 2013 (although the rates were essentially the same). In 2013, the fetal mortality rate for non-Hispanic black women (10. 53) was more than twice the rate for non-Hispanic white (4. 88) and Asian or Pacific Islander (4. 68) women. The rate for American Indian or Alaska Native women (6. 22) was 27 % higher, and the rate for Hispanic women (5. 22) was 7 % higher, than the rate for non-Hispanic white women.

25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or <b>fetal</b> <b>death.</b> Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
500|$|Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis and complications during pregnancy, often leading to <b>fetal</b> <b>death.</b> [...] It {{is caused by}} the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). The anti-β2GPI antibodies are most prevalent in causing the symptoms of the disease. When bound by an antibody, β2GPI begins to interact with monocytes, endothelial cells, and platelets. ApoER2 is thought to {{play a key role in}} the process of platelet binding. β2GPI has the proper binding site for interaction with ApoER2 and other LDL family receptors, and it is speculated that the antibody/β2GPI complexes interact with ApoER2 on platelets. [...] This causes the phosphorylation of a p38MAPkinase, resulting in the production of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 functions to activate more platelets, and this leads to a greater chance for blood clots to form. There is also speculation that the antibody/β2GPI complexes sensitize other cell types through various LDL family receptors to lead to less common symptoms other than thrombosis.|$|E

40|$|Fundamentals: <b>Fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> {{is not a}} rare occurrence. Epidemiological {{and risk}} factors and its {{prevalence}} in several populations, as they are studied may improve obstetrical and neonatal assistance. Objectives: Our purpose is to know the frequency, analyze and to classify the cases of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> which have occurred at the University of Northern Paraná (HURNP) within the period of 4 (four) years, from 1997 to 2000. It is also our purpose to verify epidemiological aspects and investigation methods of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths,</b> and compare the data with existing literature. Methods: In the descriptive study all the occurrences of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> in the HURNP within the period of 4 (four) years were restrospectively reviewed, {{the data were collected}} from medical reports and submitted to statistical analysis by means of the EPI INFO program. Results: 97 cases of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> were identified in the period of 4 (four) years in the HURNP, with pregnancy period of 20 (twenty) weeks or more, with fetal weight higher or equivalent to five hundred grams (500 g). Most cases were registered in the emergency as <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> (73. 4 %) In 26. 6 % of cases, the death occurred within the period of confinement for treatment or investigation. The age of mothers ranged from 14 to 44 years old, being the average 31. 88. Youngers mothers predominated. Diminished fetal movement or lack of movement (22. 2 % and 15. 6 %) and abdominal pain (23. 3 %),were the most frequent complaints. Pathologies associated with hypertension diseases (34 %), and indeterminate causes (32 %), were the most frequent ones. Conclusion: The cases of <b>fetal</b> <b>deaths</b> at the HURNP within the studied period indicate the predominance of pathologies that are associated with hypertension diseases and cases without associated pathology were undetermined. Diagnosis and epidemiological investigation were scarcely applied and deserve further studies. Fundamentos: O óbito fetal não é uma entidade rara. Fatores epidemiológicos, fatores de risco e sua prevalência em diversas populações, ao serem estudados podem incrementar a assistência pré-natal, obstétrica e neonatal. Objetivos: Conhecer a freqüência, analisar e classificar os óbitos fetais que ocorreram no Hospital Universitário do Norte do Paraná no período de 4 (quatro) anos, de 1997 a 2000. Verificar aspectos epidemiológicos e métodos de investigação dos óbitos fetais e comparar dados com a literatura. Métodos: Neste estudo descritivo, todos os casos de óbito fetal do HURNP, no período de 4 anos (de 1997 a 2000), foram revistos retrospectivamente. Os dados foram coletados dos prontuários médicos e submetidos a análise estatística pelo programa EPI INFO. Resultados: Foram identificados 97 casos de óbito fetal no período estudado no HURNP, com idade gestacional de vinte semanas ou mais, e peso fetal maior ou igual a 500 gramas. A maior proporção dos casos deu entrada no Pronto-Socorro em óbito fetal (73, 4 %), e em 26, 6 % dos casos o óbito ocorreu no período de internamento para tratamento ou investigação. Primigestas (36, 6 %) e secundigestas (21, 9 %) predominaram. A idade materna variou de 14 a 44 anos, com média de 31, 88. Faixas etárias mais jovens predominaram. Movimentação fetal diminuída ou ausente (22, 2 % e 15, 6 %) e dor abdominal (23, 3 %), foram as queixas mais freqüentes.
