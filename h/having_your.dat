25|$|In {{the first}} year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after <b>having</b> <b>your</b> {{standard}} racers to decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best of them. Because of this lost of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion.|$|E

Gordon took pole dancing lessons {{for a period of}} a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the {{experience}} embarrassing and physically challenging. She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me – it's like <b>having</b> <b>your</b> mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life.|$|E

[...] Overall, Bayer {{wanted to create a}} darker Nightmare on Elm Street, one he felt would fit into what he describes as [...] "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, [...] "What makes a monster?" [...] Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove? ...|$|E

[...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl could swim.

500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song <b>having</b> <b>your</b> heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
