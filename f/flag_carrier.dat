40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} model of entry {{to analyze the}} effect of previous regulation on European airlines? post-liberalization profits. The author distinguishes between European <b>flag</b> <b>carriers,</b> which are hightly regulated {{at the beginning of}} the eighties, and independent airlines. It is found that the latter enjoy sunk cost advantages but get lower variable profits than the former. This means that possible efficiency disadvantages suffered by the <b>flag</b> <b>carriers</b> are more than offset by their higher perceived quality, leading to a situation in which they are less likely to enter a route, but also less likely to exit.

Amman Civil Airport serves several regional routes and charter flights while Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and is the hub for Royal Jordanian, the <b>flag</b> <b>carrier.</b> Queen Alia International Airport expansion was completed in 2013 with new terminals costing $700 million, to handle over 16 million passengers annually.

50|$|Since the 1944 {{signing of}} the Convention on International Civil Aviation, {{international}} aviation was based on bilateral air transport agreements, in which government would negotiate the rights {{of one or more}} <b>flag</b> <b>carriers</b> to operate routes between the countries. The negotiations focused on retaining each country's <b>flag</b> <b>carrier's</b> market share and also effectively hindered any airline from not being domestically owned—either by the government or by private investors. In 1992, the United States started negotiating open skies agreements with the European Union (EU), which would allow any European airline to fly from any airport in their home country to any airport in the US, and similarly any US airline to fly from any US airport to any European airport.|$|R

40|$|Using a 24 -year {{analysis}} period (1990 - 2013), a {{new perspective}} is offered on long-term first- and second-order developments following liberalisation of the intra-EU air transport market. The focus of the analysis is on supply-side issues, such as airline output, structure of supply, yields, business models, and the position of (former) <b>flag</b> <b>carriers.</b> We find that air transport liberalisation in the EU internal market has facilitated significant growth in both the number and frequency of routes. Greater competition and lower fares at the route level went {{hand in hand with}} ongoing consolidation. The first and second liberalisation packages have enabled former <b>flag</b> <b>carriers</b> to develop into full-service hub-and-spoke carriers. It was only after the third package (1993 - 1997) that low-cost carriers were able to fully develop Europe-wide, point-to-point networks. They rapidly achieved a substantial market share after 2000. Following the adoption of the third package of liberalisation measures, charter operators launched scheduled operations as leisure airlines and adopted in part the new low-cost business model. Until 2013, direct competition between low-cost <b>carriers</b> and former <b>flag</b> <b>carriers</b> was limited due to different route development strategies. This picture has changed in recent years since more low-cost carriers have begun to focus on primary hubs. The competitive impact of the rapidly expanding new generation of hub carriers from Turkey and the Gulf has further increased competitive pressure on the former European <b>flag</b> <b>carriers.</b> Consequently, consolidation of the European airline industry is likely to continue, as well as the ongoing effort to reduce costs. Finally, rising competitive pressure may incentivise EU member states to develop a more protective national aviation policy...|$|R
