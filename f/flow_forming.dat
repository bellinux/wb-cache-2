5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava <b>flow,</b> <b>forming</b> Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
500|$|In April 2017, {{scientists}} {{reported the}} discovery of a [...] "Great Cold Spot" [...] in Jupiter's thermosphere at its north pole that is [...] across, [...] wide, and [...] cooler than surrounding material. The feature was discovered by researchers at the Very Large Telescope in Chile, who then searched archived data from the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between 1995 and 2000. They found that, while the Spot changes size, shape and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its general position in the atmosphere across more than 15 years of available data. Scientists believe the Spot is a giant vortex similar to the Great Red Spot and also appears to be quasi-stable like the vortices in Earth's thermosphere. Interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the planet's strong magnetic field likely resulted in redistribution of heat <b>flow,</b> <b>forming</b> the Spot.|$|E
2500|$|In {{all these}} cases, cooling {{on the upper}} and lower {{surfaces}} of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces. As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the <b>flow,</b> <b>forming</b> the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today. [...] Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Ocate {{volcanic}} field is that the oldest basaltic <b>flows</b> <b>form</b> the highest mesas, and the youngest <b>flows</b> <b>form</b> surfaces lower in elevation. This reverse stratigraphy occurred because after the older flows were erupted about 8.3-5.7 m.y. ago on a relatively flat alluvial plain, the entire area was uplifted, and canyons were cut into the older basalt flows. Younger basalt flows then filled the major stream canyons. When uplift ceased, the youngest basalt flows of the Ocate volcanic field flowed on top of intermediate-aged flows.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>Forming</b> is an {{incremental}} metal forming technique {{in which a}} disk or tube of metal is formed over a mandrel {{by one or more}} rollers using tremendous pressure. The roller deforms the workpiece, forcing it against the mandrel, both axially lengthening and radially thinning it. Since the pressure exerted by the roller is highly localized and the material is incrementally formed, often there is a net savings in energy in forming over drawing or ironing processes. However, these savings are often not realized because of the inherent difficulties in predicting the resulting deformation for a given roller path. <b>Flow</b> <b>forming</b> subjects the workpiece to a great deal of friction and deformation. These two factors may heat the workpiece to several hundred degrees if proper cooling fluid is not utilized.|$|E

Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained quartz called chalcedony. [...] The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited. [...] The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.|$|R

50|$|Wargentin is {{an unusual}} lunar impact crater which has been filled to its rim by a basaltic lava <b>flow,</b> <b>forming</b> a raised plateau. When the lava flow occurred, it erupted from within the crater walls and {{proceeded}} to accumulate until overrunning the lowest portion of the rim. Some blockage then prevented the lava flow from returning to equilibrium. Since the time when this occurred, some ejecta has been deposited across the top, giving the surface a higher albedo than is typical for deposits of basalt.|$|E
