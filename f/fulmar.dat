5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A <b>Fulmar</b> from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one <b>Fulmar</b> failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one <b>Fulmar</b> forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a <b>Fulmar</b> crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one <b>Fulmar</b> and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.|$|E

5|$|Many procellariids have {{breeding}} {{populations of}} over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited {{several species of}} <b>fulmar</b> and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by introduced species attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by long-line fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{the sample}} {{standard}} deviation implies that these 14 <b>fulmars</b> are a sample from a larger population of <b>fulmars.</b> If these 14 <b>fulmars</b> comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving <b>fulmars),</b> then instead {{of the sample}} standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is N instead of N-1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical software packages calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} {{observations of}} foraging northern <b>fulmars</b> (Fulmarus glacialis) in the Barrow Strait-Lancaster Sound {{region of the}} Northwest Territories from June to September 1984 - 90 and in Admiralty Inlet, N. W. T., in July 1989. In each year, <b>fulmars</b> scavenged hunter-killed marine mammal remains {{in the vicinity of}} Resolute Bay. Large feeding flocks, aggregated primarily along tide lines and at upwelling sites, exploited primarily calanoid copepods by surface seizing and diving. Late-season onshore movement of Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) resulted in flocks of several thousand <b>fulmars</b> capturing cod by surface and pursuit diving. We determined experimentally that northern <b>fulmars</b> are capable of diving to 3 m to retrieve cod...|$|R

5|$|Otters, grey seals, {{killer whales}} and harbour {{porpoises}} are frequently seen on and around Papa Stour. Atlantic puffin, Arctic and common tern, bonxie and Arctic skua, northern <b>fulmar,</b> common guillemot, razorbill, curlew, wheatear, ringed plover and {{great black-backed gull}} all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels {{include the}} largest procellariids, the giant petrels, {{as well as}} the two <b>fulmar</b> species, the snow petrel, the Antarctic petrel, and the Cape petrel. The fulmarine petrels are a diverse group with differing habits and appearances, but are linked morphologically by their skull features, {{particularly}} the long prominent nasal tubes.|$|E
5|$|Mingulay {{has a large}} seabird population, and is an {{important}} breeding ground for razorbills (9,514 pairs, 6.3% of the European population), guillemots (11,063 pairs) and black-legged kittiwakes (2,939 pairs). shags (694 individuals), <b>fulmar</b> (11,626 pairs), puffins (2,072 pairs), storm petrel, common terns, Arctic terns, bonxies and various species of gull also nest in the sea-cliffs. Manx shearwaters nested on Lianamul stack until the late 18th century, when they were driven away by puffins, and tysties have also been recorded there.|$|E
5000|$|The convoy {{came under}} low level attack by nine Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 torpedo bombers coordinated with five CANT Z.1007 high level bombers. Four <b>Fulmars</b> met the torpedo planes head-on and shot one down before another SM.79 {{launched}} a torpedo which hit Manchester before also being shot down. Ark Royal launched seven more <b>Fulmars</b> which {{were unable to}} engage the high level bombers before they released bombs which failed to hit the convoyed ships. Three <b>Fulmars</b> were shot down. A later attack by two SM.79s sank [...] killing 35 of her crew. Another bombing attack near-missed [...] causing damage requiring the destroyer to be towed back to Gibraltar. Bristol Beaufighters from Malta assisted Ark Royal <b>Fulmars</b> defending the convoy from these attacks.|$|R

40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{standard procedures}} for the collection and dissection of beachwashed <b>Fulmars</b> used in the Save the North Sea (SNS) '-Fulmar study. Save the North Sea is an international project which aims to reduce marine litter through increased awareness. <b>Fulmars</b> ingest marine litter and accumulate rubbish such as plastics in the stomachs. Therefore, <b>Fulmars</b> are used as {{the symbol of the}} SNS campaign. At the same time, litter in stomach contents of <b>Fulmars</b> is being developed as an international monitoring tool to measure changes in levels of litter. It is one of the Ecological Quality Objectives for the North Sea (EcoQOs') which OSPAR has to implement {{at the request of the}} Ministers of North Sea countries (NSC Bergen Declaration, March 2002).

5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern <b>fulmar</b> vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their water repellent feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern <b>fulmar</b> through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of bird {{life on the}} island has both relied on and helped to advance the spread of plant life. Birds use the plants for nesting material, but also continue {{to assist in the}} spreading of seeds, and fertilize the soil with their guano. Birds first began nesting on Surtsey three years after the eruptions ended, with <b>fulmar</b> and guillemot the first species to set up home. Twelve species are now regularly found on the island.|$|E

5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), <b>fulmar</b> (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, basking shark and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern <b>fulmar</b> pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 March 1941 a Fairey <b>Fulmar</b> from Ark Royal {{stumbled}} across Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at sea. Because of a radio malfunction, the crew {{had to return to}} Ark Royal to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog. The next day, Ark Royal re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult malfunction destroyed a Fairey Swordfish; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, Ark Royal ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft's depth charges detonated. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reached Brest without British harassment, while Ark Royal returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern <b>fulmar</b> in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis supply port of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one <b>Fulmar</b> was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is a {{breeding}} ground for many important seabird species. One of the world's largest colonies of northern gannets, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 percent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of Leach's petrels, up to 90 percent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of Atlantic puffins, about 30 percent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 northern <b>fulmar</b> pairs, about 13 percent of the UK total. Dùn is home to the largest colony of fulmars in Britain. Prior to 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as Fowlsheugh. The last great auk (Pinguinus impennis) seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's bonxies was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.|$|E

They were attacked by {{a large number of}} Aichi D3As and both were sunk. On 9 April 1942 the Royal Navy aircraft carrier [...] escorted by the destroyer [...] were attacked by more than 32 Aichi D3As and both were sunk shortly before eight defending RN FAA Fairey <b>Fulmars,</b> of 806 Squadron, could reach them. The <b>Fulmars</b> shot down four D3As and damaged two while losing two <b>Fulmars</b> to the more numerous D3As.|$|R

40|$|Breeding {{strategies}} of two closely related fulmarine petrels were studied on Ardery Island, on the continental coast of East Antarctica, where short summers {{are expected to}} narrow the time-window for reproduction. Both species had a similar breeding period (97 days from laying to fledging) but Antarctic Petrels Thalassoica antarctica bred up to 16 days earlier than Southern <b>Fulmars.</b> During the pre-laying exodus, all Antarctic Petrels deserted the colony, whereas some Southern <b>Fulmars</b> Fulmarus glacialoides remained. Antarctic Petrels exhibited stronger synchronization in breeding, made longer foraging trips and spent less time guarding their chicks than Southern <b>Fulmars.</b> Overall breeding success of both species was similar but failures of Antarctic Petrels were concentrated in the early egg-phase and after hatching, when parents ceased guarding. Southern <b>Fulmars</b> lost eggs and chicks later in the breeding cycle and so wasted more parental investment in failed breeding attempts. Different breeding strategies may be imposed by flight characteristics; Southern <b>Fulmars</b> are less capable of crossing large expanses of pack ice and need to delay breeding until the sea ice retreats and breaks up. However, due to the short summer they risk chick failure when weather conditions deteriorate late in the season...|$|R
5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans {{and most of the}} seas. They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern <b>fulmar</b> ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Force H was {{recalled}} to the United Kingdom in January and Argus loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron {{for her own}} protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire {{fighters and}} returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to Eagle and embarked nine Fairey <b>Fulmar</b> fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spotter I was for Argus to provide fighter cover for Eagle as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During Operation Picket I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by Eagle on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when Eagle flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from Argus. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Nor {{was this}} the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the Master of Sempill led the semi-official Sempill Mission to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy {{establish}} an air arm. At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in {{limiting the number of}} aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the Blackburn Roc, Fairey <b>Fulmar,</b> Fairey Barracuda, Blackburn Skua and Fairey Swordfish. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts.|$|E
