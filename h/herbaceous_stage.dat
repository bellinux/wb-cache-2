50|$|The park lies {{entirely in}} the dry zone {{although}} the park's southern boundary is near the intermediate zone. The climax community of the area is tropical dry mixed evergreen forests characterized by Drypetes sepiaria, Chloroxylon swietenia, Manilkara hexandra, Pterospermum canescens, wood apple Feronia limonia, Cassia fistula, and Dimorphocalyx glabellus. However {{a majority of the}} forests within the park had been severely exploited for shifting cultivation. This has effected in secondary forests and vast stretches of open plains dominated by grasses. The <b>herbaceous</b> <b>stage</b> is succeeded by shrubs and the thicket stage is characterized by Trema orientalis. Among the first trees to appear is Pterospermum canescens, Drypetes sepiaria, and Manilkara hexandra. Maduru Oya Dam is surrounded by parkland, kept by periodic fires. A number of woody plants occur around the reservoir. A rare and endemic tree Vatica obscura, the only Dipterocarpaceae species to occur in the dry zone, is found in limited locations {{on the banks of the}} Maduru Oya and Gallodai Aru. Exotic teak Tectona grandis is included in the north-eastern region of the park.|$|E
40|$|Grape berries (Vitis vinifera L fruit) {{exhibit a}} double-sigmoid pattern of {{development}} {{that results from}} two successive periods of vacuolar swelling during which the nature of accumulated solutes changes significantly. Throughout the first period, called green or <b>herbaceous</b> <b>stage,</b> berries accumulate high levels of organic acids, mainly malate and tartrate. At the cellular level fruit acidity comprises both metabolism and vacuolar storage. Malic acid compartmentation is critical for optimal functioning of cytosolic enzymes. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the carriers involved in malate transport across sub-cellular compartments is of great importance. The decrease in acid content during grape berry ripening has been mainly associated to mitochondrial malate oxidation. However, no Vitis vinifera mitochondrial carrier involved in malate transport {{has been reported to}} date. Here we describe the identification of three V. vinifera mitochondrial dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate carriers (VvDTC 1 - 3) putatively involved in mitochondrial malate, citrate and other di/tricarboxylates transport. The three VvDTCs are very similar, sharing a percentage of identical residues of at least 83 %. Expression analysis of the encoding VvDTC genes in grape berries shows that they are differentially regulated exhibiting a developmental pattern of expression. The simultaneous high expression of both VvDTC 2 and VvDTC 3 in grape berry mesocarp close to the onset of ripening suggests that these carriers might be involved in the transport of malate into mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{development}} of grapevine and berry composition are both {{strongly influenced by}} temperature. To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine berries response to high temperatures are poorly understood. Unlike recent data that addressed the effects on berry {{development of}} elevated temperatures applied at the whole plant level, the present work particularly focuses on the fruit responses triggered by direct exposure to heat treatment (HT). In the context of climate change, this work focusing on temperature effect at the microclimate level {{is of particular interest}} as it can help to better understand the consequences of leaf removal (a common viticultural practice) on berry development. HT (+ 8 °C) was locally applied to clusters from Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at three different developmental stages (middle green, veraison and middle ripening). Samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment and used for metabolic and transcriptomic analyses. The results showed dramatic and specific biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat exposed berries, depending on the developmental stage and the stress duration. When applied at the <b>herbaceous</b> <b>stage,</b> HT delayed the onset of veraison. Heating also strongly altered the berry concentration of amino acids and organic acids (e. g., phenylalanine, γ-aminobutyric acid and malate) and decreased the anthocyanin content at maturity. These physiological alterations could be partly explained by the deep remodeling of transcriptome in heated berries. More than 7000 genes were deregulated in {{at least one of the}} nine experimental conditions. The most affected processes belong to the categories "stress responses," "protein metabolism" and "secondary metabolism," highlighting the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive HT and to build adaptive responses. Additionally, important changes in processes related to "transport," "hormone" and "cell wall" might contribute to the postponing of veraison. Finally, opposite effects depending on heating duration were observed for genes encoding enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, suggesting that the HT-induced decrease in anthocyanin content may result from a combination of transcript abundance and product degradation...|$|E
40|$|Changes of floristic {{composition}} {{were observed}} for 7 years in an experimental field of secondary succession. In the 1 -year-old stand, Echinochloa crus-galli var. crus-galli was the dominant species, and Chenopodium album and Digilaria violascens were important constituent. The sequence of dominant species during the succession was Erigeron spp. (Erigeron annuus, and E. canadensis) in 2 -year-old stands, and Artemisia princeps in 3 -year-old stands. A. princeps maintained its dominance from 4 -year-old to 7 -year-old stands. Miscanthus sinensis {{was established in}} the 3 -year-old stands and increased in later stages. Rumex acetosella and Oenothera parviflora were important constituent species during succession, Four stages of secondary succession were recognized in <b>herbaceous</b> <b>stages</b> by different life-forms : summer annual, biennial (winter annual), perannial herb and perennial grass. Comparing secondary succession in various sites in temoerate regions, the dominant species of each stage was similar in their life form. Raunkiaer 2 ̆ 7 s life-form spectra change from the therophyte type in the 1 -and 2 -year-old stands to hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes in later stages of succession. The dominant disseminule form in the 1 -year-old stand was clitochore, and anemochore increased in the later three stages. The type of life history of the dominants was the same in the same seral stage among the sites in temperate regions. Key words; Secondary succession, Experiment, Mechanis...|$|R
40|$|Successional {{changes in}} carbon {{sequestration}} across a forested chronosequence were studied. Forest floor carbon increases rapidly during succession and later decreasing in mature areas. The {{composition of the}} forest floor carbon differed significantly among successional <b>stages.</b> <b>Herbaceous</b> material declined from 74 % to less than 1 % where as woody foliage increased.

40|$|Seventy six {{medicinal}} plants were investigated for vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) association {{in a survey}} of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza was found to be of universal occurrence in all plants located at different habitats. Great variations were found in the VAM infection percentage and the extent of hyphal infection. Plants at vegetative stage exhibited more VAM infection percentage compared to those at flowering and fruiting <b>stages.</b> <b>Herbaceous</b> plants showed more infections in comparison with the shrubby and woody plants. The extent of root colonization by VA endohphytes varied with the soil type and plant species. Endophytes other than VA were also recorded...|$|R
40|$|Soil pore {{is a key}} {{attribute}} of the soil structure that affects soil reservoir under natural vegetation recovery on the Loess Plateau. This study is to quantitatively analyze soil pore parameters, measured with Computed Tomography (CT) at 15 - 57 mm depths under five different vegetation succession stages using a concept of substituting "space" for "time" in the Ziwuling Forest Region of the Loess Plateau. The {{results showed that the}} soil pore parameters, such as pore number, porosity, circularity, and fractal dimension, increased significantly under the natural vegetation successions and varied with the pattern climax community stage > pioneering arbor community stage > scrub community <b>stage</b> > <b>herbaceous</b> community <b>stage</b> > abandoned farmland stage, indicating that natural vegetation recovery could remarkably improve soil pore characteristics. With the vegetation succession, this positive effect will be strengthened gradually, which means that the soil pore parameters may appear to be best at the climax community stage. Soil organic matter content increased linearly with the soil pore parameters (P < 0. 001). Increased organic matter accumulation was one of the major reasons for the changes in soil pore characteristics in natural vegetation successio...|$|R
