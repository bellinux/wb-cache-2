40|$|Abstract. 3 D {{terrestrial}} {{laser scanner}} (TLS) provides both 3 D point coordinates and intensity data of scanned object surface. The intensity {{data can be}} used to discriminate different materials, since it partly represents the object reflection characteristic at the laser wavelength. In addition to laser reflectance properties of object, the intensity data is influenced by many other factors, such as instrument mechanism, environmental condition, distance and incidence angle. In this paper, the effects of distance and incidence angle are studied. Except for standard reflector, some building facades of various kind of material were used as <b>experimental</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>Experimental</b> <b>survey</b> find that the intensity is inversely proportional to distance and incidence angle, but their relations do not agree with the theoretical model. Several models were selected to describe the relations between intensity and distance, intensity and incidence angle. The suitability of each model was analyzed by its correlation coefficient...|$|R

The maximum likelihood approach is available only when the full probability structure of the survey data is known. However, this knowledge is rarely available in practice. Based on central limit theory, statisticians are often willing to accept the assumption that data have, say, a normal probability structure. However, such an assumption may not be reasonable in many situations in which <b>sample</b> <b>surveys</b> are used.

40|$|Disruption of transit {{service is}} a common {{occurrence}} in many cities around the world, and these incidents may have serious impacts on the transit user’s journey. Transit user behavioural response under disrupted service conditions, specifically how transit riders choose among available mode options to complete their trips, is not well understood. Mode choice studies often lack proper consideration of travel time variability and uncertainty in such situations, neither do they fully account for some options considered by users, such as waiting, taking a shuttle bus, or cancelling the trip. This study aims to investigate transit user mode choice in response to peak hour rapid transit service disruption in the City of Toronto, incorporating such factors as the type of disruption, stage of the passenger’s trip (pre-trip or en-route), weather conditions, and uncertainty of delay duration. A joint Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) survey is designed where the RP part gathers information on the respondent’s actual response {{to the most recent}} service disruption while the SP part solicits the respondent’s responses under a set of hypothetical service disruption scenarios. A transit trip planner tool is developed to generate alternative transit mode and path options to avoid the disrupted segment. The survey methodology is discussed including the scope, <b>experimental</b> design, <b>survey</b> <b>sample</b> design, <b>survey</b> instrument design, and survey implementation. The data collected would be used to develop econometric models to understand the potential effects of different factors on the choice making behaviour of transit users under conditions of service interruption...|$|R

In 1961, the Directorate of NSS started functioning under the Department of Statistics of Government of India, and later in 1971, the design and analysis wing of NSS was shifted from ISI to the Department of Statistics forming the National <b>Sample</b> <b>Survey</b> Organisation (NSSO).|$|R
