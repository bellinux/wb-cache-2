5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prominent}} American {{to reveal}} his homosexuality was the poet Robert Duncan. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine Politics, he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority. The decidedly clandestine Mattachine Society, founded by Harry Hay and other veterans of the Wallace for President campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> the smell of {{decomposition}} still lingered in the apartment. Knorr became concerned that the smell and physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings {{out of the home}} and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of lighter fluid on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to keep a low profile. In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Shortly after Robert, Jr.'s arrest, Knorr left Las Vegas and relocated to Salt Lake City.|$|E

I fear that an increasing number of such peop!e are beginning to emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closets.</b> Tell-tale signs abound; graduate assistants with word processors; assistant professors who can barely supress a craving for answering services and secretaries; full professors who are afraid to accept invitations to cocktail parties in case there might be someone there who has never heard of them.

25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E
500|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. [...] It used a wooden tub, or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. [...] The pails were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of the pail carried a cast iron rim about 3inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. [...] The pails were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during the day. [...] Each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. [...] While the pail was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> a replacement was installed in its place. [...] In 1874, Rochdale Corporation employed five such wagons in full-time service, collecting from 3,354privies spread across the town. [...] By contrast, with a much larger population, Manchester Corporation employed 73wagons. [...] By 1875, 4,741pails were in use, and in 1876 the number was5,566. [...] A separate cart accompanied the wagon to collect other household refuse which was collected from a separate chamber in the pail closet.|$|E

The Count enters and hears a noise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> He tries to open it, but it is locked. The Countess tells him it is only Susanna, trying on her wedding dress.

The Count shouts for her to identify herself by her voice, but the Countess orders her to be silent. Furious and suspicious, the Count leaves, with the Countess, in search of tools to force the closet door open. As they leave, he locks all the bedroom doors to prevent the intruder from escaping. Cherubino and Susanna emerge from their hiding places, and Cherubino escapes by jumping through the window into the garden. Susanna then takes Cherubino's former place in the closet, vowing to make the Count look foolish (duet: Aprite, presto, aprite – [...] "Open the door, quickly!").|$|E
