2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best stuff at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fossum and Garan {{completed}} the second STS-124 spacewalk. The 7-hour, 11-minute excursion ended at 22:15 UTC.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{the country}} would be a {{banishment}} while you are here," [...] said Deronda, rising and walking round the double room, which yet offered no long promenade, while he made a great fan of his handkerchief. [...] "This is the happiest room in the world to me. Besides, I will imagine myself in the East, since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to go there some day. Only I will not wear a cravat and a heavy ring there," [...] he ended emphatically, pausing to take off those superfluities and deposit them on a small table behind Ezra, who had {{the table in front of}} him covered with books and papers.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter, Frank. There {{is the place}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for her. And if I were there, {{you and your wife}} would always be {{thinking}} about it. And every fellow about the estate knows the whole story. It {{seems to me to be}} almost inconceivable that a woman should have done such a thing." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} {{bell rang}} just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> {{to call at}} Marlow Square and inform Mrs Drassilis {{of the position of}} affairs. Cynthia, I imagined, would have broken the news already, which would mitigate the embarrassment of the interview to some extent; but the recollection of my last night's encounter with Mrs Drassilis prevented me from looking forward with any joy to the prospect of meeting her again.|$|E
60|$|Slavery {{was dead}} and gone; all men were equal before the law; {{taxation}} had been equalized. The telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, and all the thousand willing and handy servants of steam and electricity were working their way into favor. We had a steamboat or two on the Thames, we had steam warships, and {{the beginnings of a}} steam commercial marine; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to send out an expedition to discover America.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts {{said in a}} 2007 interview: [...] "Right now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{focusing}} on movies. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> {{to start a new}} movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue." [...] In another interview, she said: [...] "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is indeed}} an {{unexpected}} pleasure," [...] she murmured. [...] "Do sit down somewhere.

60|$|Just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to go {{to sleep}} I heard a jingle of harness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed {{together}} when the time comes to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well; I slept very badly. To begin with, Maurice Anscombe, {{generally}} the most cheerful and nonchalant of mortals with a jest for every woe, {{was in a}} most depressed condition, and informed me of it several times, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to turn in. He {{said he thought the}} place hateful and felt as if people he could not see were looking at him (I had the same sensation but did not mention the fact to him). When I told him he was talking stuff, he only replied that he could not help it, and pointed out that it was not his general habit to be downcast in any danger, which was quite true. Now, he added, he was enjoying much the same sensations as he did when first he saw the Yellow-wood Swamp and got the idea into his head that he would kill some one there, which happened in due course.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'd been a widder-man {{for three}} yers, {{and his sister}} kept house for him. Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house. It was worth looking after, too, mind you that. It's a {{handsome}} house. Jog along, black mare. As for Thomas, he was poor, and if his house didn't leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it, though it looks kind of pictureaskew. But, y'see, I loved Thomas, and I didn't care one red cent for W.O. So I argued it out with myself. 'Sarah Crowe,' say I--my first was a Crowe--'you can marry your rich man if you like but you won't be happy. Folks can't get along together in this world without {{a little bit of}} love. You'd just better tie up to Thomas, for he loves you and you love him and nothing else ain't going to do you.' Jog along, black mare. So I told Thomas I'd take him. All the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> I never dared drive past W.O.'s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again. But now I never think of it at all, and I'm just that comfortable and happy with Thomas. Jog along, black mare." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{meantime}} {{they had the}} help of a prominent neighbour, Laurent Jalabert. The two had not been friends and did not see each other much in Switzerland. Then, Jalabert opened links by getting his wife, Sylvie, to ask St√©phanie Virenque for the loan of a vacuum cleaner that she didn't actually need. Jalabert said that later, [...] "Richard called me one day when my wife and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to move house. He was desperate to help us even though we didn't really need any help. It <b>was</b> then that <b>I</b> realised his distress. He spent the whole day taking the furniture apart and putting it back together again. It's odd, but that day did him an awful lot of good." [...] Jalabert and his wife Sylvie said that, as a souvenir, they had kept the doors of one of their closets upside down because that was the way Virenque had fitted them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She is all right. Been {{married three}} times; buried two husbands, {{divorced}} from the third, and <b>I</b> hear she <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to marry an old fellow out in Colorado somewhere. She's got children scattered around here and there, most everywheres.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it, for <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> out all day. Here, draw up to the blaze. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>getting</b> supper <b>ready.</b> You've got some game, I see. I had very little luck--three rabbits and a wild turkey. I looked for deer, {{but it was no}} use." ...|$|R
6000|$|He didn't say anything, but I {{noticed he}} turned up his collar and pulled down his hat over his eyes and ears. The gilly said that perhaps I had too much line out, and so he took the rod and wound up {{a good deal of}} the line. I liked this better, because it was easier to whip out the line and pull it in again. Of course, I would not be likely to catch fish so much nearer the boat, but then we can't have {{everything}} in this world. Once I thought I had a bite, and I gave the rod such a jerk that the line flew back against me, and when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to throw it out again, I found that one of the little hooks had stuck fast in my thumb. I tried to take it out with the other hand, but it was awfully awkward to do, because the rod wobbled and kept jerking on it. The gilly asked me if there was anything the matter with the flies, but I didn't want him to know what had happened, and so I said, [...] "Oh, no," [...] and turning my back on him I tried my best to get the hook out without his helping me, for I didn't want him to think that the first thing I caught was myself, after just missing my husband--he might be afraid it would be his turn next. You cannot imagine how bothersome it is to go fishing with a gilly to wait on you. I would rather wash dishes with a sexton to wipe them and look for nicks on the edges.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{knew when}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> {{to do the}} movie that I was taking a chance," [...] said Hill.

60|$|It {{was a year}} or two ago now. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting {{one evening}} at the gate, smoking a pipe and looking at a {{newspaper}} I 'ad found in the office, when I see a gentleman coming along from the swing-bridge. Well- dressed, clean-shaved chap 'e was, smoking a cigarette. He was walking slow and looking about 'im casual-like, until his eyes fell on me, when he gave a perfect jump of surprise, and, arter looking at me very 'ard, walked on a little way and then turned back. He did it twice, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just going to say something to 'im, something that <b>I</b> 'ad <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for 'im, when he spoke to me.|$|R
5000|$|Madof {{has said}} [...] "The initial idea for Zion80 {{came to me}} rather spontaneously in 2011 after I had been {{listening}} for several hours to Fela Kuti‚Äôs music. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to take my kids to shul (synagogue) on Shabbat morning and started humming a song by Shlomo Carlebach.

5000|$|During the {{aforementioned}} interview, Ice Prince {{shed some light}} on his record deal with Chocolate City, saying: [...] "My record deal with Chocolate City came off of my affiliation with MI and Jesse Jagz. We are pretty much brothers, we‚Äôve always lived together, always been together. But then Chocolate City signed MI first. It was like they did it in order of our age. Then they signed Jesse Jagz. Jesse was obviously more ready than I was at that time. Then they saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> as well and they signed me too." ...|$|E
5000|$|Forbes was outspoken, {{particularly}} {{on matters of}} race and the poor.

[...] "I ducked, and the leg hit me on the shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to go at this point, but his bodyguard stepped in.

6000|$|... "I {{could not}} know that, Mary. That high and mighty letter of yours told me nothing except what I knew already--that I have a sister. In the {{postscript}} you said you wished to consult me about something, and had things to tell me.

5000|$|Released on 20 March 2009, it is {{the third}} single from the album The Circus. Its B-Side is 84, the same B-Side of their {{preceding}} single Up All Night, and is sung by Jason Orange. Mark Owen confessed to Observer Music Monthly that his wish to sing this song's bridge didn't come to fruition. Said Owen: [...] "I was hoping it'd be my role, you know: sings [...] "Everyone!

I would like to thank Mark Banaszak Holl for giving me the second chance at graduate school and for nominating me for the Peter A. S. Smith Fellowship. The award and Mark‚Äôs considerate managing style has made me think in the positive light, something I needed very much at the time. Most of all, I thank Mark for the standards of excellence that he insisted upon and (painfully) instilled in me as we worked on the C-H activation chemistry. This {{is very important to me}} as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to take on the new challenges in the chemical field. I would like to thank the faculty and staff of the University of Michigan for their excellent teaching and support. Classes of Dr. Melanie Sanford, Dr. Edwin Vedejs and Dr. John P.

I thank Dr. Sanford, Dr. Wolfe and Dr. Nriagu for their role as my graduate committee members. I thank Roy Wentz and Ed Burton for being able to carry out research as rapidly as possible.
