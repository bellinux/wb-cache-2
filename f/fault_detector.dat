Incipient fault detection methods applied in large induction motors of greater than 100 hp are often too costly or physically impractical for use on small- and medium-size induction mo-tors. This paper develops a neural network-based incipient <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> for small- and medium-size induction motors. The neural network-based incipient <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> avoids the prob-lems associated with traditional incipient fault detection schemes by employing more readily available information such as rotor speed and stator current.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a domain {{specific}} process to assist the verification of observer-based fault detection software. Observer-based fault detection systems, like control systems, yield invariant properties of quadratic types. These quadratic invariants express both safety properties of the software such as the boundedness of the states and correctness properties such as the absence of false alarms from the <b>fault</b> <b>detector.</b> We seek to leverage these quadratic invariants, in an automated fashion, for the formal verification of the fault detection software. The approach, {{referred to as the}} credible autocoding framework [1], can be characterized as autocoding with proofs. The process starts with the <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> model, along with its safety and correctness properties, all expressed formally in a synchronous modeling environment such as Simulink. The model is then transformed by a prototype credible autocoder into both code and analyzable annotations for the code.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, online {{shopping}} has already penetrated into the everyday {{life as the}} E-commerce business is growing by leaps and bounds. However, unexpected faults and unplanned downtime of web servers, related to both hardware and software problems continue to cause E-commerce companies to lose revenue. User-visible faults is the major reason E-commerce sites lose revenue and moreover, lose customer loyalty. Detecting user-visible faults sometimes is a difficult task as some of these faults do not produce any error message in the server log files. Therefore, a <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> which can detect user-visible faults autonomously is needed to support E-commerce site. End-users appear to change their behavior toward an E-commerce site when they encounter a user-visible fault. This change {{is reflected in the}} request transition probability matrix, based on similar mathematical definitions found in state transitions of random processes, such as the Markov processes (chains). This work proposes a system which detects abnormal changes in end-user behavior as reflected in the request transition matrix of web servers. The proposed <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> is capable of detecting not only changes reflected in the request transition probability matrix but also analyzing the request transition probability matrix to determine whether a real fault or just a special event is taking place. This reduces the false alarm rate. The detector can also localize faults by determining which request and which web page exhibits the fault. The detection time for injected faults and the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves at a given maximum detection time are used to analyze the performance of the proposed <b>fault</b> <b>detector.</b> The detection results are compared with those obtained by {{one of the most promising}} user-visible fault detectors published in the literature. For detection time of more than about 30 minutes, the results demonstrate that the proposed <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> dramatically reduces the false alarm rate. Furthermore, it distinguishes between real faults and special events. It also provide stable detection times for injected faults irrespective of end-user workload and improves the detection times for two of the four injected faults. At the detection time less than about 30 minutes, the proposed detector?s fault detection rate suffers but still with acceptable false alarm rate. At these low detection rates, the comparable detector from the literature provides marginally better fault detection at significantly higher false positive rates. Furthermore, both detectors have unacceptably low detection rates. A realtime, online version of the fault detection system is also developed in this research. This fault detection system is easy to deploy because it does not require any modifications to the web server source code. Also, it does not produce significant overhead for the monitored web server. Overall, the proposed <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> has all of the following desirable characteristics: early fault detection, false alarm rate reduction, easy deployment, and effective fault localization...|$|E

Therefore, many fault-tolerant techniques have been proposedto increase system reliability, such as active redundancy, which can beimplemented in both space and time dimensions.

40|$|Network {{diagnosis}} in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is {{a difficult}} task due to their improvisational nature, invisibility of internal running status, and particularly since the network structure can frequently change due to link failure. To solve this problem, we propose a Mobile Sink (MS) based distributed fault diagnosis algorithm for WSNs. An MS, or mobile <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> is usually a mobile robot or vehicle equipped with a wireless transceiver that performs the task of a mobile base station while also diagnosing the hardware and software status of deployed network sensors. Our MS mobile <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> moves through the network area polling each static sensor node to diagnose the hardware and software status of nearby sensor nodes using only single hop communication. Therefore, the fault detection accuracy and functionality of the network is significantly increased. In order to maintain an excellent Quality of Service (QoS), we employ an optimal fault diagnosis tour planning algorithm. In addition to saving energy and time, the tour planning algorithm excludes faulty sensor nodes from the next diagnosis tour. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms through simulation and real life experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Existing {{approaches}} to diagnosing sensor networks are generally sink-based, which rely on actively pulling state information from all sensor nodes {{so as to}} conduct centralized analysis. However, the sink-based diagnosis tools incur huge communication overhead to the traffic sensitive sensor networks. Also, due to the unreliable wireless communications, sink often obtains incomplete and sometimes suspicious information, leading to highly inaccurate judgments. Even worse, we observe that it is always more difficult to obtain state information from the problematic or critical regions. To address the above issues, we present the concept of self-diagnosis, which encourages each single sensor to join the fault decision process. We design a series of novel fault detectors through which multiple nodes can cooperate {{with each other in}} a diagnosis task. The fault detectors encode the diagnosis process to state transitions. Each sensor can participate in the fault diagnosis by transiting the detector’s current state to a new one based on local evidences and then pass the <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> to other nodes. Having sufficient evidences, the <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> achieves the Accept state and outputs the final diagnosis report.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we study}} a new {{approach}} to fault detection for autonomous robots. Our hypothesis is that hardware faults change the flow of sensory data and the actions performed by the control program. By detecting these changes, the presence of faults can be inferred. In order to test our hypothesis, we collect data from three different tasks performed by real robots. During a number of training runs, we record sensory data from the robots while they are operating normally and after a fault has been injected. We use back-propagation neural networks to synthesize fault detection components based on the data collected in the training runs. We evaluate the performance of the trained fault detectors in terms of number of false positives and time it takes to detect a fault. The results show that good fault detectors can be obtained. We extend the set of possible faults and go on to show that a single <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> can be trained to detect several faults in both a robot’s sensors and actuators. We show that fault detectors can be synthesized that are robust to variations in the task, and we show how a <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> can be trained to allow one robot to detect faults that occur in another robot...|$|E

40|$|In grid computing, load {{balancing}} with optimal resource utilization and fault tolerance are important issues. The {{availability of the}} selected resources for job execution is a primary factor that determines the computing performance. Typically, {{the probability of a}} failure is higher in the grid computing than in a traditional parallel computing and the failure of resources affects job execution fatally. Therefore, a fault tolerance service is essential in grid. Also grid services are often expected to meet some minimum levels of Quality of Service (QoS) for a desirable operation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{distributed}} fault detection for discrete-time Markov jump linear systems over sensor networks with Markovian switching topologies. The sensors are scatteredly deployed in the sensor field and the fault detectors are physically distributed via acommunication network. The system dynamics changes and sensing topology variations are modeled by a discrete-time Markov chain with incomplete mode transition probabilities. Each of these sensor nodes firstly collects measurement outputs from its all underlying neighboring nodes, processes these data {{in accordance with the}} Markovian switching topologies, and then transmits the processed data to the remote <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> node. Network-induced delays and accumulated data packet dropouts are incorporated in the data transmission between the sensor nodes and the distributed <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> nodes through the communication network. To generate localized residual signals, mode-independent distributed fault detection filters are proposed. By means of the stochastic Lyapunov functional approach, the residual system performance analysis is carried out such that the overall residual system is stochastically stable and the error between each residual signal and the fault signal is made as small as possible. Furthermore, a sufficient condition on the existence of the mode-independent distributed fault detection filtersis derived in the simultaneous presence of incomplete mode transition probabilities, Markovian switching topologies, network-induced delays, and accumulated data packed dropouts.
