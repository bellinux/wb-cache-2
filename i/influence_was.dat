5|$|Renaissance trends from Italy and Central Europe {{influenced}} Russia in many ways. Their <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> rather limited, however, due to {{the large}} distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their Orthodox traditions and Byzantine legacy.|$|E

5|$|After 1700 British {{continental}} {{policy was}} to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power {{during the previous}} two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession and the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} OSI album, Office of Strategic <b>Influence,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 2003, Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore {{returned to their}} respective projects. Matheos released the album FWX and toured with Fates Warning. Moore moved from Costa Rica to Istanbul, Turkey.

5|$|Against {{all these}} reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who {{included}} most of Dunstan's own relatives, {{and who had}} an interest in maintaining established customs. For nine years Dunstan's <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and Crediton in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} stylistic <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> {{the experimental}} oeuvre of Kenneth Anger, {{and in particular}} Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. Noé saw Anger's films in the early 1990s, while promoting the short film Carne, and quickly became a fan. Other influences from experimental cinema included the works of Jordan Belson and Peter Tscherkassky. Noé's favourite film, , was the most prominent influence among mainstream films; Noé {{wanted to become a}} filmmaker after he saw it at the age of seven. Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes and other films which feature hovering overhead shots inspired Noé to make a film largely from such a perspective.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's {{older brother}} by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s. The situation improved in 1963 when Jesper Høm arranged an {{exhibition at the}} Danish Museum of Art & Design with photographers from New York City, Moscow and Paris. Another positive <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City with photographs of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken {{while he was a}} student at Chicago's Institute of Design, some of which were published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E

25|$|Social <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> an {{overarching}} term given {{to describe the}} persuasive effects people have on each other. It {{is seen as a}} fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: conformity, compliance, and obedience. Social <b>influence</b> <b>is</b> also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of <b>influence</b> <b>are</b> strongest when they take place in social groups.|$|R

5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his artistic}} talents, Kim's main {{interest}} was medicine, and {{he applied for}} entrance into medical school upon graduation {{from high school in}} 1940. When he failed to gain admittance, Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and save up money to reapply for medical school. The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim often went to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> to show in his mature film style.|$|E

40|$|Peer <b>influences</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} most {{powerful}} correlates of adolescent problem behavior. Using a sibling sample and hierarchical linear modeling to control for shared influences on behavior, the role was examined of nonshared parent and peer influences as prospective predictors of adolescent cigarette smoking onset. These results were compared to results from a subsample of nonsiblings. Peer <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> significant predictors of smoking onset when shared <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> controlled, suggesting that peer group characteristics operate, at least partially, as nonshared influences. Furthermore, nonshared peer <b>influences</b> <b>were</b> stronger in more educated families than in less educated families. Results highlight the potential utility of controlling for shared influences, and support the importance of {{taking into account the}} broader social context...|$|R
5|$|Frusciante's {{first major}} <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> Jimi Hendrix. He then saw The Red Hot Chili Peppers (at that point, The {{was part of}} their name) in concert in 1985, after which their then-guitarist Hillel Slovak became his second major influence, with Frusciante coming to idolize Slovak. Although Hendrix and Slovak were arguably Frusciante's most {{profound}} influences, he was also inspired by glam rock artists David Bowie, and T. Rex; as well as avant-garde acts such as Syd Barrett, Captain Beefheart, The Residents, The Velvet Underground, Neu!, Van der Graaf Generator, Frank Zappa, and Kraftwerk.|$|E
5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting the children from an experience he had with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

5|$|In Edgbaston, Tolkien {{lived there}} {{in the shadow of}} Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which may have {{influenced}} the images of the dark towers within his works.

5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting physical exercise, Isamu Kurosawa {{was open to}} Western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit. He encouraged his children to watch films; young Akira viewed his first movies {{at the age of}} six. An important formative <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> his elementary school teacher Mr Tachikawa, whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general. During this time, the boy also studied calligraphy and Kendo swordsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} {{evolution}} of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines has {{a wide array of}} ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This is due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an archipelago thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish <b>influence</b> <b>was</b> minimal in the region of Zamboanga.|$|E
