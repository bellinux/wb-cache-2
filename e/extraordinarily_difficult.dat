5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the defendants. It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the defendants, consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the defendants separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>difficult,</b> lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the defendants. Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the defendants. The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the defendants had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the defendants Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the remains}} of over seventy {{individuals}} have been found, {{most of them are}} partial and fragmentary. The skeleton of Leedsichthys is thus only imperfectly known. This is largely caused by the fact that many skeletal elements, including the front of the skull and the vertebral centra, did not ossify but remained cartilage. Furthermore, those that did ossify were gradually hollowed out during the lifetime of the animal by resorption of the inner bone tissue. In the fossil phase, compression flattened and cracked these hollow structures, making it <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>difficult</b> to identify them or determine their original form.|$|E
25|$|It was due {{entirely to}} him that Sigismund as king-elect was forced to confirm the resolutions at the Uppsala Synod in 1593, thereby {{recognizing}} the fact that Sweden was essentially a Lutheran Protestant state.

In the ensuing years 1593—1595, Charles's task was <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>difficult.</b> He had steadily to oppose Sigismund's reactionary tendencies and directives; he had also to curb the nobility which sought to increase their power {{at the expense of}} the absent king, which he did with cruel rigor.|$|E
50|$|Spatiotemporal gene {{expression}} is the activation of genes within specific tissues of an organism at specific times during development. Gene activation patterns vary widely in complexity.

Some, on the other hand, are <b>extraordinarily</b> intricate and <b>difficult</b> to predict and model, with expression fluctuating wildly from minute to minute or from cell to cell. Spatiotemporal variation {{plays a key role}} in generating the diversity of cell types found in developed organisms; since the identity of a cell is specified by the collection of genes actively expressed within that cell, if {{gene expression}} was uniform spatially and temporally, there could be at most one kind of cell.|$|R

One proposed solution for accelerating production has been the creation of repositories of reusable software components or learning objects.

Although many agree on the value of this approach, few repositories of such components have been successfully created. This paper suggests some reasons for the lack of expected results and proposes two strategies for developing such repositories. A case study is reported that provides a proof of concept of these strategies. (Contains 20 references.)

40|$|Six-degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) {{trajectory}} optimization of a {{reentry vehicle}} is solved using a two-timescale collocation methodology. This class of 6 DOF trajectory problems {{are characterized by}} two distinct timescales in their governing equations, where {{a subset of the}} states have high-frequency dynamics (the rotational equations of motion) while the remaining states (the translational equations of motion) vary comparatively slowly. With conventional collocation methods, the 6 DOF problem size becomes <b>extraordinarily</b> large and <b>difficult</b> to solve. Utilizing the two-timescale collocation architecture, the problem size is reduced significantly. The converged solution shows a realistic landing profile and captures the appropriate high-frequency rotational dynamics. A large reduction in the overall problem size (by 55 %) is attained with the two-timescale architecture as compared to the conventional single-timescale collocation method. Consequently, optimum 6 DOF trajectory problems can now be solved efficiently using collocation, which was not previously possible for a system with two distinct timescales in the governing states...|$|R

However, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks led the league to postpone its September 16 games and play them {{a week after the}} scheduled conclusion of the regular season. This caused the playoffs and Super Bowl to be delayed by one week.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{continued}} {{presence of}} stigma and its persistence even {{in areas where}} HIV prevalence is high makes it an <b>extraordinarily</b> important, yet <b>difficult,</b> issue to eradicate. The study aimed to assess current and emerging HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination trends in South Africa as experienced by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). Methods The PLHIV Stigma Index, a questionnaire that measures and detects changing trends in relation to stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV, {{was used as the}} survey tool. The study was conducted in 10 clinics in four provinces supported by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD), with an interview total of 486 PLHIV. A cross-sectional design was implemented in the study, and both descriptive and inferential analysis was conducted on the data. Results Findings suggest that PLHIV in this population experience significant levels of stigma and discrimination that negatively impact on their health, working and family life, as well as their access to health services. Internalised stigma was prominent, with many participants blaming themselves for their status. Conclusion The findings can be used to develop and inform programmes and interventions to reduce stigma experienced by PLHIV. The current measures for dealing with stigma should be expanded to incorporate the issues related to health, education and discrimination experienced in the workplace, that were highlighted by the study...|$|R
40|$|Losses due {{to natural}} hazard events can be <b>extraordinarily</b> high and <b>difficult</b> to cope with. Therefore, there is {{considerable}} interest to estimate {{the potential impact of}} current and future extreme events at all scales in as much detail as possible. As hazards typically spread over wider areas, risk assessment must take into account interrelations between regions. Neglecting such interdependencies can lead to a severe underestimation of potential losses, especially for extreme events. This underestimation of extreme risk can lead to the failure of risk management strategies when they are most needed, namely, in times of unprecedented events. In this article, we suggest a methodology to incorporate such interdependencies in risk via the use of copulas. We demonstrate that by coupling losses, dependencies can be incorporated in risk analysis, avoiding the underestimation of risk. Based on maximum discharge data of river basins and stream networks, we present and discuss different ways to couple loss distributions of basins while explicitly incorporating tail dependencies. We distinguish between coupling methods that require river structure data for the analysis and those that do not. For the later approach we propose a 'minimax' algorithm to choose coupled basin pairs so that the underestimation of risk is avoided and the use of river structure data is not needed. The proposed methodology is especially useful for large-scale analysis and we motivate and apply our method using the case of Romania. The approach can be easily extended to other countries and natural hazards...|$|R

How {{the economic}} conditions of homes may be controlled to accomplish New Republican ends {{has already been}} discussed {{with a view to}} a hygienic minimum, and obviously the same, or similar, methods may be employed to secure less materialistic benefits.

Man is indeed so spiritual a being that he will turn every materialistic development you force upon him into spiritual growth. You can aerate his house, not only with air, but with ideas.

The days of mystic individualism have passed, few people nowadays will agree to that strange creed that we must deal with economic conditions as though they were inflexible laws. Economic conditions are made and compact of the human will, and by tariffs, by trade regulation and organization, fresh strands of will may be woven into the complex.

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Allied {{campaign}} was {{hampered by the}} poor intelligence available, which included antiquated maps, unfamiliarity with the terrain, and limited aerial photography. Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>difficult</b> terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground. In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua—widely criticised at the time—led to an eventual, though costly, victory. The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that [...] "the only result, strategically speaking" [...] of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua [...] "was that {{after six months of}} bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the Southwest Pacific Area was exactly where {{it would have been the}} previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there". More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The name Hells Gate {{was derived}} from the journal of {{explorer}} Simon Fraser, who in 1808 described this narrow passage as [...] "a place where no human should venture, for surely these are the gates of Hell." [...] Long before the arrival of Simon Fraser, and as early {{as the end of the}} last ice age, Hells Gate was a First Nations congregation ground for settlement and salmon fishing. Archaeological evidence from old occupation sites and isotope analysis of human skeletal remains suggest that settlement and migration patterns for indigenous peoples in the Canyon correlated with the seasonal migration patterns of Pacific salmon. During the last deglaciation 4000–6000 years ago, long tongues of ice formed wedges and dams in the river's basin above the canyon, resulting in the formation of large reservoirs and new lakes—creating optimal spawning grounds for salmon. During this inter-glacial period, salmon began to populate the Fraser River and used Hells Gate passage as their route to upstream spawning grounds. Constricted by two steep subvertical granodiorite walls, the incredibly narrow passage and high water velocity made this part of the upstream journey <b>extraordinarily</b> <b>difficult</b> for salmon, and they would hover along the shores of the river or rest in its back-eddies. As a result, Hells Gate’s geology provided the Indigenous fishers with superb opportunities to readily catch salmon congregated at the river’s edge attempting to elude the strong currents and rough waters. Hells Gate became one of the most popular fishing stations along the Fraser River— pre- and post-colonial contact— where large numbers of aboriginal locals, and eventually European settlers, congregated during the summer months to fish for migrating salmon. Standing on adjacent rocks or on specially constructed wooden platforms extending from surrounding cliffs, fishermen would use long dip nets to snatch the salmon. As salmon fishing at Hells Gate was so prolific that, as Matthew Evenden asserts, the aboriginal culture along the Fraser River was built on a “salmon economy.” After Simon Fraser charted the river in the early nineteenth century, it became (and Hells Gate with it) an established corridor between the Pacific Ocean and the interior of what was to become British Columbia. Yet, as Fraser first noted, safe water transportation through the 115 foot wide opening at Hells Gate has proven virtually impossible.|$|E
