5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker's shop and stores {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{members of}} the Somerset Industrial Archaeology Society began {{restoration}} of the site. The Westonzoyland Engine Trust achieved charitable status in 1980 and in 1990 bought the site from the owners, Wessex Water. The structure of the <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> has been stabilised and the pump house and chimney rebuilt. A new exhibition hall has also been built.|$|E

5|$|In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the {{retained}} <b>engine</b> <b>house,</b> boiler house, chimney {{and steam}} engine of Ellenroad Mill, a former 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet. Now operated as an industrial heritage centre, the mill itself {{is no longer}} standing, but the steam engine (the world's largest working steam mill engine) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust. The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning.|$|E
5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E
5|$|Travelling north, the old Town Hall {{building}} at Sunderland Road is a Grade II listed building. Built in 1902 and designed Henry Miller, the Felling U.D.C surveyor, {{this is another}} ashlar and sandstone building in the Baroque style. The five piers and lamp-holders guarding the town hall are also Grade II listed. The Brandling Junction railway building, now an urban studies centre, has been restored and is also a Grade II listed building. At the extreme north of the town at Riverside Park, the former <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> of Tyne Main Colliery, built in 1820, is also a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the water would be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station. Two new station buildings {{opened to}} replace it: a passenger station (the {{centerpiece of the}} new Depot Square) in {{the northeast corner of}} the junction, and a freight station in the southeast which replaced the formerly separate freight houses. In 1897, the junction of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the diamond crossing to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the grade crossing. The old Stony Brook freight house and <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over the junction in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various train movements across the complex junction.|$|E

50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>houses</b> in the Crowns {{section of}} Botallack Mine are set low down the cliffs north of Botallack. There are two <b>engine</b> <b>houses</b> {{here and the}} remains of another pair on the cliff slopes above; the mine extends for about 400 metres out under the Atlantic ocean; the deepest shaft is 250 fathoms (about 500 metres) below sea level. The {{workings}} of Botallack Mine extend inland as far as the St. Just to St. Ives road, and at times included Wheal Cock further to the north-east.|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 1870s until 1885, a Cornish mining engineer, Thomas Corfield, was Superintendent of Sombrero. His duties {{included}} organizing the conveying of the guano {{to a spot}} which was convenient for loading the lighters to take the guano to the ships lying off the island, overseeing the construction of derricks and <b>engine</b> <b>houses,</b> and arranging for the laying of the tram lines for the wagons, which were loaded at the quarries. The guano was just piled in dumps near the <b>engine</b> <b>houses</b> and derricks. There was no semblance of a port and no beach.|$|R
25|$|The Surrey Street Pumping Station is Grade II listed; it {{was built}} in four phases. {{starting}} with the <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> in 1851, with a further <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> in 1862, a further extension in 1876-7 to house a compound horizontal engine and a further extension in 1912.|$|E

25|$|Earlswood Lakes in Earlswood are feeder {{reservoirs}} to the canal. The three lakes {{were built}} between 1821 and 1822 {{and have a}} total capacity of 210 million gallons (950 Megalitres (Ml)). The lakes consist of three separate pools; Terry's, Engine and Windmill Pool. They are retained by earth embankment. Until 1936 the water was pumped into the feeder by a beam engine, whose <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> can still be seen. The feeder was navigable for coal boats to reach the <b>engine</b> <b>house</b> and is now used for moorings.|$|E

25|$|The Roundhouse {{was built}} in 1846 as a {{turntable}} engine shed (or roundhouse) for the London and Birmingham Railway, and {{was known as the}} Great Circular <b>Engine</b> <b>House,</b> or the Luggage <b>Engine</b> <b>House.</b> The original building was built by Branson & Gwyther, using designs by architects Robert B. Dockray and Robert Stephenson. Within ten years locomotives became too long for the building to accommodate, and the Roundhouse was used for various other purposes. The longest period of use (50 years, beginning in 1871) was as a bonded warehouse for Gin distillers W & A Gilbey Ltd.|$|E
