25|$|Goods, supplies, and {{equipment}} were often shared by <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers.</b> Items that were forgotten, broken, or worn out could be bought from a fellow traveler, post, or fort along the way. New iron shoes for horses, mules, and oxen {{were put on}} by blacksmiths found along the way. Equipment repairs and other goods could be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries.

This book reflects Mortensen's fondness for horses. In fact, he bought Uraeus—the horse who played Brego, Aragorn's steed (Roheryn in the books) in The Lord of the Rings movies—as well as TJ, one of the horses who played Hidalgo. He also purchased the stallion that played Arwen's horse, a grey Andalusian stallion named Florian, and gave it to the stunt woman, Jane Abbott, who rode the horse in place of Liv Tyler.|$|E
25|$|It {{is shown}} that York had gained a little freedom {{while on the}} {{expedition}} with Lewis and Clark. It is mentioned in journals that York went on scouting trips and going to trade with villages so he saw what freedom was like while doing that. He might have also been shown respect by Clark because Clark named two geographic discoveries after him; York's Eight Islands and York's Dry Creek. Also they took a poll of where they should stay over one winter and York's opinion was recorded {{even though it was}} last. This shows that York had a taste of freedom and possibly gained some respect by the <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers</b> on the expedition.|$|E

5000|$|In U.S. politics, {{during the}} 1940s and the 1950s, the term <b>fellow</b> <b>traveler</b> (U.S. spelling) was a pejorative {{term for a}} person who was philosophically {{sympathetic}} to Communism, yet was not a formal, [...] "card-carrying member" [...] of the American Communist Party.

500|$|McCarthy {{headed the}} Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953 and 1954, {{and during that}} time used it for a number of his Communist-hunting investigations. McCarthy first {{examined}} allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America, and then turned to the overseas library program of the State Department. Card catalogs of these libraries were searched for works by authors McCarthy deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. Yielding to the pressure, the State Department ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves [...] "material by any controversial persons, Communists, <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers,</b> etc." [...] Some libraries actually burned the newly forbidden books.|$|E
500|$|The {{subcommittee}} {{then turned}} to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves [...] "material by any controversial persons, Communists, <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers,</b> etc." [...] Some libraries went as far as burning the newly forbidden books. Shortly after this, in one of his carefully oblique public criticisms of McCarthy, President Eisenhower urged Americans: [...] "Don't join the book burners....

The remark about fascists was seen as a reference to the conspiratorial Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng who had long been enemies of Diem, but his address attacked all those who had criticised him in the past. He no longer trusted anyone outside his family and considered himself to be a martyr.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story [...] "a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers,</b> and former communists". Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them to the taxpayer. Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The Sacramento Bee termed Nixon [...] "the pet protégé of a special interest group of rich southern Californians... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist." [...] The Pasadena Star-News, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to {{on the grounds that the}} Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid.|$|E
500|$|Grant's first post-war {{assignments}} {{took him}} and Julia to Detroit {{and then to}} Sackets Harbor, New York. In 1852, Grant was ordered to the Pacific Northwest, traveling the New York-Panama oceanic route. Julia, eight months pregnant with Ulysses Jr., did not accompany him. In Panama, an outbreak of cholera among his <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers</b> caused 150 fatalities; Grant arranged makeshift transportation and hospital facilities and helped nurse the sick. In August, Grant arrived in San Francisco, and his next assignment sent him north to Vancouver Barracks in the Oregon Territory (subsequently Washington Territory in March 1853). To supplement a military salary which was inadequate to support his family, Grant speculated and failed at several business ventures, confirming his father's belief {{that he had no}} head for business. Grant assured Julia in a letter that local Native Americans were harmless, while he developed an empathy for the plight of Indians from the [...] "unjust treatment" [...] by white men.|$|E
500|$|From the Ages charted at #25 on the Billboard Heatseekers {{chart for}} a week. Critical {{reaction}} to the album was largely positive, though the album's length was commonly cited as a minor flaw. Metacritic reported a score of 84 based on five reviews, indicating [...] "Universal acclaim". [...] "Though the silence may have been deafening for their small but devoted cadre of fans, the wait was worth every moment," [...] wrote Erik Highter for PopMatters, who described the chemistry between the band members as [...] "near telepathic connections between the players" [...] and the roles of Eginton and Rubalcaba as [...] "pulling" [...] Mitchell back from potential unrestrained solos. He rated the album 8 out of 10, his only complaint being that listeners may consider the title track too long. Conversely, Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media said that the rhythm section did not serve to restrain Mitchell at times, but to [...] "instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, <b>fellow</b> <b>travelers</b> on his odyssey of enthusiasms". He echoed Highter's opinion {{with respect to the}} title track's length, calling it [...] "the one moment [...] where the band's patience might test your own" [...] and asked, regarding the length and repetitive nature of the album as a whole, [...] "is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody?" [...] The length of [...] "From the Ages" [...] was also criticized by Exclaim! reviewer Trystan MacDonald who cited it as the record's [...] "only flaw" [...] and rated the album overall 8 out of 10.|$|E
