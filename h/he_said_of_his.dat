While watching the Kraft Music Hall anthology television show some months before, Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left-handed.

In an interview with E!, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> role: [...] "It sounded like so much fun and that's why I {{wanted to do it}} ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley".

The BJP potentially backed his nomination, saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election. A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam. Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter.

So I'll often hesitate before walking into a new room." [...] He has also spoken about going to therapy to manage his anxieties – OCD, separation anxiety, social anxiety – and depression, the latter of which he struggled with a lot when he was younger, as well as how acting helped him better cope.

In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's voice. I wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{transformative}} {{experience of}} Keable's war was his acquaintance with Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, known as [...] "Jolie", an 18-year-old nurse from a prominent British family (the daughter of William Tenant Buck and Beatrice Elinor Biddulph Beresford; her ancestors included the Dukes of Rutland) {{who was driving}} trucks for the Canadian Lumber Corps when the two met. The pair began a lifelong affair, though Keable did not yet leave his wife. Instead, at the war's close, he returned to Leribe. He remained until 1919, torn by his increasing alienation from the church and his experiences during the war. There he wrote his first novel, Simon Called Peter, in an intensive 20-day spell: [...] "I laid a parson's life bare", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writing, [...] "and didn't care a damn." [...] At last, in 1919, Keable resigned his ministry and left the Anglican church.|$|E

It was bad acting. It was just bad acting. They liked it, god bless them, Star Trek liked it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E
500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
