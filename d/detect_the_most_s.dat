The proposed model of this paper uses grey technique to rank various alternatives and FMEA technique to find important faults. The implementation of the proposed method has been illustrated for an existing example on the literature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to produce an {{extractive}} summary for given set of documents based on word sequence models by extracting Maximal frequent sequences from the given text. The main problem for generating an extractive automatic text summary is to <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> relevant information in the source document. To overcome this problem we have successfully employed the word sequence information from <b>the</b> self-text for <b>detecting</b> <b>the</b> candidate text fragments for composing the summary. To compose the effective summarization we have used mfs technique to extract <b>the</b> <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important terms in the source document and Normalized Google dissimilarity distance for sentence clustering. This simple representation not only diminishes domain and language dependency but also enhances the summarization performance...|$|R
