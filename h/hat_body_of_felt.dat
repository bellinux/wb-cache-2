2500|$|Beginning in 1892, the {{industry}} was revolutionized when the large hat factories began to shift to manufacturing unfinished <b>hat</b> <b>bodies</b> only, and supplying them to smaller hat shops for finishing. So while Danbury produced 24% of America's hats in 1904, the city supplied {{the industry}} with 75% <b>of</b> its <b>hat</b> <b>bodies.</b> [...] The {{turn of the century}} was the heyday of the hatting industry in Danbury, when it became known as the [...] "Hat City" [...] and the [...] "Hatting Capitol of the World". Its motto was [...] "Danbury Crowns Them All". But by the 1920s, the hat industry was in decline. By 1923, only six manufacturers were left in Danbury, which increased the pressure on workers. After WWII, returning GI's went hatless, a trend that accelerated through the 1950s, dooming the city's hat industry. The city's last major hat factory, owned by Stetson, closed in 1964. The last hat was made in Danbury in 1987 when a small factory owned by Stetson closed.|$|R

60|$|About five o'clock, I had {{occasion}} {{to go to the}} Rue de Rivoli, and I found the streets and the garden with much fewer people in them than was usual at that hour. There I heard a rumour that a slight disturbance had taken place on the Boulevard des Italiens, in consequence of a refusal of the Duc de Fitzjames, a leading Carlist, to take off his <b>hat</b> to the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> Lamarque, as he stood at a balcony. I had often met M. de Fitzjames in society, and, although a decided friend of the old regime, I knew his tone of feeling and manners to be too good, to credit a tale so idle. By a singular coincidence, the only time I had met with General Lamarque in private was at a little dinner given by Madame de M----, at which Monsieur de Fitzjames was also a guest. We were but five or six at table, and nothing could be more amicable, or in better taste, than the spirit of conciliation and moderation that prevailed between men so widely separated by opinion. This was not long before Gen. Lamarque was attacked by his final disease, and as there appeared to me to be improbability in the rumour of the affair of the Boulevards, I quite rightly set it down as one of the exaggerations that daily besiege our ears. It being near six, I consequently returned home to dinner, supposing that the day would end as so many had ended before.|$|R

30|$|Subsequently, we {{compared}} the annual number <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> events at Naha between 1857 and 1860 with {{that for the last}} 93  years recorded by the JMA. Between 1857 and 1860, the annual number <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> events was 12.9  events/year including the 1858 earthquake swarm (from October 1858 to January 1859), compared to 8.8  events/year excluding the 1858 swarm. The annual number <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> events since 1923 was 6.0  ±  4.7  events/year (excluding the missing observation period from 1945 to 1951) according to the JMA (JMA Seismic Intensity Catalogue 2017). Therefore, the annual number <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> events between 1857 and 1860 was within the variation range of that since 1923, which suggests that they were similar. However, as shown by the comparison with the “Kyuyo” record, some events may have been omitted in Furet’s record when small felt events occurred continuously. This suggests that the number <b>of</b> small <b>felt</b> events may have been underestimated during the swarm. However, the degree of miscounting is likely to be low, except during the swarm period, with most <b>of</b> the <b>felt</b> events being recorded.|$|R

40|$|Kyrgyz people, {{representing}} the ancient nomadic civilization of Central Asia, manufactured felt from time immemorial and utilized {{it in all}} aspects of their lives. The portable house of Kyrgyz tribes, the yurt, was covered by felt, while the interior decoration and richly ornamented rugs, household goods, clothes, and toys were felt as well. Felt also had sacral meaning and {{played an important role in}} the social life of the tribe. The elected leader was lifted up by tribe members on a piece <b>of</b> white <b>felt,</b> symbolizing public acknowledgment of his power; in funerary traditions a piece <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> was used to wrap the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the deceased. A harmonious perception of the surrounding environment, reflected in ornament and color combinations, as well as a marvelous sense of proportion, was peculiar to ancient Kyrgyz artisans. They transformed ordinary felt items, which were used in everyday nomadic life, into objects of art with high aesthetic value. Design elements, consisting mostly of plant and animal motifs, reflected pre-Islamic, shamanistic beliefs, which involved esoteric knowledge passed from the creator to the concrete recipient. This presentation will give an overview of historic as well as contemporary felt products, produced by Kyrgyz craftsmen, designers and artists in the 20 th and 21 st centuries. The wide array <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> products utilizes traditional felt technologies, as well as mixed techniques with use of other natural fibers, such as cotton and silk, reflecting both Kyrgyz culture and the personality of the artist...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to study the}} behavior of materials subjected to vibratory motion. In particular, {{the study was to}} be an investigation of the properties <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> influencing the performance <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> as a vibration isolator. The performance <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> as an isolation materials cannot be predicted with much satisfaction by the classical theory of vibratory motion and vibration isolation. It was assumed that this might be due to the internal damping <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> and that this damping was not of viscous nature. Therefore, this study was started to determine the nature of the internal friction <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> and the importance of this friction in vibratory motion and vibration isolation. Since the performance <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> as a vibration isolator could not be determined by calculation in the design stage by common procedures sued with other vibration isolation materials, another goal {{of the study was to}} set up a simple test procedure and calculation method that would more nearly give results that agree with actual performance. S. A. E. F- 6 felt was tested as a vibration isolator. This material was subjected to forced vibrations of 0. 025 inch amplitudes with frequencies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cycles per second. Data observed, comprising amplitudes and accelerations of the vibration table and a hanging weight suspended on the felt material, were used to calculate the transmissibility of this material. Each specimen <b>of</b> <b>felt</b> was subjected to forced vibrations once daily over a period of eight days because a pronounced creep effect was observed. The sustained testing was an attempt to determine how long a period of time was required or steady state conditions to be reached. These sustained tests also determined what effects the creep had on the physical characteristics of this material. Advisor: W. L. De Baufr...|$|R
