5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} {{far side}} of the Moon and was found by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It is an area of concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E
5|$|The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 {{devastated the}} city of Galveston and heavily damaged {{communities}} around the bay (according to some estimates the Bay Area death toll may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as 2000). Bridges between Galveston and the mainland were destroyed. Communities along the shoreline declined for some time as economic growth moved inland and Houston became the dominant economic center in the region. The region received a population boost from some Galveston refugees who relocated to the mainland following the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, the sail is not thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> a result of the arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of death tolls were {{reported}} by many different sources. Then-Mexico president Luis Echeverria {{as well as the}} HPC and EPHC claimed that 435people died during the hurricane. It was initially stated that 630people had died during the storm; however, this total does not include victims discovered by the Mexican army. During the afternoon of October 2, the local government had placed the confirmed death toll at 397. Two days later, the Bangor Daily News reported that the number of bodies found dead ranged from 400to750. By late October3, Mexican officials and a Red Cross spokesperson reported that 650bodies had been found. Meanwhile, a military search operation claimed that the death toll of the hurricane was1,050. By October6, local officials had abandoned efforts to retrieve additional bodies, citing safety reasons. Even though 650people were confirmed to have died during Hurricane Liza, officials estimated that at least 1,000people died. Within a week after Hurricane Liza, some feared 10,000people perished. In addition, some modern estimates suggest that the toll could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as7,000.|$|E

5|$|About 1558, {{according}} to a date on a fireplace, Bess of Hardwick and her third husband, Sir John's son Sir William St Loe, added a north east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses. Sir William St Loe was a soldier, politician and courtier. His official positions included Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, Chief Butler of England and Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He died suddenly without male issue in 1564/5, which Mary S. Lovell suggests may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> a result of poisoning by his younger brother. All his property was left Bess, {{to the detriment of}} his daughters and brother. When Bess died in 1608 the house was left to her son Charles Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|Although {{more common}} since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons occurred during 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{accurate}} account of how many Indonesians died, they died in far greater numbers than the Europeans. Estimates of Indonesian deaths in fighting range from 45,000 to 100,000 and civilian dead exceeded 25,000 and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as 100,000. A total of 1,200 British soldiers were killed or went missing in Java and Sumatra in 1945 and 1946, most of them Indian soldiers. More than 5,000 Dutch soldiers {{lost their lives in}} Indonesia between 1945 and 1949. Many Japanese died; in Bandung alone, 1,057 died, only half of whom died in actual combat, the rest killed in rampages by Indonesians. Seven million people were displaced on Java and Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|Amy was {{considered}} one of the worst typhoons to strike the Philippines on record. Making its initial landfall along with the concurrent eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin, the typhoon disrupted volcanic relief operations and forced the displacement of victims already displaced by the volcano. Cebu City suffered the worst impacts of Amy– most of the city's buildings were heavily damaged, and 29people died in the city. Strong winds and rainfall in the city associated with Amy also set records which still remain unbroken today. Damage there was estimated at 560million Philippine pesos. Along the east coast of Leyte, where Amy initially struck, ninety percent of homes were destroyed, and a large swath of coconut plantations were wiped out. In Panay, located on the western side of the Philippines, at least a thousand homes were destroyed in 41towns. Overall, Amy caused $30million in damage, and at least 556fatalities, though the final death toll may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as 991, making the typhoon one of the deadliest in modern Philippine history. An additional 50,000people were displaced.|$|E
5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), winds could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> high as 150km/h (95mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the year}} 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups.

The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though {{not all of the}} Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both {{the north and the south}} side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.|$|E
