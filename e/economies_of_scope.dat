25|$|It {{seems that}} around 1880 {{there was a}} change in {{manufacturing}} practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products. Those companies (especially in metalworking) attempted to achieve success through <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility. The managers now needed information {{on the effect of}} product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information. A variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time. However, the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed. In particular, it was the need for audited accounts that sealed the fate of managerial cost accounting. The dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions, and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost' have distorted effective management 'cost' accounting since that time. This is particularly true of inventory.|$|E

However, {{we do not believe that}} the technical question <b>of</b> <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> has been resolved, as their analysis seems to suggest. Technological advances have fundamentally altered the architectural models and economics of local loop design of an integrated broadband network, shifting the focus from fibre-to-the-home towards fibre-to-the-kerb.

2500|$|Some call {{attention}} to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope,</b> and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on IP. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope.</b> While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the <b>economies</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that [...] "some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies," [...] Commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.|$|E

30|$|The need to financially support metro {{enterprises}} {{stems from}} the amplified global enthusiasm for sustainable modes of transport. This paper analyzes the formulation and practice of the profit model based on quasi-marketing initiated within Shenzhen Metro in China. In contrast to previous studies based on a single theory, this paper employs an integrated approach in optimizing gains. Metro enterprises have peculiar attributes such as supply of quasi-public service products, positive externalities, heavy assets, low profit, <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> scale, and <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope.</b> Therefore, in order to effectuate sustainable growth, the author has put forward three methods for the profit model based on the quasi-market principle: firstly, generate internal gains of positive externalities through the enterprise’s market operation on government-allocated resources; secondly, balance cost and income by modifying the accounting policies on fixed assets depreciation and financing interest; and lastly, maximize <b>economy</b> <b>of</b> <b>scope</b> by enhancing synergy between different business segments and sub-businesses of the same segment in the enterprise. In practice, these methods are carried out in Shenzhen Metro with innovative methods that comprise “metro plus property”, “member plus fund” and “entity plus virtual”. This study concludes that the advantages of quasi-marketing include the optimization of resources and the success in overcoming the financial restraints in metro enterprises. Through the high applicability in Shenzhen Metro, it is shown that this quasi-market principle-based profit model could enable metro enterprises to achieve self-development and sustainability.|$|R
