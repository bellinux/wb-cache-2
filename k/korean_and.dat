The study said that [...] "common ancestry and/or extensive gene flow" [...] historically between <b>Koreans</b> <b>and</b> Japanese appears to be [...] "likely" [...] and results in a lot of difficulty finding population-specific alleles that could assist in differentiating <b>Koreans</b> <b>and</b> Japanese.|$|R
