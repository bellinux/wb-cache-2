50|$|There {{are other}} forms of {{internal}} energy besides the kinetic energy of translational motion. As {{can be seen in}} the animation at right, molecules are complex objects; they are a population of atoms and thermal agitation can strain their internal chemical bonds in three different ways: via rotation, bond length, and bond angle movements. These are all types of internal degrees of freedom. This makes molecules distinct from monatomic substances (consisting of individual atoms) like the noble gases helium and argon, which have only the three translational degrees of freedom. Kinetic energy is stored in molecules' internal degrees of freedom, which gives them an internal temperature. Even though these motions are called internal, the external portions of molecules still move—rather like the jiggling of a stationary water balloon. This permits the two-way exchange of kinetic energy between internal motions and translational motions with each molecular collision. Accordingly, as energy is removed from molecules, both their <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature</b> (the temperature derived from the kinetic energy of translational motion) and their internal temperature simultaneously diminish in equal proportions. This phenomenon is described by the equipartition theorem, which states that for any bulk quantity of a substance in equilibrium, the kinetic energy of particle motion is evenly distributed among all the active (i.e. unfrozen) degrees of freedom available to the particles. Since the internal temperature of molecules are usually equal to their <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperature,</b> the distinction is usually of interest only in the detailed study of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) phenomena such as combustion, the sublimation of solids, and the diffusion of hot gases in a partial vacuum.|$|E

In this work, we study velocity fluctuations in a collisional flow near jamming using event-driven simulations.

This version of record is available online at: [URL] Reproduced with Permission from Astronomy and Astrophysics, ?? ESO 2014. Aims. The Pipe Nebula {{is characterized by}} a low star-formation rate and is therefore an ideal environment to explore how initial conditions, including core characteristics, affect star-formation efficiencies. Methods. In a continued study of the molecular core population of the Pipe Nebula, we present a molecular-line survey of 52 cores. Previous research has shown a variety of different chemical evolutionary stages among the cores. Using the Mopra Radio Telescope, we observed the ground rotational transitions of HCO+, H 13 CO+, HCN, H 13 CN, HNC, and N 2 H+. These data are complemented with near-infrared extinction maps to constrain the column densities, effective dust temperatures derived from Herschel data, and NH 3 -based gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Results. The target cores are located across the nebula, span visual extinctions between 5 and 67 mag, and effective dust temperatures (averaged along the lines of sight) between 13 and 19 K. The extinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in constant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of magnitude for a given molecule. The effective dust <b>temperatures</b> and gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures</b> are correlated, but the effective dust temperatures are consistently higher than the gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Combining the molecular line and temperature data, we find that N 2 H+ is only detected toward the coldest and densest cores, while other lines show no correlation with these core properties. Conclusions. Within this large sample, N 2 H+ is the only species to exclusively trace the coldest and densest cores, in agreement with chemical considerations. In contrast, the common high-density tracers HCN and HNC are present in a majority of the cores, demonstrating the utility of these molecules for characterizing cores over a wide range of extinctions. The correlation between the effective dust temperatures and the gas <b>kinetic</b> <b>temperatures</b> suggests that the former are dominated by dust that is both dense and thermodynamically coupled to the dense gas traced by NH 3.
