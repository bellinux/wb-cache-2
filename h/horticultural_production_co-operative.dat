On the other hand, production under foil was insufficiently developed. Distribution of glasshouses, hotbeds, and foil tunnels was characterized with a big spatial differentiation. The hothouse area was mainly used for cultivation of vegetables, first of all tomatoes and cucumbers. Production of vegetables per one inhabitant of towns exceeded by over 40 per cent the national level. Forecast of the <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> development till 1990 envisages that the hothouse area will reach 700 ha, with the biggest exparasion to be noted in the case of foil tunnels and the smallest in hotbeds. The highest increment rate will be observed in provinces of Konin and Włocławek, and the smallest in those of Łódź and Kalisz.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} a {{significant}} influence on New Zealand <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> and therefore, relevant adaptation responses {{should be taken to}} cope with the impacts of climate change. The New Zealand government has introduced several policies on climate change for the agricultural industry, such as the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), Fund and technology development and transfer in order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate farmers’ adaptation responses. However, many of these policies are related to dairy rather than <b>horticultural</b> <b>production.</b> Therefore, it is not certain whether these policies are being implemented effectively at <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> level or not. The purpose of this research is to identify the impacts of climate change on <b>horticultural</b> crop <b>production</b> and how government policies on climate change have been implemented at <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> level. The study used qualitative research methods and a case study approach to collect and analyse data. The case study was implemented at seven farms: a citrus orchard in Gisborne, a vineyard in Nelson, four vegetable farms in Manawatu, and an apple orchard in Hawke’s Bay. Primary data were mainly obtained from semi-directive interviews with farmers and government officers and field observations. Secondary data were collected through literature reviews. The literature reviewed showed that climate change is occurring in New Zealand. Annual average temperatures have increased by 0. 9 °C over the last 100 years and annual rainfall has been changing with an increase in the west. However, field interviews revealed that most farmers felt that climate was not changing and didn’t change their farming activities. Also, there was no significant impact of climate change on horticultural crops, including citrus, wine grapes, apples, and vegetables. As a result, most farmers interviewed had little concern about climate change and were not doing any particular adaptation responses for climate change. In addition, from field interviews, government policies and activities seemed to be less effective at <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> levels. Many farmers interviewed had little knowledge on government policies on climate change and were not involved in those government policies and activities. This is because the farmers tend not to pay strong attention to long-term issues or threats, such as climate change. And, many New Zealand government policies on climate change are focusing on mitigation of GHG emissions from livestock and pasture. Also, local councils’ resources and finance are generally insufficient to meet the full demands around the issue. In addition, New Zealand policies on climate change have a limited comprehensive approach. Thus, it is recommended that the Government needs to develop broader policies for enhancing horticultural industries’ adaptability and resilience to climate change. Also, the Government needs to develop comprehensive and long-term strategies including considering relocation of production to new regions. In addition, the central government needs to provide more financial support to local government in order to improve their capability of undertaking adaptation activities to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the main}} goal for modern <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> is the {{increase}} of quality. Furthermore, in consideration of the new consumer demand, always more attracted by a diet based on a larger consumption of fruit and vegetables without risks of pesticides residues and with increased nutritional value, new important features {{in addition to the}} traditional quality attributes are now requested. For a program of qualification and valorisation of modern <b>horticultural</b> <b>productions,</b> it is fundamental a study of the major quality determinants organized by following a heuristic approache useful to identify the contribution of each factor in defining the quality of the product. The genetic knowledge applied to all available techniques useful for the creation of new genetic variability surely represent the most important starting point for the release of new varieties with increased nutritional quality without limitation in plant productivity. About agronomic practices, new opportunities are offered by the sustainable management of the production factors able to improve the plant-environment interaction, to well address the reduction of inputs needed for the production, and finally to induce specific stress conditions able to promote higher quality at reduced inputs. Much more attention is also addressed to the post-harvest technologies, this because of the increased needs to guarantee the preservation of the high quality obtained in the field until the consumer use. Taking in account such complexity of the <b>horticultural</b> <b>production</b> systems and examples of some major model crops, an outlook of the main determinants and potential valorisation of high quality horticultural products are attempted...|$|R
