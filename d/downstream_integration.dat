However, Merker {{points out that the}} explanatory work is done by the <b>downstream</b> <b>integration</b> of synchronized signals in post-synaptic neurons: [...] "It is, however, by no means clear what is to be understood by 'binding by synchrony' other than the threshold advantage conferred by synchrony at, and only at, sites of axonal convergence onto single dendritic trees..." [...] In other words, although synchrony is proposed as a way of explaining binding on a distributed, rather than a convergent, basis the justification rests on what happens at convergence. Signals for two features are proposed as bound by synchrony because synchrony effects downstream convergent interaction. Any theory of phenomenal binding based on this sort of computational function would seem to follow the same principle. The phenomenality would entail convergence, if the computational function does.|$|E

Process integration looks for the integration of all operations involved in the production of fuel ethanol. This can be achieved through the development of integrated bioprocesses that combine different steps into one single unit. Thus, reaction–separation integration by removing ethanol from the zone where the biotransformation takes place, offers several opportunities for increasing product yield and consequently reducing product costs. Other forms of integration may significantly decrease energetic costs of specific flowsheet configurations for ethanol production. Process integration is gaining more and more interest due to the advantages related to its application in the case of ethanol production: reduction of energy costs, decrease in the size and number of process units, intensification of the biological and <b>downstream</b> processes. <b>Integration</b> of fermentation and separation processes for reduction of product inhibition, development of efficient cogeneration technologies using cane bagasse, development of CBP, application of membrane technology (e.g. for ethanol removal or dehydration) are examples of process integration.|$|R

Knowledge of the causative genetic defect most often does not enable treatment; therefore, causal intermediates between genotype and phenotype constitute valuable candidates for molecular intervention points that can be therapeutically targeted. Mapping genetic determinants of gene expression levels (also known as expression quantitative trait loci or eQTL studies) is frequently used for this purpose, yet distinguishing causation from correlation remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this challenge using extensive, multi-environment gene expression and fitness profiling of hundreds of genetically diverse yeast strains, {{in order to identify}} truly causal intermediate genes that condition fitness in a given environment.
