60|$|The half-seen man {{assured him}} that it was, and then {{followed}} {{him back into the}} lighted room, where he sat down and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> from which a red trickle dripped down his arm.|$|E
60|$|Warburton <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and impelled Lee to silence. In that gesture Neale {{read what}} stirred {{him to his}} soul. It was coming. He saw it again in General Lodge's fleeting, rare smile. He held his breath. The old pang throbbed in his breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only my hind feet," [...] said Paddy. [...] "They have webs {{between the}} toes just as Honker's have. That is for swimming. But {{there are no}} webs between my fingers." [...] He <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> for all to see. Sure enough, the fingers were free.|$|E
60|$|Sir Patrick <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b> Before <b>a</b> word {{more could}} be said between them they were silenced again by another interruption.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked into}} her eyes, holding her hand, and she felt his body trembling. She knew {{he was about to}} speak, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|At this Dougall <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> clenched <b>hand,</b> {{hard and}} knuckly from honest toil, that {{was nearly as}} big as a small ham. Regarding it with much {{complacency}} he said, slowly:-- ...|$|R
60|$|The tall figure {{bowed and}} <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and for a}} moment there was silence; then a clear voice rang out, and Grahame tried to catch the sonorous Castilian words. He was too far off, and some escaped him, but he heard enough to gather that it was a grim {{indictment}} of the rulers of the country. The man spoke with fire and passion, using lavish gestures, and the cries that answered showed that he could work upon the feelings of the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Prison-castles be {{not wanting}} here,' replied Margaret with a sigh. Then, as Elleen <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> in delight at {{the thrill of}} a {{neighbouring}} nightingale, she cried, 'What is yon sing-song, seesaw, gurgling bird to our own bonnie laverock, soaring away to the sky, without making such a wark of tuning his pipes, and never thinking himself too dainty and tender for a wholesome frost or two! So Jamie sent you off to seek for husbands here, did he? Couldna ye {{put up with a}} leal Scot, like Glenuskie there?' ...|$|E
60|$|By and by {{the camp}} tasks of the men {{appeared}} to be ended, and all gathered near the fire to lounge and smoke and talk. Glenn and Hutter engaged in interested conversation with two Mexicans, evidently sheep herders. If the wind and cold had not made Carley so uncomfortable she might have found the scene picturesque. How black the night! She could scarcely distinguish the sky at all. The cedar branches swished in the wind, and from the gloom came a low sound of waves lapping a rocky shore. Presently Glenn <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand</b> to the others. [...] "You {{went off}} into a quiet little trance, that's all. I was mistaken. Either you are a psychic or {{you should have been}} an actress." ...|$|R
60|$|Logan {{was about}} to speak again, when his client <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> gently deprecating <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Badgery <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> white <b>hand.</b> [...] "No more, no more. I find {{literature}} quite depressing enough. I {{insist that}} life at least shall {{be a little}} gayer. Did you tell him I wanted him to paint my room?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{wanted to}} ask {{if she were a}} Mormon by religion, but the {{question}} seemed curious and unnecessary. His interest was aroused; he realized suddenly that he had found pleasure in her low voice; it was new and strange, unlike any woman's voice he had ever heard; and he regarded her closely. He had only time for a glance at her straight, clean-cut profile, when she turned startled eyes on him, eyes black as the night. And they were eyes that looked through and beyond him. She <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> slowly bent toward the wind, and whispered: ...|$|E
6000|$|The Bavarian doctor {{turned his}} face from the bed at their entrance. He was bending over Sir Isaac. He held up one hand as if to arrest them; his other was engaged with his patient. [...] "No," [...] he said. His {{attention}} {{went back to the}} sick man, and he remained very still in that position, leaving Lady Harman to note for the first time how broad and flat he was both between his shoulders and between his ears. Then his face came round slowly, he relinquished something heavy, stood up, <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "Zu sp√§t," [...] he whispered, as though he too was surprised. He sought in his mind for English and then found his phrase: [...] "He has gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|From {{time to time}} he <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> and ten {{others were}} at once elevated, showing that the watchers were as {{vigilant}} as himself. It was, he thought, about one o'clock {{when he heard a}} faint creaking sound. It did not seem to him to be in the hall itself, but in a room adjoining it, the doors having all been left open. He rose to his feet, touched Beorn, who lay a pace or two away, and stole noiselessly out, grasping his sword in his hand. He stopped before he got to {{the open door of the}} next room and listened. All seemed perfectly quiet. He stood motionless, until a minute later there was a sudden shout, followed almost instantly by a clash of arms.|$|E
6000|$|But Wicks <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> shaking <b>hand.</b> [...] "Not that either, boys," [...] he pleaded. [...] "Think of {{the other}} buffer, and let him down easy. If I'm like this, just fancy what Topelius is. If he heard us singing out, he'd have the staggers." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl silenced him, {{and though}} {{the next two or}} three minutes were, perhaps, as {{unpleasant}} as any Jimmy had ever spent in his life, it was with a certain deep relief that he heard his sister out. Before she stopped she <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> white <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Kitty <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b> [...] "Grandmamma {{sometimes}} listens at doors," [...] she whispered; [...] "I don't {{want her}} to hear me." [...] She waited a little longer, and then approached Mr. Sarrazin, frowning mysteriously. [...] "Take me up on your knee," [...] she said. [...] "There's something wrong {{going on in this}} house." ...|$|R
60|$|Once more, as she {{had seen}} them when the furrows were bare at seed time, and there was {{apparently}} only ruin in store for those who raised the Eastern people's bread, lines of dusty teams came plodding down the rise. They advanced in echelon, keeping their time and distance with a military precision, but {{in place of the}} harrows, the tossing arms of the binders flashed and swung. The wheat went down before them, their wake was strewn with gleaming sheaves, and one man came foremost swaying in the driving-seat of a rattling machine. His face was the color of a Blackfeet's, and she could see the darkness of his neck above the loose-fronted shirt, and a bare blackened arm that was raised to hold the tired beasts to their task. Their trampling, and the crash and rattle that swelled in slow crescendo, drowned the murmur of the wheat, until one of the machines stood still, and the leader, turning a moment in his saddle, <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand.</b> Then those that came behind swung into changed formation, passed, and fell into indented line again, while Colonel Barrington nodded with grim approval.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Dr. Brighton-Pomfrey in a {{tone that}} defined his own {{position}} with remorseless clearness. [...] "Exactly." [...] And he <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> flat, arresting <b>hand.</b> [...] .|$|R
6000|$|Winston laughed, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> lean brown <b>hand.</b> [...] "All I {{ever had}} until {{less than a}} year ago, I earned with that. I'll be ready for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wagner drew back, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b> Before {{she could}} express herself in words, Jack's quick ear caught {{the sound of}} {{footsteps}} approaching the door. [...] "Is she coming back?" [...] he cried, still suspicious of Madame Fontaine. Mrs. Wagner instantly opened the door, and found herself {{face to face with}} Joseph the footman.|$|R
6000|$|But Lanyon's face changed, and he <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{trembling}} <b>hand.</b> [...] "I {{wish to see}} or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll," [...] {{he said in a}} loud, unsteady voice. [...] "I {{am quite}} done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead." ...|$|R
50|$|Sculptures {{are found}} on the {{southwest}} side of the building. The Hand of God, dedicated to Albert Campbell, depicts <b>a</b> man <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> and is mounted on a mast; it is located south across Borough Drive. Frank Faubert Forest, a wooded area south of the Civic Centre is named for Scarborough's last mayor, Frank Faubert.|$|R
6000|$|The gentleman {{with the}} large face <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{soothing}} <b>hand.</b> [...] "Peace, peace," [...] he said. [...] "I did not interrupt you. I annihilated you. Why did you presume to talk to artists about art? Go away, or I shall have to say Bah! again. Go and have a fit. Leave us--two rare souls who may not meet again--to our talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's her ladyship! {{make room}} for her ladyship!" [...] But Claude <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b> He had just {{arranged}} a masterpiece,--half-a-dozen of the prettiest children, sitting beneath a broken boat, on spars, sails, blocks, lobster-pots, and what not, arranged in picturesque confusion; while the black-bearded sea-kings round were promising them rock and bulls-eyes, if they would only sit still like [...] "gude maids." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for the dynamite!" [...] {{the captain}} said, cheerily, {{proceeding}} to lower a small object overboard {{by a single}} wire, while he <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his <b>hand</b> <b>a</b> third time to bespeak silence and attention.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand.</b> [...] "Sh! now that's between us. There {{are those}} younger than I, 'tis true, {{but there is}} a kind of saving grace in money. I can take you all out of this daily tile like winkin'--all you need to do is to say the wan word and we'll have a house in Colorado Springs or Denver--or even in New York. For what did you think I left me {{business}} on the busiest day of every week? It was to see your sweet daughter, and I came this time to ask her to go back with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|During evening prayers, which follow {{every night}} {{immediately}} on food, {{her face was}} a study of mutiny. She went to bed early. It was rather late when we broke up--for once old Ford had been talking of his squatter's life. As we came out, Dan <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his <b>hand.</b> <b>A</b> dog was barking. [...] "It's Lass," [...] he said. [...] "She'll wake Pasiance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Una had {{acquired}} a hesitating fondness for the mute gentleness of the others, and it infuriated her that this insect should spoil their picnic. But after dinner Phil Benson dallied over to her, sat {{on the arm of}} her chair, and said: [...] "I'm awfully sorry that I make such a bum hit with you, Miss Golden. Oh, I can see I do, all right. You're the only one here that can understand. Somehow it seems to me--you aren't like other women I know. There's something--somehow it's different. A--a temperament. You dream about higher things than just food and clothes. Oh," [...] he <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> deprecating <b>hand,</b> [...] "don't deny it. I'm mighty serious about it, Miss Golden. I can see it, even if you haven't waked up to it as yet." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>held</b> <b>up</b> her <b>hand.</b> <b>A</b> slow pulsation, {{that might}} have been the dull, labored beating of their own hearts, was making itself felt {{throughout}} the little cottage. It came nearer,--a deep regular inspiration that seemed slowly to fill and possess the whole tranquil summer twilight. It was nearer still--was abreast of the house--passed--grew fainter and at last died away like a deep-drawn sigh. It was the down boat, that was now separating Mr. Hamlin and his protegee, even as it had once brought them together.|$|R
6000|$|The morning, however, did {{not pass}} without an {{interesting}} incident. Brackton approached Slone with an offer that he {{take charge of the}} freighting between the Ford and Durango. [...] "What would I do with Wildfire?" [...] was Slone's questioning reply, and Brackton <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his <b>hands.</b> <b>A</b> later incident earned more of Slone's attention. He had observed a man in Brackton's store, and it chanced that this man heard Slone's reply to Brackton's offer, and he said: [...] "You'll sure need to corral thet red stallion. Grandest hoss I ever seen!" ...|$|R
60|$|With an exhilaration {{so great}} that she wanted sorely to laugh aloud she walked out through her big open gates and into the general {{publicity}} of Putney Hill. Why had she not done as much years ago? How long she had been, working up to this obvious thing! She hadn't been out in such complete possession of herself since she had been <b>a</b> schoolgirl. She <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> beautifully gloved <b>hand</b> to <b>a</b> private motor-car going downhill and then to an engaged taxi going up, {{and then with a}} slightly dashed feeling, picked up her skirt and walked observantly downhill. Her reason dispelled a transitory impression that these two vehicles were on Sir Isaac's side against her.|$|R
6000|$|... "He will be {{here before}} long now," [...] said Van Helsing, who had been {{consulting}} his pocketbook. [...] "Nota bene, in Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax. That means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only suspicious, and he went from Carfax first {{to the place where}} he would suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next. This took him some time, for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your arms! Be ready!" [...] He <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> warning <b>hand</b> as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.|$|R
5000|$|Swan {{achieved}} local fame as {{an artist}} in the 1950s. Her paintings from this period are loosely associated with the Boston Expressionist school, although her themes tended to be gentler than those of Jack Levine and others working in that style. In a 1957 review of her show at the Boris Mirski Gallery, critic Edgar Driscoll marveled at her ability to render tranquil domestic scenes, featuring sleeping children or nursing infants, in a creative way: [...] "It is a tender, touching showing...Yet the artist, through strong color and off-beat compositions, carefully avoids over-sentimentalizing or slipping into the banal." [...] One of her best known paintings from this period, [...] "Baby", shows her infant son Aaron <b>held</b> <b>up</b> by <b>a</b> man's <b>hand,</b> presumably her husband's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{as you are}} now--be so good as {{to remain}} so; sitting just that way--leaning back with a smile in your eyes and {{one hand on the}} sofa beside you and {{supporting}} you a little. I shall stick a flower into the other hand--let it lie in your lap just as it is. Keep that thing on your head--it's admirably uncovered: do you call such an unconsidered trifle a bonnet?--and let your head fall back a little. There it is--it's found. This time I shall really do something, and it will be as different as you like from that other crazy job. Here we go!" [...] It was in these irrelevant but earnest words that Nick responded to his sitter's uttered vagaries, of which her charming tone and countenance diminished the superficial acerbity. He <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his <b>hands</b> <b>a</b> moment, to fix her in her limits, and in a few minutes had a happy sense of having begun to work.|$|R
