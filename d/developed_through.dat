At the end of the season, Lord was taken on at County as a scout and development team coach; he would later follow Gannon to Motherwell.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Carolina Marsh Tacky Association was formed.

The breed registry became a closed registry on August 18, 2010, and is maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Pedigree Registry. Although closed, outside horses can be registered upon proof of origin, visual inspection and DNA confirmation of parentage.|$|E

5|$|Most Limousin cattle have a {{coloration}} that {{varies from}} light wheat to darker golden-red.

In addition to altering natural coloration, other traits, such as polled (a genetic lack of horns), {{have been introduced}} through cross breeding. Angus cattle have been the dominant source of black and polled genes now present in graded-up high content Limousins found throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{was created}} in the marshes of the Poitou region, {{especially}} around Luçon, La Rochelle, Melle and Niort. It was <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> a mixture of human and natural selection to the marshy area that it inhabited. Although described as a draft horse, it was not selected for draft purposes, and was never popular for that use.|$|E

5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth College fielded {{its first}} {{football}} team in 1881, {{when the school}} challenged Amherst College to a two-game series. They won the first contest, one touchdown to none, and tied the second. The following year, the team played their first major opponent when they traveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts and played the Harvard Crimson. Dartmouth was blown out 53–0, and a rivalry with Harvard formed. The Dartmouth football team <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> the 1880s, skipping the 1885 season but challenging several major opponents. Prior to Wurtenburg's arrival, the school had won four Triangular Football League championships in seven years. Wallace Moyle was the first coach hired by the program; he served in that position during the two years before Wurtenburg's appointment and led the school to a 9–7 record.|$|E
5|$|During the pupal stage, the {{morphology}} of {{the adult}} is <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> elaboration from larval structures. The general aspect {{of the adult}} is visible before the outer surface hardens – the head, resting on the thorax, the eyes, antennae (brought forward over the head), the wings brought over the thorax and the six legs between the wings and the abdomen. Among the features discernible in the head region of a pupa are sclerites, sutures, pilifers, mandibles, eye-pieces, antennae, palpi and the maxillae. The pupal thorax displays the three thoracic segments, legs, wings, tegulae, alar furrows and axillary tubercles. The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus on free trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
5|$|Once {{leaving the}} city of Buffalo, NY5 heads east through the densely {{populated}} suburban town of Amherst, including the hamlets of Snyder and Eggertsville and the village of Williamsville and is heavily <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> {{the entire length of}} the town, particularly at the intersection with Transit Road (NY78). In the town of Clarence, the road dips into a significant depression known as Clarence Hollow. Once leaving Clarence, NY5 goes through predominantly rural areas until reaching {{the city of}} Batavia in Genesee County, closely paralleling the New York State Thruway through much of the county. The road travels eastward until reaching Livingston County and the village of Caledonia.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In {{stark contrast to the}} industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game {{in tandem with the}} movie, Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper made sure to give the {{developers}} as much time as they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was <b>developed</b> <b>through</b> viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E
