This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy.

5|$|Modifications to {{the house}} include the {{addition}} of a large pediment-shaped dormer that projects <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main roof and is lighted by a rectangular double window.

5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie {{in the direction of}} the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E

5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28. The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm at the time. Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C). That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast. The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995season, as it turned northward {{in response to the}} nearby low.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E

5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The Organic Law No. 99-56 of 30 June 1999, adopted on 3 July by the Chamber of Deputies, formalized the Tunisian flag for {{the first}} time in law, {{clarifying}} Article 4 of the constitution. The flag is in the form of a red rectangle with a width equal to two-thirds of its length. In the middle of the flag is a white disk whose diameter is equal to one-third of the length of the rectangle and whose center is located at the intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle. A red five-pointed star is located to the right of the disk, whose center is at a distance equal to one-thirtieth of the length of the flag <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disk.|$|E
5|$|The local Byzantine {{governors}} {{were left}} alone {{to cope with the}} Bulgarian threat but they were unable to stop the Bulgarians. The positions of the brothers Samuil and Aron (the two eldest brothers David and Moses died soon after the beginning of the great offensive in 976) were strengthened not only by the rebellion of Skleros but also the neglect of the former Byzantine Emperor John Tzimisces towards the southwestern Bulgarian lands. After the fall of Preslav and the north-eastern areas of the Bulgarian Empire his main priority became the war against the Arabs in Syria, which gave the Bulgarians time to prepare for a long struggle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining parts of the Empire around the Ohrid and Prespa Lakes.|$|E

There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end.
