5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a <b>grazing</b> <b>animal</b> against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5â€“15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E

2500|$|Alfalfa is a small-seeded crop, {{and has a}} slowly growing seedling, {{but after}} several months of establishment, forms a tough [...] "crown" [...] {{at the top of}} the root system.

2500|$|The second {{treatise}} {{is quite}} different in structure than the remaining books, states Olivelle, as it does not truly embox fables. It {{is a collection of}} adventures of four characters: a crow (scavenger, not a predator, airborne habits), a mouse (tiny, underground habits), a turtle (slow, water habits) and a deer (a <b>grazing</b> <b>animal</b> viewed by other animals as prey, land habits). The overall focus of the book is the reverse of the first book. Its theme is to emphasize the importance of friendships, team work, and alliances. It teaches, [...] "weak animals with very different skills, working together can accomplish what they cannot when they work alone", according to Olivelle. United through their cooperation and in their mutual support, the fables describe how they are able to outwit all external threats and prosper.|$|E
2500|$|The Portlethen Moss is a {{recognised}} {{nature preserve}} by the Scottish Wildlife Trust (with designation PLM076) and the Aberdeenshire Council. [...] While peat cutting {{was conducted in}} prehistoric and Middle Ages times, {{there has been no}} harvesting of peat in the modern era. [...] There is some ongoing loss of moss habitat from cattle grazing, but the most significant threat is from ongoing land development pressure; in fact, half of the Portlethen Moss has been lost to urban (low density) land development by the town of Portlethen during the period 1985 to 2005. [...] Trampling is considered an insignificant threat due to the small animal or human presence in the existing nature reserve area; furthermore, cattle grazing, while ongoing, is deemed a much lesser current threat than population expansion pressure. [...] Enrichment (addition of <b>grazing</b> <b>animal</b> [...] manure) is not a major issue due to the low density of animals. [...] As a net result damage to the primordial moss is considered extensive and widespread by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. [...] The raised bog habitat of the Portlethen Moss is also protected by the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan.|$|E
60|$|On the {{way back}} from the sick mare, Dick paused once to listen to the restless stamp of Mountain Lad and his fellows in the {{stallion}} barn. In the quiet air, from somewhere up the hills, came the ringing of a single bell from some <b>grazing</b> <b>animal.</b> A cat's-paw of breeze fanned him with sudden balmy warmth. All the night was balmy with the faint and almost aromatic scent of ripening grain and drying grass. The stallion stamped again, and Dick, with a deep breath and realization that never had he more loved it all, looked up and circled the sky-line where the crests of the mountains blotted the field of stars.|$|E

60|$|Some birds when {{breeding}} exhibit great anxiety at {{the approach}} of any animal to the nest; but even when most excited they behave very differently towards herbivorous mammals and those which they know to be at all times the enemies of their kind. The nest of a ground-breeding species may be endangered by the proximity of a goat, sheep, deer, or any <b>grazing</b> <b>animal,</b> but the birds do not winnow the air above it, scream, make threatening dashes at its head, and try to lead it away as they would do {{in the case of}} a dog or fox. When small birds dash at and violently attack large animals and man in defence of their nest, even though the nest may not have been touched, the action appears to be purely instinctive and involuntary, almost unconscious, in fact. Acts of this kind are more often seen in humming-birds than in birds of other families; and humming-birds do not appear to discriminate between rapacious and herbivorous mammals. When they see a large animal moving about they fly close to and examine it for a few moments, then dart away; if it comes too near the nest they will attack it, or threaten an attack. When examining their nests I have had humming-birds dash into my face. The action is similar to that of a stingless, solitary carpenter bee, common in La Plata: a round burly insect with a shining steel-blue body: when the tree or bush in which this bee has its nest is approached by a man it darts about in an eccentric manner, humming loudly, and at intervals remains suspended motionless for ten or fifteen seconds at a height of seven or eight yards above his head; suddenly it dashes quick as lightning into his face, inflicting a sharp blow. The bee falls, as if stunned, a space of a couple of feet, then rises again to repeat the action.|$|E

For another example, the panniculus carnosus in the echidna covers almost its entire body, enabling it to change its shape to a certain degree, most characteristically by rolling {{into a ball and}} presenting its spines to a potential predator.|$|E
