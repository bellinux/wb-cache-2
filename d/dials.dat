5|$|Norfolk {{is served}} {{by a variety of}} radio {{stations}} on the AM and FM <b>dials,</b> with towers located around the Hampton Roads area. These cater to many different interests, including news, talk radio, and sports, as well as an eclectic mix of musical interests.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two <b>dials,</b> one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the <b>dials</b> to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF <b>dialing</b> technology. Some manufacturers implemented pulse <b>dialing</b> with push-button keypads {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional <b>dial</b> pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the <b>dialed</b> number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid <b>dialing</b> for the user. Some push button pulse <b>dial</b> phones allow for double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b> These allow even faster pulse <b>dialing</b> in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>dial</b> of the Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing the <b>dial</b> mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's <b>dial</b> couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional <b>dial</b> phones, but instead has a button {{within each of the}} <b>dial's</b> number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the <b>dial</b> which stops the <b>dial</b> once it's turned to the <b>dial's</b> end position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{international}} <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8~10" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for}} a tone, and then <b>dial</b> '10', followed by the country code, area code and number. The long distance <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for a}} tone, and then <b>dial</b> the area code and number.|$|R

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were <b>dials</b> that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the <b>dials.</b> Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began {{developing}} {{more elaborate}} mechanized water clocks. The added complexity {{was aimed at}} regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and <b>dials.</b> Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E

50|$|International direct <b>dialing</b> (IDD) or {{international}} subscriber <b>dialling</b> (ISD) is placing an international telephone call that is <b>dialed</b> directly by a telephone subscriber, {{rather than by}} an telephone operator. The term international subscriber <b>dialling</b> {{was used in the}} United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to international direct <b>dialling.</b> Since the late 20th century, most international calls are <b>dialed</b> directly.|$|R

5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917â€“18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range <b>dials,</b> and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Newport University publishes its own newspaper, The Captain's Log. Hampton Roads Magazine {{serves as}} a {{bi-monthly}} regional magazine for Newport News and the Hampton Roads area.

5|$|Control room {{terminals}} {{will have}} new functionality including identification of all users and radio terminal positioning, radio and telephone inquiries {{made on the}} same equipment, use of either loudspeakers or head sets, and allowing operators to listen to each other's conversations. Operators have access to telephone books and speed <b>dials,</b> touch screen operations of voice and data traffic, monitoring of other talk groups, simultaneous calls to several talk groups and access to voice logs.|$|E
50|$|To <b>dial</b> {{from one}} {{dependent}} exchange {{to another one}} first <b>dialled</b> 9 to access the GSC then <b>dialled</b> the local code to the destination exchange. Thus a caller from Machen to Magor would <b>dial</b> 947 before the subscriber's number and a caller from Risca to Cwmbran would <b>dial</b> 93. A caller to a Newport number in the linked numbering scheme would simply <b>dial</b> 9.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>dialing</b> on landlines, calls made within {{cities are}} {{considered}} local calls {{and you just}} <b>dial</b> the local number. Calls to other cities (e.g. Karachi to Lahore) are considered long distance calls, e.g., when <b>dialing</b> to Lahore from Karachi you have to <b>dial</b> the code for Lahore then followed {{by the number of}} the destination, therefore you <b>dial</b> 042-XXXX-XXXX. For international calls, you <b>dial</b> [...] "00" [...] followed by the country code, e.g., for calls to the UK from Pakistan you <b>dial</b> 00 - 44 - XXXXXX.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll <b>dialling)</b> is a telephone system allowing subscribers to <b>dial</b> trunk calls without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be <b>dialled</b> directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be <b>dialled.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Covent Garden {{area has}} long been {{associated}} with entertainment and shopping. Covent Garden has 13 theatres, and over 60 pubs and bars, with most south of Long Acre, around the main shopping area of the old market. The Seven <b>Dials</b> area {{in the north of}} Covent Garden was home to the punk rock club The Roxy in 1977, and the area remains focused on young people with its trendy mid-market retail outlets.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller <b>dials</b> the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the <b>dials</b> on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital <b>dial</b> phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> tone and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then <b>dial</b> the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> tone, <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then <b>dial</b> 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R
50|$|The {{associated}} <b>dial</b> plan {{requires that}} all numbers, even for local calls, must be <b>dialed</b> with the assigned NDC, {{in contrast to}} previous plans. When <b>dialing</b> from within the country, a prefix 0 must be <b>dialed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Land line {{phone numbers}} in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.To <b>dial</b> a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number {{needs to be}} <b>dialled.</b> When <b>dialling</b> from a {{different}} Area/City, the telephone number is <b>dialled</b> in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When <b>dialling</b> from overseas, the 0 is omitted.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft <b>dials.</b> This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input <b>dials,</b> were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous <b>dials</b> and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> tone is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> tones are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
50|$|Direct {{distance}} <b>dialing</b> (DDD) is a {{telecommunication service}} feature {{in which a}} caller may, without operator assistance, call any other user outside the local calling area. Direct <b>dialing</b> by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be <b>dialed</b> as prefixes than for <b>dialing</b> within the local area or within an area code. DDD also extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} national public telephone network, in which case it is called international direct <b>dialing</b> or international direct distance <b>dialing</b> (IDDD).|$|R
50|$|A <b>dial</b> {{is said to}} be {{equiangular}} if its hour-lines {{are straight}} and spaced equally. Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include the equatorial <b>dial,</b> the equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, the cylindrical <b>dial</b> and the conical <b>dial.</b> However, other designs are equiangular, such as the Lambert <b>dial,</b> a version of the analemmatic <b>dial</b> with a moveable style.|$|R
