5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|Narayan uses a sarangi {{obtained}} from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings. He plays on foreign harp strings {{to produce a}} clearer tone. Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and {{found it easier to}} play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style open world city, {{similar to}} those seen in the Grand Theft Auto series. After trying this idea for six months, the team decided to scrap <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{interfered}} with the pacing and storytelling they intended to deliver in a thriller game.|$|E

5|$|Early {{use of the}} NS-10 among {{engineers}} include Bob Clearmountain, Rhett Davies, and Bill Scheniman in the US, and Nigel Jopson in the UK. Clearmountain, then {{a rising}} star in record production, is often credited for {{the popularity of the}} NS-10; Phil Ward, writing in Sound on Sound, suggested that Clearmountain was probably not the earliest, but was certainly the most influential early adopter. It became a legend that Clearmountain had chosen <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was the worst speaker he could find. He was one of a new breed of creative freelance recording engineers and producers who would travel from studio to studio equipped with their own gear that included microphones, and a pair of Yamaha NS-10, as a reference.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant {{head of a}} {{research}} team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} the turnpike in the Philadelphia area had become a {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was approved to widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and the turnpike commission members, and differences between the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on the widening began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The widening project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, the turnpike commission decided not to build <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Going {{against the}} normal {{convention}} that the strongest characters {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Ball most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku. Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up {{as a means to}} make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings. Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use. Since the completion of Dragon Ball, Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
