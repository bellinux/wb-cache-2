25|$|The loss {{of almost}} all of their land {{was not the only}} <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Havasupai were contending with: the {{increase}} in the number of settlers in the local region had depleted game used for hunting, and soil erosion (a result of poor irrigation techniques) touched off a series of food shortages. Furthermore, interaction with the settlers sparked deadly disease outbreaks amongst tribe members, who were ravaged by smallpox, influenza, and measles. By 1906 only 166 tribal members remainedhalf the number Garces saw when he first came across the tribe in 1776.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} East London Line closure, no replacement bus service was provided across the River Thames through the Rotherhithe Tunnel. London Transport {{was concerned that}} demand would be so high and buses would be so small that the frequency could have to be one bus every 30 seconds. There was also an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rotherhithe Tunnel is restricted to vehicles with a width no more than , which had been employed on previous occasions. However, by 2007 no such vehicles were commercially available that were low-floor compliant: the only ones with this width, as previously used, were minibuses with higher floors. As bus policy by this time was 100% low floor, it meant that no such service could be provided.|$|E

25|$|The second <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Philippine {{educational}} system faces is {{the budget for}} education. Although it has been mandated by the Philippine Constitution {{for the government to}} allocate the highest proportion of its government to education, the Philippines remains to have one of the lowest budget allocations to education among ASEAN countries. The third prevalent issue the Philippine {{educational system}} continuously encounters is the affordability of education (or lack thereof). A big disparity in educational achievements is evident across various social groups. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students otherwise known as students who are members of high and low-income poverty-stricken families have immensely higher drop-out rates in the elementary level. Additionally, most freshmen students at the tertiary level come from relatively well-off families. Lastly, there is a large proportion of mismatch, wherein there exists a massive proportion of mismatch between training and actual jobs. This stands to be a major issue at the tertiary level and it is furthermore the cause of the continuation of a substantial amount of educated yet unemployed or underemployed people.|$|E
25|$|The global American and European weather models {{encountered}} exceptional {{difficulty in}} portraying {{the path of}} the storm. The main <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> models were trying to resolve was whether or not the upper-level low pressure system from Central Canada was going to phase in time with the southern stream energy, thereby revealing if the resulting storm would come up the Eastern Seaboard or simply continue to move east out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The latter solution would have only caused the storm to affect the Mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina with a modest winter storm instead of the entire Eastern coastline up to Atlantic Canada. As such, it was only 24 hours prior to the storm's arrival in the Northeastern states when all the European and American models were in agreement that the storm would turn up the entire coastline. The National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center and many other private forecasters were skeptical of the storm impacting the Northeastern states until about 24 hours of the storm's arrival as well; although, some models depicted the storm delivering a full-blown blizzard to the New York City metropolitan area as early as a week in advance. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center even issued a statement on Christmas Eve, 48 hours prior to the storm, that they suspected the American models of having model initialization errors; thus, they believed these errors may have forced the storm to be erroneously modeled to come up the Northeastern coast.|$|E

500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake.

The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene.

[...] Finally, he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent {{with the intent of}} the Major Crimes Act. [...] In effect, he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the American public and on its own merits. [...] Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who, when making treaties to cede land, reserved certain rights to themselves. [...] He did not raise the <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribes already did have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person.|$|E

Levi Buchanan of IGN considered Super Mario Bros. 3s appearance in the film as a show-stealing element and referred to the movie as a [...] "90-minute commercial" [...] for the game. By 1993, the game had sold 4 and 7million unbundled units in Japan and the United States respectively. In the United States alone, the game generated over US$500million in revenue for Nintendo. Author David Sheff commented that, in music industry terms, the game went platinum 11 times. Including bundled units, the NES version of the game sold over 17 million copies. Game Informer reported in their October 2009 <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Virtual Console version had sold one million copies.

500|$|Itchy and Scratchy {{cartoons}} {{are often}} added when a show needs expanding or {{when there is}} an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writers wish to satirize.

The shorts are often difficult for the writers, and take much time to develop and devise a title, and in the end they fill little time. Writing the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons is quite often a group effort, with it being pitched out one gag after another. Itchy & Scratchy are a favorite of John Swartzwelder, who has written many of the episodes that center on them and quite often pitches the ideas for the shorts. In the early seasons, fans wanted more Itchy & Scratchy, so the writers decided to do [...] "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge," [...] an episode also dealt with censorship issues which would allow them to show several cartoons.
