25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to a stop, and was then shot at the scene of the crash. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E

Telford United had a bid of £1,500 {{and a small}} {{additional}} payment for Smith rejected in January 2008, which Worcester manager Richard Dryden labelled as [...] "derisory". A.F.C. Telford made a second bid, and <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successful, Smith would have become the club's record signing, as the eventual payment would have exceeded the £5,000 paid for Lee Moore in 2006. Worcester rejected A.F.C. Telford's second bid of £5,000, which would have potentially risen to a figure believed to be around £7,000 based on appearances, on 31 January 2008. He received his 10th yellow card of the season during a 1–0 defeat away to Stalybridge on 22 March 2008, resulting in a two-match suspension. His return came in a 6–0 defeat away to Blyth Spartans on 12 April 2008, before playing in the second leg of the Worcestershire Senior Cup final against Redditch, which Worcester lost 2–0 on the day and 2–1 on aggregate. The 2007–08 season, which Smith said was the worst of his career to date due to the injuries suffered throughout, saw him make 34 appearances and score three goals.|$|E
500|$|The Analecta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum {{claims that}} he was [...] "a Scot by birth", {{and that he was}} {{admitted}} into the Dominican Order of Paris in 1219. The latter source, however, is often highly unreliable, and cannot be fully trusted. The historian Archie Duncan was cautious about a date as firm and early as 1221, and wrote that Clement [...] "had entered the Dominican order by the later 1220s". Although [...] "Clement" [...] is neither a Scottish nor an English name, the large number of French-speakers in both Scotland and England during this period means that this consideration carries limited weight; indeed [...] "Clement" [...] need not even have been his birth-name. The diocese of Dunblane was entirely Gaelic-speaking in Clement's day, and in this era it was often frowned upon for a bishop to be ignorant of the language of his diocese. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a consideration in Clement's later appointment, then this would strongly suggest that Clement was in fact a Scot. It is worth adding that Clement was later noted for his skill in languages. Clement received his university education at either the University of Oxford or the University of Paris, perhaps at both of these institutions. There is a possibility that he can be identified more fully as [...] "Clement Rocha". A [...] "Father Clement Rocha" [...] was the owner of a manuscript from the period now held in Edinburgh.

Much of the viaduct's stone quality and some workmanship at the west end were only just adequate for the purpose ... but the flat-stone, lime-mortar-bedded, pier hearting carried up to 1.5m above arch springing was an effective feature which had probably saved the piers from collapse. In cross-section, the spandrels presented an unusual application of the classic gravity retaining wall.|$|E
2500|$|In summer 1875, Blavatsky {{began work}} on a book {{outlining}} her Theosophical worldview, much {{of which would be}} written while staying in the Ithaca home of Hiram Corson, a Professor of English Literature at Cornell University. Although she had hoped to call it The Veil of Isis, it would be published as Isis Unveiled. While writing it, Blavatsky claimed to be aware of a second consciousness within her body, referring to it as [...] "the lodger who is in me", and stating that it was this second consciousness that inspired much of the writing. In Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky quoted extensively from other esoteric and religious texts, although her contemporary and colleague Olcott always maintained that she had quoted from books that she did not have access to. Writing more than a century after her death Lachman conjectured that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the case, then she may have had an eidetic memory, such that, while relying on earlier sources, the book represented an original synthesis that connected disparate ideas not brought together before.|$|E
2500|$|Specific archaeological {{findings}} {{have confirmed that}} pets were mummified. The most famous {{example of this is}} the Theban Queen Makare’s adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops). [...] When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child. This puzzled archaeologists because Queen Makare was a High Priestess who had taken a serious vow of celibacy. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her child, it would have meant that she had, at some point, broken the oath she had taken as High Priestess, raising a slew of other questions regarding her life. Finally, in 1968, an x-ray was done on the small mummy, and it was determined to be an adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), not a child. Similarly, Makare’s half sister, Esemkhet, was discovered buried with a mummified pet—she had a mummified gazelle in her tomb. Prince Tuthmosis of the Dynasty XVIII was also buried with a beloved animal—his pet cat was mummified and placed in a stone coffin in his tomb. Another Egyptian, named Hapymen, had his pet dog mummified, wrapped in cloth, and placed at the side of his coffin. At the tomb KV 50 in the Valley of Kings, a mummified dog and baboon were discovered buried together, though the owner is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{plan was}} for an advance of [...] {{to reach the}} final {{objective}} which had been set for the attacks of [...] during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The ground to be taken was {{on the east side}} of Bazentin ridge, which ran north-west from the Somme to a hollow facing north-east with Combles at the west end, the hollow running towards Rocquigny beyond the Péronne–Bapaume road. North of the hollow lay Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, then the Albert–Bapaume road, west of Le Sars to Thiepval. Spurs ran down the eastern slope, generally to the north-east in the direction of the Péronne–Bapaume road, before the ground rose again from St Pierre Vaast Wood to Sailly-Saillisel, Le Transloy, Beaulencourt and Thilloy.
