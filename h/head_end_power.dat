5|$|For {{passenger}} {{service the}} F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500kW {{on the first}} order, 800kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover; from the head end to the train must be a constant frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small diesel engine {{at the rear of}} the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way; they can be identified by the diesel exhaust {{at the rear of the}} locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.|$|E

AC traction systems, prime movers, <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> equipment, and computer systems are supplied by GE, while MPI supplies the brake systems, air systems, and cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|When the Milwaukee Road {{purchased}} new Budd Company {{stainless steel}} bilevel cars in 1961, the Rock Island elected {{to add to}} a subsequent order and took delivery of its first bilevel equipment in 1964. Power for these new cars was provided by orphaned passenger units: three EMD F7s, an EMD E6, and the two EMD AB6s. The power was rebuilt with <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> to provide heat, air conditioning, and lighting for the new cars. In 1970, another order, this time for Pullman-built bilevel cars arrived to further supplement the fleet. To provide the power for these cars, several former Union Pacific EMD E8 and EMD E9 diesels were rebuilt with <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> and added to the commuter pool.|$|E
50|$|A cable {{television}} headend {{is a master}} facility for receiving television signals for processing and distribution over a {{cable television}} system. The headend facility is normally unstaffed and surrounded by some type of security fencing and is typically a building or large shed housing electronic equipment used to receive and re-transmit video over the local cable infrastructure. One can also find <b>head</b> <b>ends</b> in <b>power</b> line communication (PLC) substations and Internet communications networks.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} heavy haul train {{experiences}} of two large coal haulage operators: COALlink, Spoornet, South Africa and QR, Australia. Both rail systems have developed different train designs {{to meet their}} specific haulage needs. The reasons for these differences are examined {{using a combination of}} simulated and measured data. The first part of the investigation is focused on existing train systems. The trains compared are the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>powered</b> COALlink train of 21, 500 gross tonnes and the distributed power Coal and Mainline Freigt train of 7900 gross tonnes. The advantaes of distributed power are explored for the 21, 500 tonne COALlink train using the configuration of two equal wagon rates. The paper also explores by simulation the scope for each system to operate even larger trains, COALlink extending to 32, 300 gross tonnes and Coal and Mainline Freight to 18, 500 tonnes. To enable some method of normalised comparison using simulation the experimental technique of applying the same set of driving rules to each simulation was used. This allowed simulations to be completed over the full length of the haulage system. This technique imediately highlights the differences and similarities of the two systems. The simulation results confirmed the need for higher power-mass rations in QR trains and illustrate the in-train force reduction benefits of distributed power...|$|R

25|$|The A class rebuild {{contract}} was let in January 1983 to Clyde Engineering in Rosewater, South Australia. The first entered service in May 1984, but {{the project was}} abandoned in mid 1985 after rising costs due to structural fatigue. The 11th rebuild was delivered in August 1985. The N class were a new-build locomotive, mechanically similar to the A class. The major difference was the addition of <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> units, as it was believed this was a more efficient way of supplying power for air-conditioning and lighting than power vans or axle driven generator sets under carriages.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} {{frame and body}} locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division technology in the prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall.

2500|$|Chicago and North Western also {{operated}} {{commuter train}} {{service in the}} Chicago area, where they developed what was perhaps the first control car. [...] A modified gallery car was built in 1960 with locomotive controls to allow push-pull operation. [...] Today, it is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. The C also pioneered the concept of <b>Head</b> <b>End</b> <b>Power</b> (HEP), generating 480 volt electricity from the locomotive to power the air conditioning, lighting, and heating on the new bi-level cars. This eventually became the standard for all railroads in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) {{solicited}} {{proposals to}} develop high speed locomotives for routes outside the Northeast Corridor where electrification was not economical. [...] Bombardier Ltd, at the Plattsburg, N.Y. plant where the Acela was produced, developed a prototype (JetTrain) which combined a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW100 gas turbine and a diesel engine {{with a single}} gearbox powering four traction motors identical to those in Acela. [...] The diesel [...] provided <b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power</b> and low speed traction, with the turbine not being started until after leaving stations. [...] The prototype was completed in June 2000, and safety testing was done at the FRA's Pueblo, CO test track beginning {{in the summer of}} 2001. A maximum speed of [...] was reached.

2500|$|The FAs, as well {{as their}} cousins, the ALCO PAs, were born as a result of Alco's {{development}} of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244. [...] In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests. [...] This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of Alco's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946. [...] In preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first four locomotives with the 244 engines had been built. Two FA-1s and an FB-1 were painted in Alco Demonstrator colors and were released for road tests for {{a month and a half}} on the Delaware and Hudson Railway. A strike at Alco delayed production beyond the first four units and delivery of the first three ex-demonstrator units, to the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad, began in mid February 1946. The remainder of the order began delivery in May 1946 and continued until April 1947 for a total of 80 units. [...] Before the end of this production run, Alco upgraded the generators and traction motors in the locomotives, with the first of these models entering service in February 1947 for the New York Central. [...] In 1950, the Montreal Locomotive Works, an affiliate of Alco, began production of FAs as well. [...] In the Fall of 1950, an upgraded model, the FA-2, was launched. [...] This model featured an uprated Model 244 engine, with an output of 1600 horsepower. [...] Additionally, the carbody was lengthened, making possible the addition of a steam generator in the A unit to allow for use in passenger service. [...] Models equipped as such were designated the FPA-2/FPB-2. [...] The first FA-2s were delivered in October 1950 to the Baltimore and Ohio and the Erie. [...] By this time, however, the cab unit had fallen out of favor due to the greater versatility of road switchers, and U S production of the FA line ended in 1956, with Canadian production ending in 1959. The MTA Long Island Rail Road purchased 20 units and removed the traction motors from the units. the LIRR used them to supply AC HEP (<b>head</b> <b>end</b> <b>power)</b> to the cars of the train. Also the engines were used as a cab when another engine was pushing on the east end of the train. By the late 1990s and early 2000s the railroad began retiring the Alcos for new double deck cab cars.|$|E
