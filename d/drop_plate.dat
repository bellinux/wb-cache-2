The objective {{of this research was}} to compare the accuracy and fidelity of <b>drop</b> <b>plate</b> method vs. spread plate method by parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. For bacterial enumeration by drop and spread plate methods, successive dilutions of second subculture of Lactobacillus casei and Salmonella Typhimurium were transferred to selective agar. The correlation of agreement between both methods was evaluated by using statistical proofs. Results showed that mean value (parametric unpaired t-test) comparison at 95 percent confidence level did not reject null hypothesis, which it meant that the equality of the mean data could not be ruled out. Nonparametric method was used because of approximately Gaussian pattern of data distribution. For this purpose, Mann-Whitney test (equivalent nonparametric t- test) was used. It meant that the equality of medians obtained from two methods were similar. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient (r) via both methods due to data distribution patterns for enumeration of S. Typhimurium and L. casei were 0. 62 and 0. 87, respectively; which represented moderately strong and strong relationship between two methods, respectively. Besides, there was a significant and strong positive correlation (p < 0. 001) between spread and <b>drop</b> <b>plate</b> procedures.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Listeria monocytogenes is {{considered}} as a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen {{which can lead to}} serious infections, especially in newborns, elderly, pregnant, and immunocompromised people. The organism has been isolated from many foods and may cause meningitis, septicemia and abortion in pregnant women. Also L. monocytogenes forms biofilms on many food contact surface materials and medical devices. Development of biofilms on many surfaces is a potential source of contamination of foods that may lead to spoilage or transmission of foodborne pathogens. Materials & Methods: Biofilm formation of L. monocytogenes (RITCC 1293 serotype 4 a) was investigated. Hydrophobicity of L. monocytogenes was measured by MATH method.

In this study, three different methods were used to investigate aerial biodiversity over Svalbard: impaction, membrane filtration and <b>drop</b> <b>plates.</b> Sites around Svalbard were selected due to their relatively remote location, low human population, geographical location with respect to air movement and the tradition and history of scientific investigation on the archipelago, ensuring the presence of existing research infrastructure.

Twelve different phyla were detected in the air collected above Svalbard, although the diversity was considerably lower than in urban environments elsewhere. However, only 58 of 196 bacterial genera detected were consistently present, suggesting potentially higher levels of heterogeneity.
