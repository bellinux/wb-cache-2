Recently, there has been increased pressure for <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> to be more environmentally and socially responsible. A project creates a dynamic context for stakeholder management and stakeholder behavior because the project moves through different phases during its lifecycle. By adopting a lifecycle perspective on secondary stakeholders' behavior, we develop a set of propositions that increase {{our understanding of the}} potential of secondary stakeholders to influence the project management's decision making during the different phases of the project lifecycle. Ultimately, a better understanding of secondary stakeholders' influence behavior during the project lifecycle enables the use of more effective project stakeholder management approaches.

The ability of managing <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> is becoming an indispensable part of the companies’ competency portfolio {{in order to survive}} in the fierce competition. This research aims to provide an efficient and lean methodology for companies that want to be efficient at managing <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> This paper contributes to the project management literature by expanding the knowledge on pulse methodology with a new methodology called digital pulse methodology, which helps companies to manage their <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> Pulse methodology is a well-known and widely used methodology in Sweden for managing deviations in product development. Companies appreciate its simplicity and its lean tools. However, previous studies show that it is not efficient in <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> {{and there are a number}} of requirements it must fulfill in order to do so. We developed digital pulse methodology as an expansion on baseline pulse methodology aiming to improve the appreciated methodology towards making it fulfill the given requirements, thus help companies to manage deviations in <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> We tested the new methodology by making the case company use it over a three months period. We gathered the results of the requirement tests along with the other benefits of the methodology using observations and interviews...|$|R

40|$|The knowledge-based-view of {{the firm}} {{identifies}} knowledge as a resource with {{at least as much}} importance as capital (Grant 1996). Many have argued that a key asset for global firms is the knowledge they are able to gain from the diversity of environments in which they operate (Bartlett 1987; Ghoshal 1987). However, previous research has also identified the additional challenges that global firms and <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> encounter. These projects frequently bring together diverse participants in an unfamiliar environment. In these situations, firms are exposed to different "institutions " (regulations, norms and cultural beliefs) that can increase project costs and durations and damage reputations and relations (Orr 2005; Orr and Scott 2008). Recognizing that challenges exist for firms who operate globally due to these differences, we are conducting exploratory research on the types of knowledge that global real estate developers, contractors and engineers feel are important for <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> and how they are able to mobilize this knowledge for their <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> In future work we plan to elaborate and expand this research to account further for knowledge type, firm type and project phase.

Our study was carried out within a multinational pharmaceutical company, which following a merger reorganized its IT organization into global organisation. Members of the Swedish part of its IT organization reported severe problems after the reorganization, and called for an investigation. The reported problems were <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> struggling with cultural differences and, as a consequence, overconsuming their allotted resources. However, previous research regarding merged organizations has found, that complaints about cultural differences might be a mask for other problems. Our findings do include cultural differences being an obstacle to project performance. However, we identified project complexity and geographical distance as two additional, important factors explaining frustration and low performance in the <b>global,</b> dispersed <b>projects.</b> Thus, our study supports the earlier theory that practitioners overload the concept cultural differences, ignoring that <b>global</b> <b>projects</b> typically involve more stakeholders, and that it is more challenging to create the trust among the dispersed team members necessary to create a high-performing team. <b>Global</b> <b>projects</b> can be expected to reach a climate of high-performing team later than a local project, leaving its members to performing less during a longer time. Consequently, and putting other advantages aside, if management fail to develop a successful global team strategy, such projects can be expected to be more costly to the company, and more frustrating to team members being used to quickly reaching a high-performing state. Such a strategy would need to include ways of motivating project members to actively build trustful relations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProblem solving is an {{important}} part of product development. Efficient deviation management together with efficient synchronization can increase the problem solving capabilities of companies. In this paper, we present a deviation management methodology called pulse methodology, which is widely used for product development management in Sweden. It is based on identifying deviations with traffic-coded magnets on a whiteboard and synchronizing the company with frequent meetings. We describe both the baseline pulse methodology and a specific adaptation case of it in a Swedish product development company where this research was carried out. Results showed that pulse methodology manages deviations in local projects efficiently and brings further benefits to the company. The aim of this research is to make the case company more efficient at managing deviations in global projects; specifically help them use pulse methodology for also <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> In order to do so, we proposed improvements on pulse methodology to make it feasible to be used for <b>global</b> <b>projects.</b> The results have implications to all companies that use or want to use pulse methodology for managing deviations in <b>global</b> <b>projects...</b>|$|R
