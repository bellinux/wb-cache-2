40|$|This paper {{describes}} the implementation {{and testing of}} a fuel cell system for powering the on-board electrical load of a pick-up truck that is being converted to a hydrogen-internal combustion engine. The fuel cell is assisted by a supercapacitor bank during <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> which requires a much larger current. The sizing of the system components is determined from actual current demand of various loads. This new power source will replace the 12 Volt battery and alternator found in the conventional vehicle. Laboratory tests including supercapacitor charging, <b>engine</b> <b>starting,</b> and load <b>switching</b> are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated switch mounted on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the <b>engine</b> <b>starts,</b> the key-operated <b>switch</b> is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|R
50|$|The solenoid also closes high-current {{contacts}} for {{the starter}} motor, which begins to turn. Once the <b>engine</b> <b>starts,</b> the key-operated <b>switch</b> is opened, a {{spring in the}} solenoid assembly pulls the pinion gear away from the ring gear, and the starter motor stops. The starter's pinion is clutched to its drive shaft through an overrunning sprag clutch which permits the pinion to transmit drive in only one direction. In this manner, drive is transmitted through the pinion to the flywheel ring gear, but if the pinion remains engaged (as for example because the operator fails to release the key {{as soon as the}} <b>engine</b> <b>starts,</b> or if there is a short and the solenoid remains engaged), the pinion will spin independently of its drive shaft. This prevents the engine driving the starter, for such backdrive would cause the starter to spin so fast as to fly apart.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} {{typically}} activated by a key and a <b>starting</b> motor <b>switch.</b> Upon turning {{the key and}} pressing the <b>starting</b> motor <b>switch,</b> the oil pressure alarm will ring for about a second until the <b>engine</b> <b>starts</b> to run. The exit of cooling water from the exhaust into the sea (typically at the aft of the boat) should be checked at that time. After a few minutes, the hot cooling water alarm will sound if the cooling water does not get through the engine (as when the seawater cock has remained closed -most likely case- or if something is clogging the seawater tubing).|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} four seats on the {{lifeboat}} but the boat is capable of carrying over twenty people if necessary. At the heart of the lifeboat there is a console which houses the helmsman’s controls. This console also houses the illuminated compass, depth sounder, and various switches for controlling navigation lights. The <b>engine</b> <b>start</b> and stop <b>switching</b> is also located there along with individual tachometers motor high temperature warning lights. Behind the console is the seating for the crew, with the helmsman at the front, radio operator behind him to the port side, navigator to starboard and the fourth man's seat behind them. To secure the crew, each seat has foot straps fitted to the deck. The lifeboats water-tight VHF radio, loudspeaker system and hand-held microphone is located on the portside just behind the helmsmen position, although this can all be operated by a built-in radio speaker in the helmsman’s helmet. The lifeboat also has a Global Positioning System and radar control to a display screen. The system provides the lifeboat crew with co-ordinates, estimated speed, and guidance to programmable waypoints. The Oddfellows also has DF radio which will indicate the compass heading that a radio contact is coming from.|$|R
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, driven sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the <b>engine</b> is <b>started</b> with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after <b>engine</b> <b>start,</b> the clutch <b>switch</b> located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R

50|$|Improvements to the Rambler {{included}} a full-width die-cast grille while the body side gained an uninterrupted line. Rather than blending into the C-pillar, the belt line continued to the tailfins. Engineering changes included thicker brake linings and larger brakes for V8-powered cars, {{as well as}} fuel economy improvements with lower axle ratios and more efficient carburetor for the I6 engines. An electrically engaged overdrive unit behind the three-speed manual transmission was also available. The automatic transmission was operated by pushbuttons on the left-side of the instrument panel. To increase longevity, Rambler mufflers were aluminum-coated {{on the inside and}} zinc-coated on the outside. On cars with automatic transmission, <b>engine</b> <b>starting</b> was now incorporated into the neutral pushbutton, thus eliminating the ignition key <b>start</b> <b>switch.</b> Accidental starter engagement was prevented by a lockout when the engine was running.|$|R
