5|$|On 29 April 1938, Pattle {{accompanied}} the unit to Egypt having been tasked with the defence of the Suez Canal. While in Egypt, Pattle carried out ground attack duties against Arab rebels. He fired on the enemy several times as local rebellions against British rule took shape and then <b>died</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented {{a new and more}} complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a {{link with}} the Itchen. A meeting was held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, but although most of this soon <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports Junction Canal. Two routes were surveyed by different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{increasingly}} devoted {{her efforts}} to the administration of Normandy, rather than the war in England. Geoffrey sent the Bishop of Thérouanne to Rome in 1148 to campaign for Henry's right to the English throne, and opinion within the English Church gradually shifted in Henry's favour. Matilda and Geoffrey made peace with Louis VII, who in return supported Henry's rights to Normandy. Geoffrey died unexpectedly in 1151, and Henry claimed the family lands. Henry returned to England once again {{at the start of}} 1153 with a small army, winning the support of some of the major regional barons. Neither side's army was keen to fight, however, and the Church brokered a truce; a permanent peace followed, under which Henry recognised Stephen as king, but became Stephen's adopted son and successor. Meanwhile, Normandy faced considerable disorder and the threat of baronial revolt, which Matilda was unable to totally suppress. Stephen died the next year, and Henry assumed the throne; his coronation used the grander of the two imperial crowns that Matilda had brought back from Germany in 1125. Once Henry had been crowned, the troubles facing Matilda in Normandy <b>died</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{decorative}} {{drawings of}} heraldic dolphins and sea monsters were frequently used to illustrate maps, {{such as the}} Carta marina.

Nevertheless, stories of sea monsters and eyewitness accounts which claim to have seen these beasts persist to this day.|$|E
25|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 7February, residents had anticipated that the fire front would bypass Marysville. At about 5:00pm, power was lost to the town.

25|$|Looking {{over to the}} east, at 03:50, those aboard these LCAs {{could see}} the gunfire and flares that marked the {{collision}} of the Yellow Beach flotillas with the German convoy. Once the fire of the engagement far off to port <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> navigation was aided again by the spectacle of red and green navigation lights shining steadily on Dieppe's harbour entrance.|$|E
25|$|Sound {{was also}} used to express ideas of paradise. The {{interior}} of the mausoleum has a reverberation time (the time taken from when a noise is made until all of its echoes have <b>died</b> <b>away)</b> of 28 seconds. This provided an atmosphere where the words of those employed to continually recite the Qu'ran (the Hafiz), in tribute and prayer {{for the soul of}} Mumtaz, would linger in the air.|$|E

He <b>died</b> <b>away</b> from his family and away from the only place that he considered as his fatherland, Paraguay, and without a single mention in the country from where he escaped: Spain.|$|E

25|$|The second, and final, {{phase of}} the German plan was Fall Rot. The Luftwaffe {{supported}} the rapidly advancing army into southern France by initiating several offensives such as Operation Paula. Opposition in the air, significant at first, <b>died</b> <b>away.</b> The Armée de l'air was now largely absent from French skies. Nearly 1,000 of its aircraft were destroyed and captured on airfields around Paris {{after the fall of}} the city on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|The trial lasted nine days, {{and in the}} end {{the jury}} threw out Norton's claim, siding with Lord Melbourne. However, the {{resulting}} publicity almost brought down the government. The scandal eventually <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> but not before Caroline's reputation was ruined and her friendship with Lord Melbourne destroyed. Norton continued to prevent Caroline from seeing her three sons, and blocked her from receiving a divorce. According to English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father, and there was little Caroline could do to regain custody.|$|E
25|$|Stewart Downing {{was once}} again linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur {{at the start of}} the window.

It was confirmed on 28 January that Woodgate had signed for Tottenham for an undisclosed fee.|$|E

5000|$|... “Vergänglichkeit” (Transience)- Poem by Herman Hesse. The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the soprano and strings. The orchestra and chorus build to a climactic middle section and quickly fade. The movement builds heavily again {{towards the end}} of the movement only to quickly <b>die</b> <b>away</b> once again. This building up and <b>dying</b> <b>away</b> is reflected in the text, which reflects on how the thriving can quickly expire due to the rigors of the world.|$|R

25|$|Tension {{between the}} teams bubbled {{beneath the surface}} {{throughout}} the tour. In the third test, Aaqib Javed was warned by the umpires for intimidatory bowling at Devon Malcolm, which riled up the Pakistan team. Accusations of ball tampering to produce their reverse swing were levied at Wasim and Waqar through the British press, after they were reported to the ICC Match Referee after a One-day International at Lord's. The accusations led to a high-level inquiry, but ultimately no players had action taken against them and the furore eventually <b>died</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Lawrence surrendered, firing <b>died</b> <b>away</b> briefly. Detroit {{collided}} with Queen Charlotte, both ships being almost unmanageable with damaged rigging {{and almost every}} officer killed or severely wounded. Barclay was severely wounded and his first lieutenant was killed, leaving Lieutenant Inglis in command. Most of the smaller British vessels were also disabled and drifting to leeward. The British nevertheless expected Niagara to lead the American schooners away in retreat. Instead, once aboard Niagara, Perry dispatched Elliot to bring the schooners into closer action, while he steered Niagara at Barclay's damaged ships, helped by the strengthening wind.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E

25|$|After his retirement, on October 26, 1856, which Halbertsma {{applied for}} himself because {{his heart was}} not in his duties as a {{minister}} anymore, he withdrew into his upstairs apartment, where {{from that point on}} he became increasingly more lonely as his family members and friends <b>died</b> <b>away,</b> although his foreign contacts through correspondence remained intact. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma died in Deventer on February 27, 1869, when he was 79 years of age. By that time he had been a widower for 22 years. He was survived by his sons Watse and Tsjalling. In 1947, the Dr. Joast Halbertsma Award, the highest provincial decoration in the field of historical (and later more general scientific) research concerning the province of Friesland was named in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Adrien Dubois was {{the second}} {{youngest}} brother of the 10 brothers. He was in general considered the strong man {{in the drug trade}} along with his brother Claude, although he was considered more low profile than some of his other brothers he was perceived as the smarter and more discreet operator, unlike some of his brothers who were the flexing type. After Adrien was charged and acquitted in a highly publicized case in 1983 he stayed generally clear of the spotlight and criminal charges. In his final years of his life he lived in a cottage north of Montreal in Saint Adele and presided over a company, which was registered as a real-estate firm. His family stated in his obituary that he had <b>died</b> <b>away</b> at the age of 68 and stated no cause of death although there was a request that any donations go to the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1857, at {{an early}} stage in the Indian Mutiny, Lord Palmerston offered Campbell the command of all British forces in India. Promoted to the local rank of full general in India the same day, he left England the next day and reached Calcutta in August 1857. He {{relieved}} and then evacuated Lucknow in November 1857 and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tantia Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore in December 1857, he captured Lucknow again in March 1858. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 14 May 1858 and raised to the peerage as Baron Clyde, of Clydesdale in Scotland on 3 August 1858. In Autumn 1858, faced with a further mutiny by the East India Company's European troops, who had not received their enlistment bounties, he used British troops to enforce discipline until the British Cabinet agreed some concessions. He continued in charge of the operations in India until all aspects of the revolt had <b>died</b> <b>away</b> and then returned to England in June 1860.|$|E
