Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know.

He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent. By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth's acting, [...] "He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius." [...] The Philadelphia Press drama critic said, [...] "Without having [...] Edwin's culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> more natural genius." ...|$|E
500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. [...] Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, [...] "the two men bonded almost immediately." [...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I am here to learn, not to teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1952 Hershey–Chase experiment, geneticists were more {{inclined}} to consider DNA as the genetic material, and Alfred Hershey was an influential member of the phage group. [...] Erwin Chargaff had shown that the base composition of DNA varies by species (contrary to the tetranucleotide hypothesis), and in 1952 Rollin Hotchkiss published his experimental evidence both confirming Chargaff's work and demonstrating the absence of protein in Avery's transforming principle. Furthermore, the field of bacterial genetics was quickly becoming established, and biologists were more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of heredity in the same terms for bacteria and higher organisms. [...] After Hershey and Chase used radioactive isotopes to show that it was primarily DNA, rather than protein, that entered bacteria upon infection with bacteriophage, it was soon widely accepted that DNA was the material. [...] Despite the much less precise experimental results (they found a not-insignificant amount of protein entering the cells as well as DNA), the Hershey–Chase experiment was not subject to the same degree of challenge. Its influence was boosted by the growing network of the phage group and, the following year, by the publicity surrounding the DNA structure proposed by Watson and Crick [...] (Watson was {{also a member of the}} phage group). [...] Only in retrospect, however, did either experiment definitively prove that DNA is the genetic material.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{position}} as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that [...] "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that it would be}} granted". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for [...] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he [...] "should have no difficulty" [...] as long as he [...] "presented them to some public body" [...] such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the [...] "largest & most central collection", not the [...] Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.|$|E

500|$|On 22 August 1845, Governor Butterworth wrote {{again to}} the Government of India, {{indicating}} he trusted that construction of the lighthouse on Peak Rock would begin soon [...] "as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance". Between 1824 and 1851, at least 16 sizeable vessels were wrecked {{in the vicinity of}} Pedra Branca and Point Romania (on the Johor coast). However, in April 1846, the Lords of the Admiralty in London informed the Court of Directors of the East India Company they were <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Pedra Branca was the best point for the lighthouse. John Thomson and Captain S. Congalton, commander of the East India Company's steamer called the Hooghly, carried out surveys in May and August. In a report dated 25 August, they said they were [...] "decidedly of opinion that Pedra Branca is the only proper position for a Light to be placed ... for the safety of Shipping whether entering or departing for the Straits of Singapore ..." [...] The following day, Governor Butterworth wrote to the Government of India stating that the Government [...] "will at once perceive that Pedra Branca is the only true position" [...] for the lighthouse. On 30 October 1846 the President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca as the site for the lighthouse. The East India Company gave its approval on 24 February 1847, and on 10 May of that year the Government of India asked Governor Butterworth to take measures for the construction of the lighthouse. There {{is no evidence that the}} authorities in Singapore thought it necessary or desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent for its erection.|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Sara {{were in an}} open {{relationship}} {{encouraged by}} the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated {{to find a new}} partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that [...] "our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> as long as he got a result." [...] He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman {{for the rest of his}} life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his [...] "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, [...] "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" [...] while Hubbard [...] "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions." ...|$|E

He probably had either a surname to be concealed or else unpronounceable to French lips.

2500|$|Philosophical Investigations {{is unique}} in its {{approach}} to philosophy. [...] A typical philosophical text presents a philosophical problem, summarizes and critiques various alternative approaches to solving it, presents its own approach, and then argues in favour of that approach. In contrast, Wittgenstein's book treats philosophy as an activity, rather {{along the lines of}} Socrates's famous method of maieutics; he has the reader work through various problems, participating actively in the investigation. [...] Rather than presenting a philosophical problem and its solution, Wittgenstein engages in a dialogue, where he provides a thought experiment (a hypothetical example or situation), describes how one might be <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, and then shows why that inclination suffers from conceptual confusion. The following is an excerpt from the first entry in the book that exemplifies this method: ...|$|E

60|$|That Shakespeare never “turned {{his genius}} to stage-writing,” as Theobald most Theobaldice phrases it, {{before he became}} an actor, is an {{assertion}} of about as much authority as the precious story that he left Stratford for deer-stealing, and that he lived by holding gentlemen’s horses at {{the doors of the}} theatre, and other trash of that arch-gossip, old Aubrey. The metre is an argument against Titus Andronicus being Shakespeare’s, worth a score such chronological surmises. Yet I <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that both in this play and in Jeronymo, Shakespeare wrote some passages, and that they are the earliest of his compositions.|$|R
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before {{the first round of the}} 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy had an {{interview}} with philosopher Michel Onfray. Sarkozy stated that disorders such as paedophilia and depression have a genetic as well as social basis, saying [...] "... I'd be <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease"; he claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, [...] "I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide." [...] These statements were criticised by some scientists, including geneticist Axel Kahn. Sarkozy later added, [...] "What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let's debate it, let's not close the door to all debate." ...|$|E

[...] But some wealth is inherently fruitful, like a pair of breeding cattle, or a vat of grape juice soon to ferment into wine. Planes and other sorts of inert matter (and the most lent item of all – money itself) earn interest indirectly, by being part of the same [...] "circle of exchange" [...] with fruitful forms of wealth such as those, so that tying up these forms of wealth over time incurs an opportunity cost.|$|E

I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E
