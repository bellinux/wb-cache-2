5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by putting up a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also stepped up to the challenge and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{realizes that}} {{if no one}} cares {{about the lives of}} animals, then he is {{worthless}} to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks to think it over, and after talking it over with his best friend and {{neighbor}} Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility eventually leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from <b>his</b> <b>collar,</b> following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E

25|$|In January 1923, while {{preparing}} for spring training and recuperating from <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> and shoulder injuries, Heilmann took up handball and quickly {{developed a reputation}} as one of the best players in the country.

25|$|For the {{majority}} of his time in 1973, Tyler wears a black leather jacket with jeans or plain trousers and typical shoes of the day, with <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> spread out and no tie, unlike the rest of Hunt's CID. During his brief showing in 2006, he wears a formal dark navy suit with a tie. Tyler also wears a St. Christopher pendant, reflecting his time traveller status as St. Christopher is the patron saint of travellers.|$|E
25|$|In June 1864, Hooker was the {{adjutant-general}} for the First Brigade, Second Division, Eighteenth Army Corps, {{in charge}} of nine regiments during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Hooker received several serious wounds during the battle: he was shot five times, twice in the legs, twice in the body, once through the left shoulder, and one that shattered <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone, leaving the subclavian artery bare. Hooker, however, recovered and {{was assigned to the}} Third Division, Twenty-fourth Corps and served with the First Brigade. After the surrender of Richmond {{and the end of the}} war, Hooker tendered his resignation but was refused twice. Hooker was able to muster out with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1865.|$|E

25|$|In a warm up {{match against}} Durham before the 2010 season started, Keedy broke <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone. The injury left him unable {{to play for}} several months. In Keedy's absence, Lancashire's young spinners, Stephen Parry and Simon Kerrigan, were given {{opportunities}} in the first team. Kerrigan was chosen ahead of Parry in the four-day team and cemented {{his place in the}} side. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. Their partnership began with them competing to out perform each other. After a discussion the pair decided they would be more effective if they worked together to build pressure while bowling. Keedy finished the season with 31first-class wickets at an average of 22.19.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 1896 Bonifacio led {{an assault}} on San Mateo, Marikina and Montalban. The Spanish were forced to retreat, leaving these areas to the rebels, except for the {{municipal}} hall of San Mateo where some Spanish troops had barricaded. While Bonifacio's troops laid siege to the hall, other Katipunan forces set up defensive lines along the nearby Langka (or Nangka) river against Spanish reinforcements coming {{from the direction of}} Marikina. After three days, Spanish counterattacks broke through the Nangka river lines. The Spanish troops thus recaptured the rebel positions and surprised Bonifacio in San Mateo, who ordered a general retreat to Balara. They were pursued, and Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding Emilio Jacinto from a Spanish bullet which grazed <b>his</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
25|$|It also re-established Sakuraba's {{proficiency}} {{in dealing with}} larger opponents and placed him back in line for another shot at Wanderlei Silva in Pride's next event, this time to decide Pride's inaugural 205-pound champion. Usually prone to humorous entrances, it was a somber and focused Sakuraba that came down the aisle for his rematch with Silva. As with Jackson, Sakuraba was able to score an early takedown in the bout, where he then worked from Silva's guard. After several minutes searching for an opening, he finally found one when Silva attempted to escape to his feet. Sakuraba locked on a tight guillotine choke, but was countered by a slam from Wanderlei which ended up breaking <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone. Not willing {{to let him go}} on so hampered, his corner threw in the towel between rounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{confrontation}} between Konnan and Pierroth Jr. {{was just a}} preview for their match later that night, in the semi-final position of the show. The two faced off in a Dog collar match, which meant that the two were joined together by a long steel chain that was connected to a dog collar {{around the neck of}} each competitor. The collar was then locked to prevent one of the wrestlers from getting out of the collar during the match. At some point Pierroth Jr. either stole the key from the referee, or had a spare key hidden somewhere as he was able to take off <b>his</b> <b>collar,</b> use the freedom of movement to tie up Konnan and hit him repeatedly with the steel chain. With Konnan down Pierroth Jr. was able to touch the top turnbuckle on all four corners, which was how the match was won.|$|E
25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around <b>his</b> <b>collar,</b> the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
25|$|In early 1967 Porter turned {{professional}}, riding for the Condor Mackeson team. The {{step up to}} {{the professional}} ranks meant that in the individual pursuit he was now racing 5,000m instead of 4,000m, but in his first test at the distance, he emerged victorious, beating Dave Bonner to win the professional title in Leicester. Porter was then selected to race in the world professional pursuit event in Amsterdam. Porter qualified for the final, but, unsettled by a puncture to his opponent, Tiemen Groen, that forced a re-run, he was beaten by two seconds. Nonetheless, his silver medal led to contracts from track promoters, including an invitation to ride the London six-day race – his first. He crashed on the fourth day, breaking <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone, and missed contracts for other six-day races. However, he recovered and spent much of the winter track-racing in Belgium, finishing the Antwerp six-day before returning to England {{for the start of the}} 1968 road season.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} other {{countries}} have breed-specific legislation on the books. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) restricts the ownership of pit-bull type dogs and other breeds. In May 2010, a pit-bull type dog named Lennox was impounded from his disabled owner and deemed to be {{a danger to the}} public by authorities in Belfast, Northern Ireland, under the Dangerous Dogs (NI) Order 1991. The impoundment and subsequent court order to destroy Lennox sparked a two-year-long legal battle and heated public relations campaign over the fate of the dog that included an international letter-writing and social media campaign; a petition signed by more than 214,000 people worldwide; street protests in Belfast, London, and New York City; public appeals from celebrities like the boxer Lennox Lewis and the First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson; and threatening letters and acts of violence directed at some of Belfast's dog wardens. Dog trainer and international television celebrity Victoria Stilwell campaigned to save Lennox's life, appealing to the Belfast City Council and Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O'Neill to allow her to re-home Lennox in the United States, where several rescue organizations had offered him sanctuary. All appeals, including Stilwell's were ignored by Belfast City Councillors, and Lennox was euthanised on July 11, 2012. Belfast City Council declined to return Lennox's body, <b>his</b> <b>collar,</b> or his ashes to his family.|$|E
25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. The gesture of the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched out. There is a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E
25|$|Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, was {{released}} from prison during the 2006 college football season and was able to watch his son as a spectator {{for the first time on}} October 14, 2006, when Oklahoma played Iowa State. Oklahoma defeated Iowa State in that game; however, on the final drive for the Sooners, Peterson broke <b>his</b> <b>collar</b> bone when he dove into the end zone on a 53-yard touchdown run. During a press conference on October 18, Peterson said he was told by doctors to expect to be out for 4–6 weeks. At the time of the injury, Peterson needed only to gain 150yards to pass Billy Sims as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher. He was unable to return for the rest of the Sooners' regular season and missed seven games. The Sooners would turn to Allen Patrick, a junior, and Chris Brown, a freshman, to replace Peterson. The team went on a seven-game winning streak including winning the Big 12 Championship game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He returned for their last game against Boise State in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, where he rushed for 77yards and a touchdown. He refused to discuss his plans beyond the end of this season with the press. He concluded his college football career with 1,112 rushing yards his final season, even after missing multiple games due to injury for a total of 4,245 rushing yards (only three seasons). He finished 73yards short of passing Billy Sims as Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher.|$|E

She liked to do things for him: she liked to put a cup for his tea and to iron <b>his</b> <b>collars,</b> of which he was so proud. It was a joy to her to have him proud of <b>his</b> <b>collars.</b> There was no laundry. So she used to rub away at them with her little convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure of her arm. Now she would not do it for him. Now he was going away. She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart. He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself. That was the grief and the pain to her. He took nearly all himself away.|$|R
