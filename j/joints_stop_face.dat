40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviors}} of a two-link hopping robot with two stopper mechanisms are investigated theoretically. In the theoretical analysis, the dynamic {{behaviors of the}} two-link hopping robot with two stopper mechanisms are modeled by use of the four phases (phase-A, phase-B, phase-C, phase-D). At {{the moment when the}} first <b>joint</b> <b>stops,</b> the state of the system transfers from phase-A to phase-B. Then, at the moment when the second <b>joint</b> <b>stops,</b> the state of the system transfers from phase-B to phase-C. In phase-C, the two-link hopping robot moves in space, and at the moment when the two-link hopping robot lands, the state of the system transfers from phase-C to phase-D. Using the principle of the conservation of momentum and angular momentum, the initial states in the periods of phase-B and phase-C are derived, and the equations of motion of the two-link hopping robot in all phases are obtained. Furthermore, the numerical simulations have been carried out, and it is confirmed theoretically that the hopping and moving action can be performed successfully...|$|R

40|$|Recently, one {{attractive}} and challenging {{topic in the}} field of robotic manipulationis “hyper-dynamic manipulation”, which is defined as highly skillful manipulationwith high motion specifications, especially the kind of high-speed dynamicmanipulation such as in sport and is considered an extension of dynamic manipulation. It is hoped that the hyper-dynamic manipulation can be realized by robots, especiallyby a humanoid in the near future. However, conventional manipulators are designed with view of simplifying thedesign process by adopting fixed joint motion profiles and selecting actuators tosatisfy the torque and power needs of different joints resulting from the motion profile. In the case of serial manipulators, this method leads to a bad cycle of heavieractuators and heavier links in the mechanism and low efficiency dynamicmanipulation. Compared with the conventional manipulators, human beings display better skillin hyper-dynamic sports motion. This is due to the smart structure of the human body,in which the actuators near body are more powerful and heavier than those near theend of arm, and the power can be transferred from the body to the end of arm duringhyper-dynamic manipulation. This kind of power transfer is due to the utilization ofcoupling and is called dynamically coupled driving. Moreover, in dynamicmanipulation, human beings can utilize their <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> efficiently to improve andstrengthen the effect of dynamically coupled driving. This is a big difference fromconventional robots in which any collision between links and <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> should beavoided. Inspired by the merits of the human body’s structure and the motion control skill,this research aims to realize hyper-dynamic manipulation with a smart and versatilerobot using unique mechanism design and control. At first, the basic concepts of dynamically coupled driving and <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> arediscussed. A general dynamics expression about the dynamically coupled driving andthe <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> are derived and its meaning is explained. As an example, a two-linkmodel is introduced to show the effect of the dynamically coupled driving and thejoint stops in detail. Based on the concepts of the dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops,</b> anew manipulator design method is proposed for enhancing robot dynamicperformance through utilizing the dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops.</b> Inthis method, the actuators and links of robots are designed as light as possible initiallyto resemble the smart structure of the human body. A design index (DI) is formulatedby the weighted sum of the desired dynamic performance and the boundary conditionson initial/final configurations. By increasing the load capabilities of the actuators stepby step, an iterative process of searching for the solution of DI Jtolerance withminimal torque needs is implemented to yield a robot design with the lightestmechanism and minimal needs for the torque and power. An important issue of this design method is searching for the solution ofDI tolerance J. This issue is formulated to be a motion planning problem withcomplicated constraints due to the human-like smart structure and the utilization ofthe dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops.</b> A new method based on activetorque approximation and the convex hull property of B-splines is then proposed. Inthis method, the active torques of joints are approximated by B-splines and the hardconstraints on the active torque are transformed to be a series of linear inequalities onthe coefficients of the B-spline. Through combining the active torque approximationwith a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm, the proposed motionplanning method provides superior numerical stability with high accuracy in motiongeneration which brings great benefit to the proposed manipulator design method. By utilizing the proposed motion planning method, a real hyper-dynamicmanipulator, namely a golf swing robot, is designed with the new design method. Based on the robot, different hyper-dynamic manipulation with different costfunctions, e. g., for minimizing total consumed work (TCW), for minimizing the sumof the squared derivatives of torque (SSDT), and for maximizing the impact speed(IS), is generated to investigate the characteristics of hyper-dynamic manipulation. Many meaningful and interesting results for the hyper-dynamic manipulation for atwo-joint manipulator are obtained in simulation. Moreover, by adopting thegenerated active torque trajectories as the feedforward inputs to the controller of thereal robot, and the motion trajectories as the reference inputs to a PD controller of therobot, experiments are carried out. The experimental results prove the utilization ofthe dynamically coupled driving and the <b>joint</b> <b>stops</b> and verify that the hyper-dynamicmanipulation can be successfully realized by a real robot. Additionally, since the golfclub shaft is flexible, a three-link model is developed to describe the real golf swingrobot more accurately and is approved by experiments. Though the numerical optimization method is triumphantly used to solve thenonlinear motion planning problem so as to utilize dynamically coupled driving inhyper-dynamic manipulation, it is necessary to develop a control method to directlydeal with the motion planning problem, a target dynamics based energy controlscheme is then proposed for motion planning. This scheme maps the two Degree ofFreedom (DOF) golf swing robot to a one-DOF harmonic oscillator system (targetdynamics). Based on the target system, energy control is used to realize a specifiedimpact speed at a specified impact position, and PD control and PD plus gravity,dynamically coupled driving torque and active torque compensation control areadopted to slow down and stop the swing. By using this control scheme, the torquecompensation from a joint with a high-power actuator to another joint with a lowpoweractuator is realized to achieve higher speed in hyper-dynamic manipulation. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
