It was suggested that ATL {{is caused by the}} infection of a retrovirus called ATLV. Strikingly, ATLV had the transforming activity in vitro. These studies established that the retrovirus infection is the cause of ATL. The retrovirus is now generally called HTLV-I because later studies proved that ATLV {{is the same as the}} firstly identified <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus</b> called HTLV discovered by Bernard Poiesz and Francis Ruscetti and their co-workers in the laboratory of Robert C.

50|$|There {{are only}} three {{putative}} IRG genes in humans out of which IRGM {{is known to be}} an orthologue of mouse Irgm1. There are four isoforms of IRGM (a-d). Unlike mouse IRGs, human IRGM isoforms are always expressed under the <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus</b> element ERV9 and are independent of the levels of IFNγ. IRGMb and d have a putative G5 (SAK) motif in their C terminal tail region while the other two isoforms do not. IRGMd appears diffuse in the cytoplasm and be translocated to the mitochondria appearing as punctate dots. Additionally, it has been shown to bind to mitochondrial membrane lipid, cardiolipin and influence a change in the morphology of organelle. In general human IRGs have also been shown to affect several processes such as autophagy, mitochondrial fission, change in mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death.|$|E

A practicing physician in the infectiology department of the Raymond-Poincaré hospital of Garches (directed by Prof. Christian Perronne, AP-HP), University lecturer Emeritus, he currently leads the treatment program ICCARRE that proposes a dramatic reduction of weekly anti-HIV drug intake, down to 2-3 anti-viral pills a day taken 2 to 3 or 4 days a week, as opposed to the presently recommended seven days a week, as still universally prescribed. These reduced medical dosages are adequate, necessary and sufficient according to the results of his exploratory clinical research carried out since 2003.He {{is the author of the}} books [...] "Un virus étrange venu d'ailleurs" [...] (A strange virus of unknown origin), and [...] "Pour en finir avec le sida" [...] (Putting an end to AIDS).|$|E
50|$|Bell was {{involved}} in identifying the outbreak in Lyndonville, New York, of what was known {{at the time as}} chronic Epstein-Barr virus (now more commonly referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome or CFS). When Bell was interviewed about the outbreak in a 1996 Prime Time Live episode, the reporter described Bell's appeal to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for help with the illness, but Bell says the CDC didn't mention a similar outbreak in Lake Tahoe, which he learned about later. He met with other CFS researchers at a 1987 conference, and joined an investigation with researchers Paul Cheney and Elaine DeFreitas involving a possible retrovirus association with chronic fatigue syndrome. In 1990, the researchers presented evidence they found DNA sequences very similar to a known <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus</b> in some CFS patients, at a conference in Kyoto, Japan. Their study was later published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A reporter on Prime Time Live stated the announcement made headlines all over the world. The CDC first ignored their findings, then later conducted a study and published a paper that refuted the hypothesis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s-80s, A. Voevodin {{worked at the}} Institute of Experimental Pathology and Therapy of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Sukhumi.

While being Head of AIDS Control Center of Russian Federation in the early 1990s he advocated targeted voluntary testing of high risk groups as opposed to universal mandatory screening. After collapse of the USSR for a year {{he worked at the}} Karolinska Hospital/Institute, Sweden. In 1993 he joined the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine.

The latter contributed to establishing the origin of HIV-1. In 1999 the Royal College of Pathologists, London, UK awarded him a title of Fellow (FRCPath) by virtue of his published research. In 2004 A.

25|$|Haseltine {{was one of}} {{the very}} few {{scientists}} in the late 1970s who continued to work on the concept that retroviruses played an important role in human diseases. This idea once popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s was abandoned by many after a decade or more of a futile search for <b>human</b> <b>retroviruses</b> by laboratories around the world. Haseltine, working with a few other scientists, thought that <b>human</b> <b>retroviruses</b> would behave differently from those that affect laboratory animals such as mice and would behave more like those that cause cancer and immunological deficiencies in non-laboratory animals. These viruses seem to disappear after early infection, the disease appearing only after several years. Haseltine devoted part of his laboratory to the study retroviruses in these animals in the hopes that they would provide insight into human disease. In 1978 he helped to design a special containment laboratory at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute to work on these viruses should they be discovered, later essential for his work on HIV/AIDS.|$|R
