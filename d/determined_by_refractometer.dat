40|$|Fig (Ficus carica L.) is {{an antique}} fruit species {{originated}} from Asia and {{spread all over}} the world. In Romania, many genotypes are found on mild climate zones, being cultivated in small gardens as ornamental and fruit plant. At the Bucharest Faculty of Horticulture recently, fig genotypes have been collected from different places, propagated and studied. This paper presents the first results regarding the characterization of some fig genotypes found in different areas of Romania. An Iraqian fig genotype was also characterized. On medium term, the team aims to identify local grown fig plants, to establish a fig distribution wide map in Romania and to analyse different plants parameters in order to decide the best genotypes to be planted in the future. Cuttings from different figs genotypes and different regions of Romania and Iraq were collected and rooted. After planting in pots, the new obtained plants where grown under controlled conditions for a year. By using the mother plants and/or the new propagated plants, several measurements and determinations were done in order to characterize each genotype. Leaves were studied and measured with Win Folia scanner and software, while fruits were observed, measured and total soluble solids was <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>refractometer.</b> The collected biotypes are planted in four testing plots in different regions in Romania...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} dipstick measurements of urine specific gravity (U-SG). METHODS: Fresh urine specimens were tested for urine pH and osmolality (U-pH, U-Osm) by a pH meter and an osmometer, and for U-SG by three different methods (refractometry, automatic readout of a dipstick (Clinitek- 50), and (visual) change of colour of the dipstick). RESULTS: The correlations between the visual U-SG dipstick measurements and U-SG <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a <b>refractometer</b> and the comparison of Clinitek((R)) - 50 dipstick U-SG measurements with U-Osm were less than optimal, showing very wide scatter of values. Only the U-SG refractometer values and U-Osm had a good linear correlation. The tested dipstick was unreliable for the bedside determination of U-SG, even after correction for U-pH, as recommended by the manufacturer. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bedside determinations, only refractometry gives reliable U-SG results. Dipstick U-SG measurements should be abandoned...|$|R
40|$|Watercore {{and sugar}} content are {{internal}} qualities which are impossible for exterior determination. Therefore {{the aims of}} this study were to develop models for nondestructive detection of watercore and predicting sugar content in pear using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) technique. A total of 93 samples of Asian pear variety "SH- 078 " were used. For sugar content, spectrum of each fruit was measured in the short wavelength region (700 – 1100 nm) in the reflection mode and the first derivative of spectra were then correlated with the sugar content in juice <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> digital <b>refractometer.</b> Prediction equation was performed by multiple linear regression. The result showed Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) = 0. 58 °Bx, and Bias= 0. 11. The result from t-test showed that sugar content predicted by NIR was not significantly different from the value analyzed <b>by</b> <b>refractometer</b> at 95 % confidence. For watercore disorder, NIR measurement was performed over the short wavelength range (700 – 850 nm) in the transmission mode. The first derivative spectra were correlated with internal qualities. Then principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) were used to perform discrimination models. The accuracy of the PCA model was greater than the PLSDA one. The scores from PC 1 were separated into two boundaries, one predicted rejected pears with 100 % classification accuracy, and the other was accepted pears with 92 % accuracy. The high accuracy of sugar content determining and watercore detecting by NIR reveal the high efficiency of NIR technique for detecting other internal qualities of fruit in the future...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{state of}} {{hydration}} {{is a very important}} aspect for athletes and coaches. According to NATA and ACSM athletes must be educated to maintain a good {{state of hydration}} and thus obtain better results. PURPOSE: To determine the state of hydration, before the sport practice of athletes (males) that belong to representative sports. METHODS: Seventy-five males college athletes, physically active and apparently healthy, were voluntarily recruited. They had an average height of 174. 8 ± 7. 4 cm, weight 87. 2 ± 24. 0 kg and age 21. 3 ± 2. 4 years. The athletes attended the study on a single spontaneous occasion, prior to the training session. Were given a questionnaire of hydration habits and a urine container (to collect a urine sample of their own). The urine gravity (UG) was <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> a urinary <b>refractometer</b> (ATAGO, Master-Sur/Na). RESULTS: Athletes had a urine gravity of 1. 024 ± 0. 006 UG, finding maximum values up to 1. 033 UG. Only 2. 6 % of the study population was well hydrated (1. 030 UG), which means a loss of fluid of 2 %, 4 % and more than 5 % of total body weight for hypohydration conditions. Athletes mentioned that during and one hour after exercise they drink 762. 3 ± 560. 2 mL and 644. 4 ± 362. 2 mL respectively, either water or isotonic drink. However, these liquid volume did not compensated the water deficiency with which they begin the practice of the exercise. CONCLUSION: Before the training, 97. 4 % of the subjects presented different level of hypohydration, including very severe hypohydration state. The fluid ingested after the training session did not disappear the hydration deficiency with which they begin the exercise...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the success}} of passive {{transfer}} of immunoglobulins is important because foals with failure of passive transfer {{are at increased risk}} for the development of infection and death during the first month of life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify which test is most suitable for determining the foal’s IgG concentration in practice. A distinction was made between hospitalized foals and healthy low risk foals in the field. One formula and several screening tests were compared to the IgG concentration measured by turbidimetric immunoassay: total protein, albumin and protein spectrum measured by chemistry analyzers, total protein measured <b>by</b> <b>refractometer</b> and IgG concentration <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> the SNAP Foal IgG Test Kit and glutaraldehyde coagulation test. Blood was collected from 46 foals of seven days of age or younger. The most reliable alternative test for determining the IgG concentration appeared to be the combination of total serum protein measured by a chemistry analyzer and gammaglobulin concentration. A total serum protein of ≥ 49 g/L and a gammaglobulin concentration of ≥ 6 g/L was corresponding with an IgG concentration of ≥ 8 g/L. If the immunoglobulin concentration has to be known in healthy low risk foals in the field, SNAP test can be an alternative test if its weaknesses are recognized...|$|R

5000|$|When a sugar {{solution}} is measured <b>by</b> <b>refractometer</b> or density meter, the °Bx or °P value obtained by {{entry into the}} appropriate table only represents the amount of dry solids dissolved in the sample if the dry solids are exclusively sucrose. This is seldom the case. Grape juice (must), for example, contains little sucrose but does contain glucose, fructose, acids and other substances. In such cases, the °Bx value clearly cannot be equated with the sucrose content, but it may represent a good approximation to the total sugar content. For example, an 11.0% by mass D-Glucose ("grape sugar") solution measured 10.9 °Bx using a hand held instrument. For these reasons, the sugar content of a solution obtained by use of refractometry with the ICUMSA table is often reported as [...] "Refractometric Dry Substance" [...] (RDS) which could {{be thought of as}} an equivalent sucrose content. Where it is desirable to know the actual dry solids content, empirical correction formulas can be developed based on calibrations with solutions similar to those being tested. For example, in sugar refining, dissolved solids can be accurately estimated from refractive index measurement corrected by an optical rotation (polarization) measurement.|$|R

ABSTRACT: In this work, a quantitative study for sugar concentration determination was conducted using Uv-Visible Spectroscopy. Glucose and Sucrose of three extracted plants fruit were analysis <b>by</b> <b>refractometer</b> and thin layer Chromatography before applied for quantitative determination. The TSS values recorded have a good agreement with the Sucrose standard and previously analyzed sugar in fruit and vegetables. TSS of Coach-fruit, Cactus Opuntia and Peel is 18 Bix%, 18 Brix % and 21 Brix % respectively. These results have a good precision with the TSS sugar found in Apple species (18. 83 Brix %), Potato species (19. 10 %) and Grape (17. 50 Brix %) fruit-vegetables. The single spot observed on TLC, assay the purity of sample. Calibration models for Glucose and Sucrose determination were developed using the standard solution. Sugar concentrations were determined from single standard and calibration curve. The mean concentrations of Sucrose and Glucose in Coach-fruit, Cactus pear and Cactus peel, were 143. 035 mg/ml, 42. 420 mg/ml, and 0. 943 mg/ml for Sucrose; and 86. 912 mg/ml, 18. 938 mg/ml and 8. 810 mg/ml for Glucose determined...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research project is to investigate dispersion {{as a method of}} quantifying geological characterization and defining reservoir heterogeneity in order to enhance crude oil recovery. The dispersion of flow of a reservoir rock (dispersion coefficient and dispersivity) was identified as one of the physical properties of a reservoir rock by measuring the mixing of two miscible fluids, one displacing the other in a porous medium. A rock was 100 % saturated with a resident fluid and displaced by a miscible fluid of equal viscosity and equal density. Some specific experiments were performed with unequal densities. Produced fluid was analyzed <b>by</b> <b>refractometer,</b> nuclear reaction, electrical conductivity and X-ray scan. Several physical and flow characteristics were measured on the sand rock sample in order to establish correlations with the measured dispersion property. Absolute permeability, effective porosity, relative permeability, capillary pressure, the heterogeneity factor and electrical conductivity were used to better understand the flow system. Linear, transverse, 2 -D and 3 -D dispersions were measured and used to characterize the rock heterogeneity of the flow system. A new system of measuring dispersion was developed using a gas displacing gas system in a porous medium.
