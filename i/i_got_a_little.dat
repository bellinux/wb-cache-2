5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. I feel that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E
500|$|And so {{the issue}} was brought up at the {{acceptance}} of the spacecraft, a long drawn-out discussion. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> annoyed, and I said, [...] "Look, there's no way there's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there's a spark or the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard. [...] We're not going to let them smoke." [...] Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, [...] "Go clean up the spacecraft. [...] Be sure that all the fire rules are obeyed." ...|$|E

When I was in Spain on Kingdom, I {{realized}} I could buy it back. It was an empty, damaging gesture." [...] In an interview with Collider.com he stated that, [...] "It was demoralizing to write a really good book and to realize how little the rewards were, even though the book did quite well, as far as first novels are concerned." [...] Light House was available in a German edition, translated by Ulrike Seeberger.|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, at the Australian Open, Levine beat Martín Vassallo Argüello of Argentina, a 26-year-old veteran ranked # 77 in the world, {{to advance}} to the Open's second round. [...] There, Levine played a scrappy match against fellow lefty, No. 24 seed Jarkko Nieminen. [...] But despite serving for the set at 5–3 in both the second and third sets, Levine went down 2–6, 5–7, 6–7(2–7) to the Finn. [...] "I felt like I was right there, and {{definitely}} had my chances {{in the second and third}} (sets). I have to work on converting a little better", said Levine. [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too antsy, and tried to go for a little too much, maybe stepped too hard on the pedal instead of taking a foot off." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sore. He knew darn well I was doing it because we {{could use a little}} money these days. Who can't?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E

60|$|And I'm {{bringing}} him up right, I tell you. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> savings box <b>a</b> while ago, and have got him taught {{to put all}} his money in it, and not give any of it away, {{so that when he}} grows up he'll be all right.|$|R

60|$|I {{went around}} and clumb {{over the back}} stile by the ash-hopper, {{and started for the}} kitchen. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world.|$|E

'My {{mother left}} {{me to my}} grandmother,' said Bounderby; 'and, {{according}} {{to the best of}} my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{work here}} and a little there; but still I was a burden at home rather than a bread-winner; and, at the closing-in of the winter, was very glad to hear of a place at two leagues' distance, where work, they said, was to be had. Off I set, one morning, to find it, but missed my way, somehow, until it was night-time before I arrived. Night-time and snow again; {{it seemed as if}} all my {{journeys}} were to be made in this bitter weather.|$|E
60|$|After that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fitful sleep, only to wake {{from time}} to time with a start, {{thinking}} that I was once more an actor in the terrible events of the last twenty-four hours.
