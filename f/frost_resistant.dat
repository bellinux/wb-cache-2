25|$|Because of the northerly climate, {{there has}} been a search for {{suitable}} grape varieties (particularly <b>frost</b> <b>resistant</b> and early harvesting ones), and many crosses have been developed, such as Müller-Thurgau in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. Recently {{there has been}} an increase in plantings of Riesling as local and international demand has been demanding high quality wines.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} viticultural hazards in the Muscadet region is {{winter and spring}} time frost and threat of mildew near harvest. The Melon de Bourgogne has adapted well to these {{condition}} being very <b>frost</b> <b>resistant</b> and capable of ripening early. Harvest usually takes place in mid to late September {{but in recent years}} producers have been experimented with harvesting the grapes several days to a couple weeks later. The traditional method is to harvest early in order to maintain acidity that is a key characteristic of Muscadet wine. The trend to pick later, and risk the threat of rains and mildew rot, is to give the grapes more time to develop sugars and riper phenols that can impart more fruit notes and complexity to the wine. However, these grapes that are picked later will usually experience a dramatic drop in acidity.|$|E
2500|$|S. keniensis is <b>frost</b> <b>resistant</b> to [...] This {{ability to}} {{withstand}} the colder temperatures {{that occur in the}} upper altitudes of Mount Kenya is in part due (at least in Lobelias) to the large amounts of mucilage which are contained by the rosettes of leaves which that might assist in preventing the leaf bud from freezing and the reservoir of fluid from evaporating. As well as the nyctinastic behavior of the leaf rosettes which open during the day and close tightly around the leaf bud and meristem when it becomes cold at night; [...] the outer leaves bend inwards and form around the central leaf bud.|$|E

2500|$|The Muscadet {{region is}} located at the westernmost edge of the Loire Valley near the city of Nantes. In the 17th century, Dutch wine merchants laid the {{foundation}} for the Muscadet style by encouraging the villagers of Nantes to plant the early ripening Melon de Bourgogne grape to use in the production of their brandewijndistilled wine with brandy added to it. Following the devastation in 1709 of winter frost to many of the vineyards in the Loire-Atlantique, King Louis XIV ordered that the <b>frost</b> <b>resistant</b> Melon de Bourgogne grape be given preferential treatment in the replanting of the area. Despite the inference of [...] "Muskiness" [...] in its name, Muscadet is a neutral flavor wine and the Melon de Bourgogne grape has no relation to the Muscat family of grapes.

The spikelets are in pairs, and there are three stamens.|$|R
500|$|Despite its {{prominence}} in the industry, the grape {{is a relatively new}} variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation—the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid <b>frost</b> and <b>resistant</b> to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects—and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character ("typicity") of the variety. Familiarity and ease of pronunciation have helped to sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even when from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a [...] "colonizer" [...] that takes over wine regions at the expense of native grape varieties.|$|R
