2500|$|Following {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 Nazi Germany disbanded Polish National Railways (PKP) immediately {{and handed over}} their assets to the Deutsche Reichsbahn in Silesia, Greater Poland and in Pomerania. The Polish management was either executed in mass shooting actions (see: the 1939 Intelligenzaktion and the 1940 German AB-Aktion in Poland) or imprisoned. The brand new Eastern division of DRB acquired [...] of new railway lines and 1,052km of (mostly industrial) narrow gauge in annexed areas. Managerial jobs were staffed with German officials {{in a wave of}} some 8,000 instant promotions. The first Polish agglomeration subjected to <b>forcible</b> <b>expulsion</b> of Polish nationals was the port city of Gdynia strategically important to Nazi Germany. Beginning in mid October 1939 (one and a half month after the attack), DRB began transporting expelled Polish families to Częstochowa, Kraków, Kielce and Lublin. The Poles were required to leave the keys in the doors of their homes and businesses, for the incoming families of German industrial workers and administration. Poles were given only a few hours to pack carry-on luggage, about [...] per person. In the grand total, 70,000-80,000 civilians have been expelled from Gdynia alone. The parallel expulsion of Poles from Silesia entailed the forcible displacement of some 18,000–20,000 people during Action Saybusch; the number of Poles deported from the region grew to around 50,000 before 1944. Meanwhile, the total number of Polish nationals expelled from all Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany reached 923,000.|$|E

The kidnapping the child was a crime much more consistent with their habits than with those of smugglers, and his temporary guardian might have fallen in an attempt to protect him.

However, within few weeks after his arrival on 8 October 2011, Martin Kobler internally announced a change of strategy to the UNAMI staff, presuming that residents of Camp Ashraf were [...] "terrorists" [...] and that the Government could {{not be expected to}} negotiate with [...] "terrorists", thus UNAMI's new goal would be a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Iraq aimed to induce relocation. Bowing to Government's ultimatum to expel the residents by end of the year, this agreement was signed end of December 2011. In the course of the process, the Government had rejected any attempt to find a solution acceptable to all parties concerned, under inclusion of the residents, and which preserved their acquired rights, resulting in a mere displacement, without consent and participation by the residents, to the new temporary transit location Camp Liberty (Camp Hurriya in Arabic) in Baghdad (a onetime U.S. Marine base), where UNHCR would start to determine the resident's eligibility for refugee status.|$|R
60|$|For {{a day or}} {{two after}} this <b>forcible</b> <b>expulsion</b> from the vicarage, Mr. Solsgrace {{continued}} his residence at Moultrassie Hall, where the natural melancholy attendant on his situation added to the gloom of the owner of the mansion. In the morning, the ejected divine made excursions to different families in the neighbourhood, to whom his ministry had been acceptable in the days of his prosperity, and from whose grateful recollections of that period he now found sympathy and consolation. He did not require to be condoled with, because he was deprived of an easy and competent maintenance, and thrust out upon the common of life, after he had reason to suppose he would be no longer liable to such mutations of fortune. The piety of Mr. Solsgrace was sincere; and if he had many of the uncharitable prejudices against other sects, which polemical controversy had generated, and the Civil War brought to a head, he had also that deep sense of duty, by which enthusiasm is so often dignified, and held his very life little, if called upon to lay it down in attestation of the doctrines in which he believed. But he was soon to prepare for leaving the district which Heaven, he conceived, had assigned to him as his corner of the vineyard; he was to abandon his flock to the wolf--was to forsake those with whom he had held sweet counsel in religious communion--was to leave the recently converted to relapse into false doctrines, and forsake the wavering, whom his continued cares might have directed into the right path,--these were of themselves deep causes of sorrow, and were aggravated, doubtless, by those natural feelings with which all men, especially those whose duties or habits have confined them to a limited circle, regard the separation from wonted scenes, and their accustomed haunts of solitary musing, or social intercourse.|$|E

But as compared with the conventional good father who deliberately imposes himself on his son as a god; who takes advantage of childish credulity and parent worship to persuade his son that what he approves of is right and what he disapproves of is wrong; who imposes a corresponding conduct on the child by a system of prohibitions and penalties, rewards and eulogies, for which he claims divine sanction: compared to this sort of abortionist and monster maker, I say, Place appears almost as a Providence. Not {{that it is possible to}} live with children any more than with grown-up people without imposing rules of conduct on them. There is a point at which every person with human nerves has to say to a child [...] "Stop that noise." [...] But suppose the child asks why! There are various answers in use. The simplest: [...] "Because it irritates me," [...] may fail; for it may strike the child as being rather amusing to irritate you; also the child, having comparatively no nerves, may be unable to conceive your meaning vividly enough. In any case it may want to make a noise more than to spare your feelings. You may therefore have to explain that the effect of the irritation will be that you will do something unpleasant if the noise continues. The something unpleasant may be only a look of suffering to rouse the child's affectionate sympathy (if it has any), or it may run to <b>forcible</b> <b>expulsion</b> from the room with plenty of unnecessary violence; but the principle is the same: there are no false pretences involved: the child learns in a straightforward way that it does not pay to be inconsiderate. Also, perhaps, that Mamma, who made the child learn the Sermon on the Mount, is not really a Christian.|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} {{the experience of a}} small returnee community in Kozarac, North-West Bosnia. It is a longitudinal study of {{a group of people who}} set out to reclaim their homes and rebuild their community after expulsion and violence at the hands of their neighbours. The aim is to investigate how these traumatic experiences were utilised as a motivational vehicle for the return, and how they influenced the character of the post-return community. The study also looks critically at the “memory industry” and trauma studies that claim to put the victim at the centre, but sometimes, through their intervention and focus on narrative, actually deprive their subjects of agency. Returning home is explored as a journey in which social actors actively seek to re-establish social and individual relations as part of a process of recovery, focusing on how they use rituals of mourning and remembering to do so. The thesis centres around a qualitative case study based on several years of participatory observation. Avoiding interviews, my aim was to reach a deeper understanding of the communal everyday social practices and individual coping strategies in a place that continues to be burdened with the legacy of a violent past, embodied in its physical landscape and asymmetrical power relations. I also consider the international dimension to the locale, and the role of international actors, considering whether local power struggles are only the result of the war experience and a continuation of nationalist postwar politics, or whether the presence of international agencies may also have had “unanticipated consequences” in contributing to a lack of progress in Bosnian society. The study draws from various anthropological sources on memory and social reconstruction, but also clinical and cognitive psychologists’ analyses of what the experience of <b>forcible</b> <b>expulsion</b> entails for an individual and their health. Whilst some studies have concluded that people have relocated within the country in search for safety and economic advantages within their own ethnic group, my findings illustrate that emotional ties to the original home, for the inhabitants of Kozarac, remain the key driver for return. However, the study also suggests that post-return, the Kozarac community has moved on to focus on other issues that will ultimately determine whether the community can be sustained over time...|$|E
