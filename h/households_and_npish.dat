In the system for recording economic accounts, only the government and <b>households</b> <b>and</b> <b>NPISH</b> sectors have final consumption. In addition, for households and pension funds, there is an adjustment item in the account which reflects the way that transactions between households and pension funds are recorded.The balancing item for this account and for the whole group of distribution and use of income accounts is gross saving. It {{is only in the}} case of non-financial corporations (public and private) that undistributed income and saving are equivalent.|$|E

We reinforce some of the views expressed by many authors quoted in this note, that the national accounts estimate of household final consumption, as used in the current procedures to estimate poverty, is not appropriate. We also try to clarify some misconceptions of the national accounts procedures and methods of estimation of final <b>household</b> consumption, <b>and</b> suggest ways for supplementing household surveys with individual consumption of government and non-profit institutions serving <b>households</b> (<b>NPISHs)</b> <b>and</b> other components from national accounts not generally captured through household surveys 1.

This paper will present the methodology and the main results obtained for the non-market sector. First of all there will be a presentation of the general framework of the volume estimation for the total economy and then the methods used for General Governments(GG) and Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISHs) will be illustrated. It will be done with reference to the theoretical schemes, stated by Eurostat, and for the various service industries in which GG <b>and</b> <b>NPISHs,</b> activities has been split {{according to}} the new accounting system. We will try to go further on with some consideration on the measure of productivity for the GG sector, which should be considered only as a first exercise in this stimulating and extremely interesting field, in that we consider at this stage only the labour productivity...|$|R
