5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. <b>His</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of murdering his mother in law.

Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to <b>his</b> <b>attorney</b> to pay for his defence.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted <b>his</b> <b>Attorney</b> General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal politics by nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. <b>His</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Leaf {{was indicted}} on {{burglary}} and controlled-substance charges in Texas. He {{was in a}} drug-rehabilitation program in British Columbia {{at the time of}} the indictment, and was arrested by customs agents at the border on his return to the U.S as he was intending to fly to Texas to surrender on the indictment. However, <b>his</b> <b>attorney</b> Jeffrey A. Lustick successfully blocked the fugitive warrant extradition process, therefore legally allowing Leaf to go to Texas on his own. Lustick later successfully got the Washington fugitive action against Leaf dismissed with prejudice. On June 17, he posted a $45,000 bond in Washington state for the criminal charges in Texas. In April 2010, he pleaded guilty in Amarillo, Texas to seven counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud and one count of delivery of a simulated controlled substance, all felonies. State District Judge John B. Board sentenced him to ten years of probation and fined him $20,000.|$|E

Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday.

5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. <b>His</b> <b>attorney</b> argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another charge for the crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|The {{police were}} {{satisfied}} with the new story, and both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Georgian gave the story front-page coverage. Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the Journal. They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building, intending to rob her, but found Phagan was an easier target. The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without <b>his</b> <b>attorney,</b> who was out of town. The police were quoted in The Atlanta Constitution saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.|$|E
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001.

Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; <b>his</b> <b>attorney</b> asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13.
