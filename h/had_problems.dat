5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; <b>having</b> no <b>problems,</b> <b>having</b> some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I <b>have</b> no <b>problems</b> in walking about", [...] "I <b>have</b> some <b>problems</b> in walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates <b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> for 1, <b>having</b> some <b>problems</b> for 2, and <b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (<b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> in all dimensions) to 33333 (<b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> in all dimensions). 12321 indicates <b>having</b> no <b>problems</b> in mobility and anxiety/depression, <b>having</b> slight <b>problems</b> in self-care and pain/discomfort, and <b>having</b> extreme <b>problems</b> in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R
