Four-base-out is a distance method because suppression scotomas in micro-strabismus is usually small and by using a near target, the examiner might cause the image of the target to land outside of said suppression zone and any signs of micro-strabismus or monofixation might be masked.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} emergence of a new language for agency in nineteenth-century literature and science, which articulated a form of intersubjectivity that departed from a central element of Victorian liberal ideology: the emphasis on the autonomous will as key to the advancement of civilization. I show that writers like Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Wilkie Collins understand character development as importantly physiological, reflecting a movement in Victorian psychology that, for the first time, proposed a scientific account of the relationship between body and mind. The novels I take up do not necessarily affirm the kind of <b>isolated,</b> <b>distanced</b> individual that is typically associated with Victorian liberalism and the form of the novel. Instead, the relationship between body and agency is often imagined as a play of affective influence, constituting the theorization of an embodied intersubjective agency able to form and transform character through connections between bodies. As I show, this deviates from hallowed liberal ideals such as self-formation, the linear development of individual and society, the idea of evolutionary progress, and the role of a rational intellect in producing moral behavior...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{population}} size (Ne) {{is an important}} parameter in conservation genetics because it quantifies a population’s capacity to resist loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding and drift. The classical approach to estimate Ne from genetic data involves grouping sampled individuals into discretely defined subpopulations assumed to be panmictic. Importantly, this assumption does not capture the continuous nature of populations genetically <b>isolated</b> by <b>distance.</b> Alternative approaches based on Wright’s genetic neighborhood concept quantify the local number of breeding individuals (NS) in a continuous population (as opposed to the global Ne). However, they {{do not reflect the}} potential for NS to vary spatially nor do they account for the resistance of a heterogeneous landscape to gene flow (isolation by resistance). Here, we describe an application of Wright’s neighborhood concept that provides spatially-explicit estimates of local NS from genetic data in continuous populations <b>isolated</b> by <b>distance</b> or resistance. We delineated local neighborhoods surrounding each sampled individual based on sigma (), a measure of the local extent of breeding. When  was known, the linkage disequilibrium method applied to local neighborhoods produced unbiased estimates of NS that were highly variable across the landscape. NS near the periphery or areas surrounded by high resistance was as much as an order of magnitude lower compared to the center, raising the potential for a spatial component to extinction vortex dynamics in continuous populations. When  is not known, it may be estimated from genetic data, but two methods we evaluated identified analysis extents that produced considerable bias or error in the estimate of NS. When  is known or accurately estimated, and the assumptions of Wright’s neighborhood are met, the method we describe provides spatially explicit information regarding short-term genetic processes that may inform conservation genetic analyses and management...|$|R

Consistent with other research, this qualitative study with 18 partners and ex-partners found that gambling problems created undue financial stresses and strains that impacted on partners’ financial security and the quality of their lives. Additionally, the research also showed that gambling problems created considerable negative impacts on partners’ emotional wellbeing, shaping experiences of distress, frustration, fear and other emotional responses which affected their ability to function and cope with the demands of their situations and their everyday lives. This, in turn, lead to mental and physical health symptoms and contributed to growing challenges and conflicts in their relationships, which for some resulted in separation or divorce.

40|$|Coral reef {{recovery}} from major disturbance is hypothesized {{to depend on}} the arrival of propagules from nearby undisturbed reefs. Therefore, reefs <b>isolated</b> by <b>distance</b> or current patterns are thought to be highly vulnerable to catastrophic disturbance. We found that on an isolated reef system in north Western Australia, coral cover increased from 9 % to 44 % within 12 years of a coral bleaching event, despite a 94 % reduction in larval supply for 6 years after the bleaching. The initial increase in coral cover was the result of high rates of growth and survival of remnant colonies, followed by a rapid increase in juvenile recruitment as colonies matured. We show that isolated reefs can recover from major disturbance, and that the benefits of their isolation from chronic anthropogenic pressures can outweigh the costs of limited connectivity...|$|R

The amount of genetic differentiation among collections was approximately 3 times as great as detected among collections in an earlier study in northeastern Mexico. Regression analysis of linear or road distances on linearized F(ST) indicated that collections are genetically <b>isolated</b> by <b>distance.</b> Cluster analysis failed to group collections in geographic proximity, and there was as much genetic variation among collections 60 km apart as there was among all collections (approximately 900 -km range).
