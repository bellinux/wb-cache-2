40|$|Tilmicosin (TLM), a {{macrolide}} antibiotic {{currently used}} {{for treatment of}} respiratory diseases in large animals (Micotil®, Elanco), has recently obtained the MRL extension for rabbits. To compare its metabolic pattern with that reported in cattle, swine, chicken and sheep, its biotransformation was studied in vitro using liver microsomes and hepatocyte primary cultures obtained from rabbit liver. HPLC analysis of hepatocyte extracted medium collected after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hrs of incubation showed several peaks eluting {{before and after the}} parent compound; however, their low concentrations did not allow further structural identification. No metabolites were detected in microsome incubation. TLM was then incubated with liver microsomes from rifampicin induced rabbits, according to metabolic profiles obtained and the evidence that macrolides are mainly metabolised by P 4503 A subfamily as well. The abundance of the metabolites produced allowed LC/MSn analysis; the masses obtained at m/z 869, m/z 855, m/z 871 and m/z 885 matched the structures of the parent compound and of demethylated, reduced and oxidised TLM, respectively.

40|$|The {{apoprotein}} {{expression and}} the catalytic activities of cytochrome P 450 s {{involved in the}} biotransformation of xenobiotics were investigated in horse liver microsomes and {{compared with those of}} food producing (cattle, pigs, broiler chicks, and rabbits) and laboratory species (rats).

40|$|The {{presence}} of horse meat in food products destined {{for human consumption}} and labelled as beef has raised several concerns of public interest. This review deals solely with one aspect of these concerns; samples of equine tissue from horses destined for the human food chain have {{tested positive for the}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, phenylbutazone. The safety of some or all such foods for human consumers is a major concern, because it was shown many years ago that phenylbutazone therapy in humans can be associated with life threatening blood dyscrasias. As an initial basis for assessing the potential toxicity of foods containing phenylbutazone and its metabolites, this article reviews (1) the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, metabolic and toxicological profiles of phenylbutazone, with particular reference to horses and humans; (2) toxicity data in laboratory animals; (3) phenylbutazone residues in <b>food</b> <b>producing</b> <b>species,</b> and (4) as a preliminary assessment, the potential hazard associated with the consumption of horse meat containing phenylbutazone and its metabolites. Since phenylbutazone cannot be classified as a carcinogenic substance in humans, and noting that blood dyscrasias in humans are likely to be dose and treatment duration-dependent, the illegal and erratic {{presence of}} trace amount residues of phenylbutazone in horse meat is not a public health issue...|$|E
40|$|Enrofloxacin (ENR) is an {{antimicrobial}} {{used both}} in humans and in <b>food</b> <b>producing</b> <b>species.</b> Its control {{is required in}} farmed species and their surroundings {{in order to reduce}} the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus, a new biomimetic sensor enrofloxacin is presented. An artificial host was imprinted in specific polymers. These were dispersed in 2 -nitrophenyloctyl ether and entrapped in a poly(vinyl chloride) matrix. The potentiometric sensors exhibited a near-Nernstian response. Slopes expressing mV/Δlog([ENR]/M) varied within 48 – 63. The detection limits ranged from 0. 28 to 1. 01 µg mL− 1. Sensors were independent from the pH of test solutions within 4 – 7. Good selectivity was observed toward potassium, calcium, barium, magnesium, glycine, ascorbic acid, creatinine, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline. In flowing media, the biomimetic sensors presented good reproducibility (RSD of ± 0. 7 %), fast response, good sensitivity (47 mV/Δlog([ENR]/M), wide linear range (1. 0 × 10 − 5 – 1. 0 × 10 − 3 M), low detection limit (0. 9 µg mL− 1), and a stable baseline for a 5 × 10 − 2 M acetate buffer (pH 4. 7) carrier.

Eighty homegardens (five from each farm category {{in each of the}} four regions) were assessed in terms of structure, species composition and diversity of the perennial species. Ordination of floristic data from the 80 homegardens showed a distinction between the Dry and the other regions due to a combination of lower species richness in the Dry region homegardens and several species exclusive to the regions. Floristic differences led to less marked but nevertheless important differences among the other regions, also. Most species were planted in the border of the homegardens irrespective of farm size and region. <b>Food</b> and fruit <b>producing</b> <b>species</b> dominated near the living quarter and working areas and small plots of annual vegetables and crops separated this part of the garden from the more distant parts favoured for timber species. Six vertical strata were recognised with higher plant density and species richness recorded in the lower three (< 7 m). In total ninety two perennial species were recorded for the set of 80 homegardens surveyed. From gardens in the Deltaic region 67 species were recorded. Corresponding figures were 56 for the Plain region, 54 for the Hilly region and 46 for the Dry region. Diversity was highest among <b>food</b> and fruit <b>producing</b> <b>species,</b> followed by the timber species. Indigenous management techniques in homegardens were investigated using different PRA methods. Farmers' used all sorts of planting materials to regenerate homegardens plants. Homegarden provided more than three quarters of the required planting materials. Mother trees were selected for fruit species only. Farmers practised simple cultural operations (weeding and pruning) which were rarely intensive.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} {{of land use}} in the tropics has typically been lost when species-rich natural vegetation has been cleared {{to make way for}} monocultures of improved staple food crops grown intensively with high inputs of agrochemicals. These intensive fanning systems have indeed helped to feed growing human populations, but at an environment cost that cannot be tolerated into the future. One suggestion for an acceptable alternative that both feeds the people and restores some of the diversity found in natural vegetation, is the development of lower input agroecosystems that combine the cultivation of 'Green Revolution' staple food crops with a number of the indigenous <b>food</b> <b>producing</b> tree <b>species</b> that can restore ecosystem function. This return towards more traditional land use practices can be enhanced by the judicious development of high quality, high yielding cultivars of the trees through the adaptation of standard horticultural practices, and planting of these cultivars in agroforests.

40|$|Introduction Hydroxylated {{metabolites}} {{of testosterone}} (T) {{have been proposed}} as useful markers of specific isoform P 450 activity in rats (1). Only {{few studies have been}} devoted to characterisation of P 450 biotransformation activity in <b>food</b> <b>producing</b> <b>species</b> thus the aim {{of this study was to}} define the influence of sex and age in rabbits on the metabolic profile of hydroxylated testosterone (OHT) metabolites using an HPLC method able to separate nine metabolites. The role played by CYP 3 A was also studied in Rifampicin (RIF) induced rabbits. Material and methods Liver microsomes were obtained (2) from rabbits. five male (3 ± 0. 4 kg), five female (3 ± 0. 2 kg), five young male (1, 5 ± 0, 3 kg), and two male induced with RIF (50 mg/kg, 4 days, ip). Microsomes (0. 2 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 min, at 37 °C with 250 µM T. Hydroxylated metabolites were extracted with methylene chloride and separated according to Purdon (3) with HPLC using a C 18 column and ternary phase gradient elution. Elution times were compared with those of pure standards (Steraloids). Discussion Main differences are: the absence in males of 16 alfa-OHT; the greater production (*P< 0, 001) of 6 beta-OHT, 11 alfa-OHT, 16 beta-OHT and 2 beta-OHT compared to females; the decreased production (#P< 0. 001) of 6 beta-OHT and 16 alfa-OHT in young rabbits versus adult ones. Based on data reported for other species (1, 4) apparently, the isoforms involved in rabbits are CYP 3 A for 6 beta-OHT, and 2 beta-OHT; and CYP 2 B for 16 alfa-OHT, and 16 beta-OHT. RIF induced microsomes gave a significantly (°P< 0, 001) greater quantities of 6 beta-OHT, 2 beta-OHT supporting, also in rabbits, the CYP 3 A role played in the production of these hydroxyl-derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In {{mammalian}} species, phenobarbital (PB) {{has long}} been known to induce liver phase I metabolism, via activation of specific nuclear receptors (NRs), and phase II biotransformations as well. Nevertheless, the pattern of the in vivo modulation of oxidative, hydrolytic and conjugative drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) by this barbiturate has never been characterized in cattle. In the present study DME catalytic activity and expression were determined in liver subfractions from PB-induced or untreated cattle. Samples from the same animals were used for RNA isolation, cDNA cloning and sequencing of some bovine liver CYPs and their transcription factor (i. e. NR) as reported in Cantiello et al. (1). The ubiquitin (Ub) -dependent 26 S proteasome system was also investigated, in view of the key role played in the proteolytic disposal of structurally aberrant, abnormal, and/or otherwise malformed proteins, including cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) which may be damaged as the result of their catalytic activity. Materials and methods Seven male 10 months old-Friesian cattle were obtained from local farms. Four individuals received PB (18 mg/Kg b. w. /day for 7 days) by oral gavage, while the remainders remained untreated (UT). Liver subcellular fractions were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation (3) and used to measure both the haemoprotein content and the rate of the in vitro metabolism of several phase I and phase II substrates (3, 4), that, based on studies performed in human, rodent and <b>food</b> <b>producing</b> <b>species</b> (5, 6), are reported to be markers for a number of oxidative or conjugative isozymes. Flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) activities were measured with methimazole or ethylene thiourea as substrates, according to published procedures. Apoprotein levels were measured by western blotting analysis as described (3). Proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity in liver extracts was assayed by monitoring in continuo the production of 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (amc) from the fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-amc (7). Data were analysed by Student’s t-test. Results and discussion As partly depicted in Table 1, PB enhanced most of the tested microsomal enzyme activities (1 - to 19 -fold increase). It is relevant to note that, as previously observed in primary cultures of hepatocytes from ruminant species (8), PB failed to significantly increase the rate of pentoxyresorufin O-depentylation, which is reported to be an extremely specific marker for CYP 2 B activity in rodents (9). As regards testosterone hydroxylation, there was an increase in the generation of 2 β- (about 4 -fold), 6 β- (3 -fold) and 16 β- (3 -fold) OH-derivatives in treated vs control samples. As expressed as per nmole of CYP (turnover number) statistically significant changes were obtained for benzyloxyresorufin O-deethylase (7. 5 -fold; P< 0. 01), aminopyrine N-demethylase (2 -fold; P< 0. 05) and 7 -methoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-demethylase (9 -fold; P< 0. 001). Western immunoblots revealed a consistent increase in the expression of CYP 2 B-, CYP 2 C- and CYP 3 A-related proteins (2. 6, 2. 2 and 3. 4 fold, respectively). As expected, PB did not augment FMO activities measured with either substrate, both in the presence or in the absence of CYP inhibitors (n-octylamine). Proteasome activity in liver extracts from PB-treated animals was about twice as that found in untreated controls (P< 0. 001), suggesting a PB-mediated increase in the amount of damaged hemoproteins. In line with results of previous experiments performed in calves (10), microsomal carboxylesterase activities toward different aromatic esters were slightly induced by the treatment, showing a significant increase only in the case of -naphthylacetate (about 1. 5 -fold; P< 0. 05). Glutathione S-transferase was not induced by the treatment, either using 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -nitrobenzene (CDNB) or 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene (DCNB) as the substrates, whereas a modest rise (about 1. 4 -fold) in uridinediphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity was observed using p-nitrophenol (pNP) as substrate. It is well known that some isoenzymes of UGT 1 family are inducible by PB, although this phenomenon may be underestimated because of the considerable overlapping substrate specificity displayed by the multiple transferase isoforms. As an example, either pNP or 1 -naphthol are routinely used to assess the conjugative capacity of certain UGT 1 isoenzymes (UGT 1 A 6 and UGT 1 A 1, respectively); however, neither of them can be considered as a specific substrate of any UGT (11). Further research is in progress to evaluate CYP mRNA levels and to confirm the involvement of CAR and other NRs in the induction mechanisms...|$|E
