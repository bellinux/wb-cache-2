The anthraquinone is a redox catalyst. The reaction mechanism may involve single electron transfer (SET). The anthraquinone is oxidizing the reducing end of polysaccharides in the pulp, i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose, and thereby protecting it from alkaline degradation (peeling). The anthraquinone is reduced to 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene which then can react with lignin. The lignin is degraded and becomes more water-soluble and thereby more easy to wash away from the pulp, while the antraquinone is regenerated.

40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can delignify and {{brighten}} unbleached hardwood kraft pulp {{within a few}} days, but softwood kraft pulps require longer treatment. To determine the contributions of higher residual lignin contents (<b>kappa</b> <b>numbers)</b> and structural differences in lignins to the recalcitrance of softwood kraft pulps to biobleaching, we tested softwood and hardwood pulps cooked to the same <b>kappa</b> <b>numbers,</b> 26 and 12. A low-lignin-content (overcooked) softwood pulp resisted delignification by T. versicolor, but a high-lignin-content (lightly cooked) hardwood pulp was delignified {{at the same rate}} as a normal softwood pulp. Thus, the longer time taken by T. versicolor to brighten softwood kraft pulp than hardwood pulp results from the higher residual lignin content of the softwood pulp; possible differences in the structures of the residual lignins are important only when the lignin becomes highly condensed. Under the conditions used in this study, when an improved fungal inoculum was used, six different softwood pulps were all substantially brightened by T. versicolor.

Ten trees, ten years old, {{had been selected}} at random from a single plantation in Jamaica and the first, fifth and ninth in order of density were pulped to assess the differences in pulping characteristics that {{might be due to}} density. Two digestions, one with 17. 5 % active alkali, one with 20 % were made on each tree using otherwise identical conditions. At both alkali doses yields of pulp increased with increasing density of the wood and, unexpectedly, the <b>Kappa</b> <b>numbers</b> of the pulps from the medium density wood were higher than those of either of the others. The breaking lengths and bursting strengths decreased and the bulk increased with increasing density. When compared at equal digestion conditions, the tearing strengths increased but to a peak with medium density. This was influenced by the higher <b>Kappa</b> <b>numbers</b> of the pulps from medium density wood and, when compared at equal <b>Kappa</b> <b>numbers,</b> the tearing strength showed a marked increase as the wood density increased from low to medium, and a smaller increase as it increased from medium to high density.

Because of the limited scale of this trial {{and the fact that the}} medium density sample yielded pulps with <b>Kappa</b> <b>numbers</b> completely out of line with the pulps from the other two samples, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between density and pulping characteristics, or the merit of density for predicting the quality of pulp. However, in this and in earlier similar work (Tropical Products Institute Report L 25) it appears that low density trees can have the economic disadvantage of not only higher handling costs but also lower pulp yields per bone dry ton, and the technical disadvantage of giving the lowest tearing strength although with somewhat higher bonding strengths. The choice between medium and highest density is obscure.
