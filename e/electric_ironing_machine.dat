This paper also showed the design process for designing the user interface and the industrial design of the <b>electric</b> <b>iron</b> and how these two areas could be merged seamlessly using the same design language, design elements and strategies...|$|R

The results illustrate that the reliability and efficiency of existing drive system are lower. Therefore, improvement measures are proposed: use high-quality bush roller chain that shall be regularly maintained and changed; the chain drive shall be replaced with gear drive. <b>Ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a washing <b>machine.</b> The traditional <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is mainly equipped {{with one or two}} rollers; modern <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> consists 3 ~ 6 rollers for high efficiency, so which is called multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine.</b> Chain drive in the machine has simple structure, costs low and is easy to maintain, but gear and chain slippage even chain scission accident can happen after wear [1]. Multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a continuous-working machine, so serious accident due to poor quality can be caused by failure in the drive system. The drive system of 4 -roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> i...|$|R

50|$|In {{the industrialized}} world, these designs have been {{superseded}} by the <b>electric</b> <b>iron,</b> which uses resistive heating from an electric current. The hot plate, called the sole plate, {{is made of}} aluminium or stainless steel polished to be as smooth as possible; it is sometimes coated with a low-friction heat-resistant plastic to reduce friction below that of the metal plate. The heating element is controlled by a thermostat that switches the current on and off to maintain the selected temperature. The invention of the resistively heated <b>electric</b> <b>iron</b> is credited to Henry W. Seeley of New York City in 1882. In the same year an iron heated by a carbon arc was introduced in France, but was too dangerous to be successful. The early <b>electric</b> <b>irons</b> had {{no easy way to}} control their temperature, and the first thermostatically controlled <b>electric</b> <b>iron</b> appeared in the 1920s. Later, steam was used to iron clothing. Credit for the invention of the steam iron goes to Thomas Sears. The first commercially available <b>electric</b> steam <b>iron</b> was introduced in 1926 by a New York drying and cleaning company, Eldec, but was not a commercial success. The patent for an <b>electric</b> steam <b>iron</b> and dampener was issued to Max Skolnik of Chicago in 1934. In 1938 Skolnik granted the Steam-O-Matic Corporation of New York the exclusive right to manufacture steam-electric irons. This was the first steam iron to achieve any degree of popularity, and led the way to more widespread use of the <b>electric</b> steam <b>iron</b> during the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
