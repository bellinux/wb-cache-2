There will not then be that backwardness to do good, and to receive God, {{as there is in}} these more dry and empty days of the gospel. As gold is pleasing to the covetous man and worldling, so shall the ways of God be to the saints and godly at that day. Now we have strong corruptions and weak grace, but then we shall have strong grace and weak withered corruptions. You that are spiritual, you know what an high and goodly lifting up of heart one small gale of the good Spirit of God will make in your souls, how it will make your lusts to languish, and your souls to love, and take pleasure in the Lord that saves you. You know, I say, what a flame of love, and bowels, and compassion, and self-denial, and endeared affection to God and all saints, it will beget in the soul.

60|$|I was {{drifting}} about a reedy bay (the same bay {{in which}} the almost forgotten kingfisher had cheated {{me out of my}} bear, after eating a minnow that my paddle had routed out for him) shooting frogs for my table with a pocket rifle. How different it was here, I reflected, from the woods about home. There the game was already harried; the report of a gun set every living creature skulking. Here the crack of my little rifle was no more heeded than the plunge of a fish-hawk, or the groaning of a burdened elm bough. A score of fat woodcock lay unheeding in that bit of alder tangle yonder, the ground bored like a colander after their night's feeding. Up on the burned hillside the partridges said, quit, quit! when I appeared, and jumped to a tree and craned their necks to see what I was. The black ducks skulked in the reeds. They were full-grown now and strong of wing, but the early hiding habit was not yet broken up by shooting. They would glide through the sedges, and double the bogs, and crouch in a tangle till the canoe was almost upon them, when with a rush and a frightened hark-ark! they shot into the air and away to the river. The mink, changing from brown to black, gave up his nest-robbing for honest hunting, undismayed by trap or deadfall; and up in the inlet I could see grassy domes rising above the bronze and gold of the marsh, where Musquash was building thick and high for winter cold and spring floods. Truly it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> and to enter for a brief hour into the shy, wild but unharried life of the wood folk.|$|E

Before I give what I {{describe}} as my neo-Kierkegaardian {{view of the}} professions {{with a dash of}} post-modern theology thrown in, I want {{to say that this is}} a tremendously useful conference. It is useful for professionals, by which I mean people who work in self-governing professions, to meditate from time to time on what it is that makes professions special. However, my remarks <b>are</b> going <b>to</b> take this conference in a slightly different direction than some of the issues raised this morning, because I have something of a contrary view about the role of professions—both the source and nature of the public obligation of professions. I would suggest that it is actually not helpful to try to figure out what professions have in common. On the contrary, to figure out what tlley have in common constitutes a kind of dangerous leveling of groups that in important ways we ought to keep radically separate. In fact, it is even in some ways a little bit dangerous to think in terms of the ways that professions fit neatly into American society. One of the reasons I call my remarks neo-Kierkegaardian, is that I am not persuaded that professions should try to fit into American society...|$|R
30|$|Multi-level {{governance}} <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> concept <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed <b>here</b> {{because it}} refers to steering and coordinating the interdependencies between different territorial levels based on negotiation or competition through the cooperation {{of public and private}} actors who are embedded in an institutional rule-making system within each level (Benz 2010). In this study we examine these different levels to understand the governance system as a whole because there are institutions (rules) and actors on different levels that contribute to the governance process. Although multi-level governance brings together the different levels in a case of environmental governance, its definition can be quite confusing and incomplete when we include the relationship between local communities and the government. Thus, to perform an all-encompassing analysis of the complex management situation we wish to analyze, we follow Berkes et al. (1991) and understand multi-level governance as co-management.|$|R

40|$|Glass work {{is one of}} such branches, which {{affected}} the regional development and general character of not only Jablonec region, but also the whole N othern Czechia. The very inception of glass work in this region is strongly connected with German collonisation. People,who came to this Czech border area, were originally from relatively crowded German regions. Such suitable natural conditions as e. g. deep forests, mountain rivers, it all made glass work possible. On this base, metallurgy followed by glass workshops, especially centred on abrasive technologies. In Nothern Czechia, there are vety exhausting climate conditions; the soil bonity is very poor as well. These facts influenced the economic structure and activities of its inhabitants.
