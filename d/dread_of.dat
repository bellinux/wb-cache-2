5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been ascribed {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> mortality.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of affairs for Parliament was perhaps {{at its worst}} in January. The Royalist successes of November and December, the ever-present <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> foreign intervention, and the burden of new taxation—which Parliament now felt compelled to impose—disheartened its supporters. Disorder broke out in London, and, while the more determined of the rebels {{began to think of}} calling in the military assistance of the Scots, the majority were for peace on any conditions.|$|E
25|$|In Arab folklore, sacred {{trees are}} haunted by jinn; sacrifices are made, and the sick who sleep beneath them receive {{prescriptions}} in their dreams. Here, as frequently elsewhere, {{it is dangerous}} to pull a bough. This <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> damaging special trees is familiar: Cato instructed the woodman to sacrifice to the male or female deity before thinning a grove, while in the Homeric poem to Aphrodite the tree nymph is wounded when the tree is injured, and dies when the trunk falls.|$|E

25|$|In 1886, on the {{conclusion}} of the Sino-French War, Li arranged a treaty with the French. Li was impressed with the necessity of strengthening the Qing Empire, and while he was Viceroy of Zhili, he raised a large well-drilled and well-armed force, and spent vast sums both in fortifying Port Arthur and the Dagu forts and in strengthening the navy. For years, he had watched the successful reforms effected in Japan and had a well-founded <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> coming into conflict with the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|A {{fraction}} of stećci (384) bear inscriptions, mostly in extinct Bosnian Cyrillic, some in Glagolitic and Latin script. The language has some archaic phrases, characterized by Ikavian while {{toward the end}} by Ijekavian yat reflex. The inscriptions can be roughly divided into those of: religious phrase, description of heroic death, information of the deceased, information of the deceased's relatives and circumstances of death, information with only personal name (sometime with smith-pupil name), moral (or religious) lesson. The last are mostly brazen reminders of wisdom and mortality, relay a <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> death, more anxiety than peace.|$|E
25|$|Against this {{background}} of dread, {{there was an}} outpouring of cinema with frightening themes, particularly in the science fiction genre. Science fiction had previously not been popular with either critics or movie audiences, but it became a viable Hollywood genre during the Cold War. In the 1950s, science fiction had two main themes: {{the invasion of the}} Earth by superior, aggressive, and frequently technologically advanced aliens; and the <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> atomic weapons, which was typically portrayed as a revolt of nature, with irradiated monsters attacking and ravaging entire cities.|$|E

25|$|The bill {{establishing}} the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities. One of Grattan's main grounds {{of opposition to}} the union had been his <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> seeing the political leadership in Ireland pass {{out of the hands}} of the landed gentry; and he prophesied that the time would come when Ireland would send to the united parliament a hundred of the greatest rascals in the kingdom. Like Flood before him, Grattan had no leaning towards democracy; and he anticipated that by the removal of the centre of political interest from Ireland the evil of absenteeism would be intensified.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, India {{signed the}} Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), stating {{that it did}} not have {{chemical}} weapons and the capacity or intent to manufacture chemical weapons. By doing this India became one of the original signatories of the CWC in 1993, and ratified it on 2 September 1996. According to India's ex-Army Chief General Sunderji, a country having the capability of making nuclear weapons does not need to have chemical weapons, since the <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> chemical weapons could be created only in those countries that do not have nuclear weapons. Others suggested that the fact that India has found chemical weapons dispensable highlighted its confidence in the conventional weapons system at its command.|$|E
25|$|The older Calvinistic {{emphasis}} on free grace was given {{new life in}} Methodist publications, preaching God's wonderful method of saving even the worst of sinners. It was viewed with suspicion and distrust by mid and late 18th century Anglican priests, since it carried with it the belief that salvation could be obtained without adherence to the moral law as delivered in the Ten Commandments. Men were not damned for the crimes they committed but for not believing in the great truths of the Gospel. If men had faith in the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, they might be under no <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> what they did, because he stood clean before the eyes of God from the day in which Christ died upon the cross.|$|E

25|$|The royal couple lived {{surrounded}} by soldiers, always in <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> a revolution. Their security was {{guaranteed by the}} Austrian troops stationed in Naples, but their expenses were a heavy burden on the state coffers and {{the main reason for}} the high public debt. On Medici’s advise, Francis and Maria Isabella, taking with them their one-year-old son the Count of Aquila, went to Milan in May 1825 in order to obtain a reduction in the occupation troops. After an agreement between Medici and the Austrian ambassador Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont, the King and Queen returned to Naples on 18 July. The Austrian troops were reduced to 12,000 beginning {{at the end of that}} year and departed in February 1827.|$|E
25|$|That {{same night}} Menéndez {{returned}} to St. Augustine; {{and when the}} event became known, there were some, even in that isolated garrison, living in constant <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> a descent by the French, who considered him cruel, an opinion which his brother-in-law, Merás, the very man who helped to kill Ribault, {{did not hesitate to}} record. And when the news eventually reached Spain, even there a vague rumor was afloat that there were those who condemned Menéndez for perpetrating the massacre against his given word. Others among the settlers thought that he had acted as a good captain, because, with their small store of provisions, they considered that there would have been an imminent danger of their perishing by hunger had their numbers been increased by the Frenchmen, even had they been Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{have made}} it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly. The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.|$|E

25|$|Much irresolution {{was caused}} by {{distrust}} of each other, arising from suspicions of treachery, {{by the absence of}} a chief and leader of the war (for their sovereign, king Stephen, encompassed by equal difficulties in the south of England, was just then unable to join them), and by their <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> encountering, with an inadequate force, so great a host However, urged by the 70-year-old Thurstan ('Lieutenant of the North' in addition to his ecclesiastical duties; Walter Espec was High Sheriff of Yorkshire), to stand and fight and if needs be die in a holy cause, they agreed to gather their forces and return to York, where they were joined by reinforcements from Nottinghamshire under William Peverel and Geoffrey Halsalin, and from Derbyshire led by Robert de Ferrers. They advanced to Thirsk, from where they sent Robert de Brus and Bernard de Balliol (recently arrived with a few mercenaries sent by King Stephen) on an embassy to David, whose army was now approaching the River Tees and North Yorkshire.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not want your brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant <b>dread</b> <b>of</b> some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E
