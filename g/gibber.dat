40|$|Gastrointestinal {{bleeding}} (<b>GIB)</b> complicating percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{results in}} high mortality, but clinical {{factors associated with}} and long-term outcomes of <b>GIB</b> are poorly understood. We sought to examine clinical and procedural factors associated with <b>GIB</b> complicating PCI. We also examined the impact of <b>GIB</b> on 30 -day mortality and 1 -year major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Patients undergoing PCI from January 2000 to January 2010 were retrospectively analyzed for the occurrence of in-hospital <b>GIB.</b> Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify predictors of in-hospital <b>GIB</b> and 30 -day mortality. Landmark analysis of patients surviving to hospital discharge was performed {{to assess the impact}} of <b>GIB</b> on 1 -year MACEs. Of 20, 621 patients who underwent PCI, 147 (0. 72 %) who developed in-hospital <b>GIB</b> were identified. Variables associated with increased risk of <b>GIB</b> included older age, shock, acute myocardial infarction, chronic renal insufficiency, lower baseline hematocrit, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; bivalirudin decreased the risk. Unadjusted 30 -day mortality rate of patients with <b>GIB</b> was 20. 5 % compared to 2. 4 % of patients without <b>GIB.</b> After multivariable adjustment, <b>GIB</b> and shock (and an interaction between the 2) were the most important correlates of 30 -day mortality. In the population surviving to discharge, however, <b>GIB</b> was not associated with adjusted mortality or MACEs. In conclusion, <b>GIB</b> complicating PCI has a dramatic impact on 30 -day mortality, and bivalirudin was associated with lower rates of <b>GIB...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{nonsense}} verse was not original to Carroll, {{who would have}} known of chapbooks such as The World Turned Upside Down and stories such as [...] "The Great Panjundrum". Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well-known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, {{some of which are}} called lying tales or lügenmärchen. Roger Lancelyn Green suggests that [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] is a parody of the old German ballad [...] "The Shepherd of the Giant Mountains" [...] in which a shepherd kills a griffin that is attacking his sheep. The ballad had been translated into English in blank verse by Carroll's cousin Menella Bute Smedley in 1846, many years before the appearance of the Alice books. Historian Sean B. Palmer suggests that Carroll was inspired by a section from Shakespeare's Hamlet, citing the lines: [...] "The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/Did squeak and <b>gibber</b> in the Roman streets" [...] from ActI, Scenei.|$|E

To analyse the importance of <b>GIB</b> we studied, retrospectively, the causes of hospitalization in 301 patients, all on HD in the same Unit in January 1990. The average age was 57. 4 +/- 14. 2 years (17 to 87), time on HD 58. 3 +/- 44. 9 months, male = 166, female = 135. Of a total of 169 hospitalizations, the infectious disease were the most frequent cause with 37 admissions (21. 9 %), followed by gastrointestinal diseases with 34 admissions (21. 1 %).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the causes of}} gastrointestinal bleeding (<b>GIB)</b> {{and its impact on}} patient and graft survival after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx), the first 1000 consecutive OLTx using tacrolimus were studied. Our patient population consisted of 834 adults. The bleeding episodes of patients with <b>GIB</b> (n= 74) were analyzed, and patients without <b>GIB</b> (n= 760) were used as controls. The mean age, gender, and United Network for Organ Sharing status were similar in both groups. Endoscopy was done in 73 patients with <b>GIB</b> and yielded a diagnosis in 60 patients (82. 2 %) : 39 with a single, and 21 with multiple <b>GIB</b> episodes. In the remaining 13 patients (17. 8 %), the bleeding source was not identified. Of 92 <b>GIB</b> episodes with endoscopic diagnoses, ulcers (n= 25) were {{the most common cause of}} bleeding, followed by enteritis (n= 24), portal hypertensive lesions (n= 15), Roux-en-Y bleeds, and other miscellaneous events (n= 28). The majority (73 %) of the <b>GIB</b> episodes occurred during the first postoperative trimester. The patient and graft survival rates were statistically lower in the <b>GIB</b> group compared with the control group. The adjusted relative risk of mortality and graft failure was increased by bleeding. In summary, the cumulative incidence of <b>GIB</b> was 8. 9 %. Endoscopy identified the source of <b>GIB</b> in most cases. Ulcers were the most common cause of <b>GIB</b> after OLTx.

Methods: In this retrospective, cohort study using administrative and clinical databases, patients experiencing <b>GIB</b> during warfarin therapy were categorized according to whether they resumed warfarin therapy after <b>GIB</b> and followed up for 90 days.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Use of dabigatran, an {{inhibitor}} of thrombin, increases risk of {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} (<b>GIB).</b> However, {{it is not}} clear whether gastroprotective agents (GPAs) prevent <b>GIB</b> in dabigatran users. We investigated the risk of <b>GIB</b> and the role of GPAs (including proton-pump inhibitors and histamine type- 2 receptor antagonists) in patients using dabigatran. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using a population-wide database managed by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Patients newly prescribed dabigatran from 2010 through 2013 were included in the analysis. Poisson regression was used to assess the risk of <b>GIB</b> in dabigatran users by incidence rate ratio (IRR), adjusted for patient characteristics, comorbidities, and concurrent medications. RESULTS: Among the 5041 patients newly prescribed dabigatran, 124 (2. 5 %) developed <b>GIB</b> during follow-up (4. 2 / 100 patient-years). The risk of <b>GIB</b> in this population increased among patients 75 y old or older (IRR, 2. 47; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 66 - 3. 68), patients with a history of peptic ulcers or <b>GIB</b> (IRR, 2. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 54 - 3. 46), and patients who used aspirin (IRR, 1. 52; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 2. 24). Concomitant use of GPAs was associated with a reduced risk of <b>GIB</b> (IRR, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 35 - 0. 77). Subcategory analysis showed that use of proton-pump inhibitors (IRR, 0. 53; 95 % CI, 0. 31 - 0. 91) or histamine type- 2 receptor antagonists (IRR, 0. 61; 95 % CI, 0. 40 - 0. 94) were associated with lower risk of <b>GIB.</b> Further analysis revealed that the risk reduction by GPAs was significant for only upper <b>GIB</b> (IRR, 0. 29; 95 % CI, 0. 15 - 0. 54) and only for patients with prior history of peptic ulcers or <b>GIB</b> (IRR, 0. 14; 95 % CI, 0. 06 - 0. 30).
