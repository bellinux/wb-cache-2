At least 12 were mounted <b>on</b> <b>railway</b> <b>carriages</b> by mid-1919; it is unclear how many more were eventually mounted. A detailed description of the railway mounting is given in Railway Artillery, Vol. I by Lt. Col. H. W. Miller. Like almost all US-made railway guns of World War I (the notable exception being the US Navy's 14"/50 caliber railway guns), these never left the US. Almost all were returned to coastal defenses after the war; however, one survived for experimental purposes at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division until it was transferred to the U.S. Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center at Fort Lee, Virginia in the 2000s.|$|R

5|$|Normandie and Languedoc {{were ordered}} on 12 December 1912, {{followed}} by Flandre and Gascogne on 30 July 1913. Béarn was ordered on 3 December; the five ships would permit {{the creation of}} two four-ship divisions with the three Bretagne-class ships then under construction. Work on the class was suspended at the outbreak of World War I, as all resources were needed for the Army. The government did not immediately mobilize for war, as they expected the conflict to be brief. The first four ships were launched {{after the start of}} the war, but only to clear the slipways for other purposes. In July 1915, the Navy determined that the ships were not a priority, and prohibited further work. Later in July, work on the ships' armament was suspended, save the guns themselves, which could be converted for use by the Army. Four of the completed 340mm guns were converted into railway guns for the French Army. Nine of the guns built for Languedoc were also mounted <b>on</b> <b>railway</b> <b>carriages</b> in 1919, {{after the end of the}} war. Several of the 138.6mm guns were also converted for service with the Army.|$|R
50|$|After the American {{entry into}} World War I on 6 April 1917, the US Army {{considered}} converting coast artillery weapons to railway mounts {{for use on}} the Western Front. Railway guns were in use by all the major belligerents in the war by that time. Among the weapons that could be spared from fixed defenses were 150 12-inch mortars, removed from 4-mortar pits. Contracts were let for mounting 91 mortars <b>on</b> <b>railway</b> <b>carriages</b> known as the M1918 <b>Carriage</b> (<b>Railway).</b> A hydropneumatic recuperator and outriggers allowed for all-around fire from the railway mounting, which weighed 88 tons. Forty-five <b>railway</b> mortar <b>carriages</b> were completed by the Morgan Engineering Company of Alliance, Ohio by 7 April 1919. All 91 contracted mortars were eventually mounted. The following footnoted article shows the firing of an M1890 mortar <b>on</b> a <b>railway</b> mounting. Since the mounting permitted all-around fire and thus tracking of a moving target, the 12-inch railway mortar (along with 8-inch guns and twelve 7-inch guns on similar carriages) was retained after World War I for future coast defense use. The Army conducted tests with railway mortars in the 1930s. Some (probably four) of the railway mortars were assigned to Battery C, 52nd Railway Artillery Battalion, and tested at the Sandy Hook Proving Ground at Fort Hancock, New Jersey and also at Fort Miles, Delaware. During World War II, a battery of four railway mortars was among the temporary harbor defenses of Grays Harbor, Washington, and emplacements for an additional battery at Cape George, Washington were constructed but never armed.|$|R
40|$|Resumé This {{thesis is}} focused on legal acts which are called {{carriage}} acts or transportation rules. Carriage acts are legal acts containing regulations of persons, luggage, objects and parcels transportation in all kind of types of domestic transportation. This text {{is divided into three}} parts which first {{is focused on}} historical development of carriage acts in our region, second part is focused on research of current forced carriage acts and third part is focused on comparison Czech and German carriage acts. First part of this text where historical development of carriage acts is examined, contains complete evolution and development of carriage acts from the very first one to the present day. The strongest emphasis is placed <b>on</b> <b>railways</b> <b>carriage</b> acts for their biggest importance of this kind of transportation in historical overview. In second part of this thesis current forced carriage acts are set in legal system and analyzed. In particular it is the Ordinance of Secretary of transportation no. 175 / 2000, Carriage act for public railway and road passenger transportation and Ordinance of government no. 1 / 2000, Carriage act for public railway cargo transportation.

Since {{the appearance of the}} book in 1941 the solution was contested by several distinguished mathematicians. The first formal proof based on the idea of Courant and Robbins was published by Ivan Polekhin in 2014. Polekhin also proved a theorem on the existence of a periodic solution of the problem provided the movement of the carriage on the line is periodic. In the present paper we slightly improve the Polekhin's theorem by lowering the regularity class of the motion and we prove a theorem on the existence of a periodic solution if the carriage moves periodically on the plane...|$|R
5000|$|Bridges Adams {{patented}} {{an improved}} carriage spring, {{which he called}} [...] "bow springs". These {{could also be used}} <b>on</b> <b>railway</b> <b>carriages,</b> and the manufacture proved profitable. The manufacture was based in the Currier Factory in Drury Lane and Parker Street, Soho. The business was carried out in the name of Samuel Adams, Bridges Adams's uncle. In 1842 the factory moved from its small premises to three acres of land adjoining the Eastern Counties Railway at Fair Field, Bow. The company now traded as Adams & Co. He founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works (...) in Bow, East London, in 1843, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and inspection trolleys. These were sold in small numbers to railways all over Britain and Ireland, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Enfield for his most important customer, the Eastern Counties Railway, with its headquarters at nearby Stratford. Dissatisfied with the scarf joints then in use for joining iron track, he invented the first railway fishplate, {{in the form of an}} unbolted wedge between adjoining chairs, in collaboration with Robert Richardson, a junior engineer under Peter Bruff on the Eastern Counties Railway. The two men patented the invention in 1847. Although the design was successful, with sales to the Eastern Counties Railway among others, financial difficulties forced Adams to relinquish the patent. This [...] "wedge" [...] version was soon overtaken by an improved, bolted design by James Samuel of the Eastern Counties Railway. He also supplied an 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway.|$|R

Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination <b>on</b> a <b>railway</b> <b>carriage,</b> the main sources agree this story {{is likely to be}} apocryphal. The origin of the Formby name is {{more likely to have been}} a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the Argyle Theatre in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star George Robey. Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.|$|R
50|$|The ex-Navy Mark VI railway gun {{was quickly}} put {{together}} {{at the start of}} World War II, to supplement the older World War I 8-inch M1888 railway gun.

The all-around rotating mount and outriggers were designed to allow the gun to track a moving target for coast defense. These guns had a very short life in Army use, entering service in February 1941 and being cut up for scrap immediately after the war. The guns were the Navy's 8-inch (203 mm)/45 caliber Mark VI, and were originally secondary armament on Virginia- and Connecticut-class battleships launched 1904-06 and scrapped in the 1920s.

5000|$|A bogie ( [...] ) is a wheeled wagon or trolley. In {{mechanics}} terms, a bogie is {{a chassis}} or framework carrying wheels, {{attached to a}} vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as <b>on</b> a <b>railway</b> <b>carriage</b> or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a caterpillar tracked vehicle. Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often jacobs bogies) under {{the connection between the}} carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using span bolsters to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.|$|R
