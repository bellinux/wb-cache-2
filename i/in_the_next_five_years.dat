5|$|Following No Reservations, Zeta-Jones {{significantly}} decreased her workload <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> She instead {{chose to}} focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions.

5|$|He was a Test {{selector}} for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|E
