50|$|In {{accordance}} to the AMF General Regulation, Paris-based Oddo Corporate Finance {{launched on}} SunGard's behalf an all-cash tender offer {{for the remainder}} of GL Trade's share capital at the original price of EUR 41.70 per share. The price per share did not reflect the overall decay of worldwide corporate's values according to the 2008 Financial Crisis impact. Thus the total deal value of nearly USD 1 Billion was considered to be financially hazardous, given the mere fact that GL Trade reported revenues of <b>EUR</b> 203 <b>Million</b> and an <b>EBITDA</b> of <b>EUR</b> 26 <b>Million</b> (fiscal year 2007).|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{trade between}} Kenya and Slovakia was worth KES. 632 <b>million</b> (<b>EUR.</b> 5.84 <b>million).</b> Kenya {{exported}} goods worth KES. 65.99 <b>million</b> (<b>EUR.</b> 0.61 <b>million)</b> to Slovakia and imported goods worth KES. 570 <b>million</b> (<b>EUR.</b> 5.27 <b>million)</b> from Slovakia.|$|R

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planning horizon, no surpluses from operations are available to the investor. Putting the new distribution location in Volketswil into operation requires <b>EUR</b> 1.175 <b>million</b> (<b>EUR</b> 1 <b>million</b> for opening + EUR 0.175 million for making related capacities available). Furthermore, initial capacity changes (capacity expansions in Lahr and Hemer that require <b>EUR</b> 4 <b>million</b> in each year of the investor’s engagement, and can be balanced with annual cash inflows of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million</b> resulting from capacity downsizing at the production location in Porta Westfalica until {{the beginning}} of 2010) need to be considered. As financing through two credits (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 1 <b>million,</b> which is equal to the credit limit of this period) is not sufficient for the purposes mentioned above, the investor is advised to provide additional funds of <b>EUR</b> 2.175 <b>million</b> to the company to obtain increasing FTEs in the future. The credits must be repaid after 2  years (<b>EUR</b> 0.25 <b>million)</b> and 3  years (<b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million),</b> respectively. After the first period (i.e., at {{the beginning of}} the year 2009), the net operating profit after taxes is <b>EUR</b> 60.447 <b>million.</b> It is adjusted for regular payments of the aforementioned ongoing capacity changes (balanced to cash outflows of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million).</b> Taking into account two new credits (<b>EUR</b> 0.25 <b>million</b> for 1  year and <b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million</b> for 2  years, interest rates contain risk premium due to the current total debt of <b>EUR</b> 2 <b>million),</b> a cash outflow to the investor of <b>EUR</b> 59.447 <b>million</b> is possible. After the second time period (i.e., at {{the beginning of the}} year 2010) the tax shield becomes relevant for determining the net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 61.994 <b>million,</b> as interests of <b>EUR</b> 0.058 <b>million</b> must be paid for two expiring loans (repayment amount of <b>EUR</b> 0.5 <b>million).</b> Simultaneously, a new loan (credit amount of <b>EUR</b> 0.75 <b>million,</b> interest rate 2  % p.a. + risk premium 7.5  % p.a. due to a current total debt of <b>EUR</b> 2.25 <b>million</b> and the debt limit of <b>EUR</b> 3 <b>million)</b> is taken out. The FTE of <b>EUR</b> 60.244 <b>million</b> results. After the following time period, the engagement of the investor ends. Last decisions on the adjustment of the network structure are possible at this point in time (end of the year 2010). In particular, there are cash inflows of <b>EUR</b> 2.7 <b>million</b> resulting from the liquidation of the production location in Porta Westfalica. As the rest of the configuration remains untouched (i.e., there are no further closings of locations), ongoing operations are ensured after the investor’s engagement. Three outstanding loans (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 2.25 <b>million)</b> are repaid, the related interests (summed up to <b>EUR</b> 0.319 <b>million)</b> are relevant for the calculation of the tax shield. Due to a net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 57.735 <b>million,</b> a last cash outflow to the investor of <b>EUR</b> 54.185 <b>million</b> is possible. Using the given network structure that would be available to the new holders after the investor’s engagement, a net operating profit after taxes of <b>EUR</b> 62.125 <b>million</b> could be generated per year. As the latter is assumed to be a perpetuity, a residual value of <b>EUR</b> 460.19 <b>million</b> (valid at the end of the year 2010) can be calculated.|$|R
