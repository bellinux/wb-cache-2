25|$|When Stuart first {{followed}} Ritchie {{into his}} studio {{and watched him}} pull a printed page from his 1839 English iron Albion hand press, she wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> After studying typesetting at the Women’s Workshop in Los Angeles, Stuart bought her own hand press, a Vandercook SP15 and established her own private press, Imprenta Glorias.|$|E
25|$|The most shocking, frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E

50|$|Note: Club(s) {{represents}} all {{the clubs}} that players played {{in at the}} time they <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> in the Under-21s.|$|R
50|$|Sturges {{decided to}} {{eliminate}} this dialogue, since although {{it made a}} point which Sturges indeed wished to make, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> well.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1954, visiting Paris, Stuart {{first saw}} the Impressionist {{paintings}} at the Jeu de Paume museum. As when she first saw découpage, Stuart wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> The Sheekmans {{were on their way}} to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid no taxes on income earned during the residency. Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play. For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.|$|E
2500|$|Some animals {{deliberately}} autohaemorrhage or squirt {{blood as}} a defense mechanism. Armored crickets, which are native to Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana, drive away predators by spewing vomit and spurting hemolymph (the mollusk and arthropod equivalent of blood) from under their legs and through slits in their exoskeleton. Katydids <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>too,</b> and in Germany the species has acquired the nickname [...] "Blutspritzer", or [...] "blood squirter". The regal horned lizard, too, uses the blood-spewing tactic, shooting the substance from a pocket near its eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Greg Graffin {{called his}} {{influences}} [...] "pop-sounding rock tunes {{that were not}} necessarily commercial." [...] Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's lyrical style. [...] "He wrote some intelligent stuff, and didn't {{shy away from the}} vocabulary, which I thought was cool." [...] In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents, {{in the way that they}} used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, [...] "Seeing The Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> because look, they're doing it." ...|$|E
3000|$|... [Sigh (a sign {{of rising}} {{unconscious}} anxiety)] Well, I’ve {{thought to myself}} {{that some of those}} guys should be out there <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't they, just?" [...] {{said the}} Governor. [...] "They get made Cabinet Ministers for <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b> I went home last year. I know." ...|$|R
60|$|If he {{had known}} the {{sharpness}} of the pain he caused the patient heart, in speaking thus! While <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> {{with the purpose of}} easing and serving her.|$|R
2500|$|These circumstances, which {{applied to}} the enemy as well, don't explain the Castilian behaviour: the chronicles of both sides show that the Prince's battle kept {{increasing}} (making a [...] "gross battle"), because towards it moved many defeated and fugitives from the Royal Battle and also the Prince's men {{coming back from the}} enemy's chase, and even contingents of soldiers from [...] Toro, which crossed the battlefield to reinforce the Prince. Thus, if all these men could reach the Prince, the Castilians could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>too,</b> especially because the two battles (the Portuguese and the Castilian) were so proximal that the men could listen to each other: [...] "(...) being so close to each other [...] that they could hear what they talked about (...)" [...] (Garcia de Resende).|$|E
6000|$|The crowd {{received}} this little speech in silence. One or two said, in low voices: [...] "That's business. She'll <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> if anyone can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{not always}} kissing, old chap. It's only now and then, and when you're bigger you'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b> Your father meant it's {{not good for}} little boys.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Indeed they are—I educated them myself,” {{answered}} the other man. “I spent months in <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> They are the best-educated white mice in the United States,” he added, proudly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't do any good, but it's {{what a lot}} of {{them have}} done because they felt like <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> and Murrey will feel like <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b> That is where I foresee trouble and disagreement." ...|$|R
50|$|The song {{itself is}} a ballad, with Vissi lamenting {{the fact that she}} {{realised}} the mistake she had done of having a relationship with a person, but she <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> late.|$|R
60|$|And he {{made them}} <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> He told them that {{that sort of thing}} was half the fun of a picnic. They said it was very interesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not always}} kissing, old chap. It's only now and then, and when you're bigger you'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>too.</b> Your father meant it's {{not good for}} little boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe you'll get off easy, if {{you turn}} state's evidence," [...] {{said one of the}} men present. [...] "You'd better <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> for this is a serious case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> {{in such a}} cunning wise, [...] That {{he could}} neither 'scape nor ward off doom. [...] I staked around his steps an endless net, [...] As for the fishes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' ye <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> {{without an}} aim, for you had both eyes tight shut at the time," [...] remarked Fergus. [...] "Iss {{that the way}} they teach ye to shoot at sea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR COLFORD,--This is {{the only}} decent thing I can <b>do.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>too</b> damned unfair to her. It's only another jump. A pistol keeps faith. Look after her, Colford--my love to her, and you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawson {{put in a}} word. [...] "He'll <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> if {{the cattle}} {{interest}} can influence the Secretary. Don't tell us any more than is proper, Captain, but--how do you find his accounts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Studying Milt's shadowed face, Claire considered, [...] "He could <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> Sitting {{there at}} the wheel, taking danger and good road with the same steadiness. Oh, he's--well, anyway, he's a dear boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{they will}} <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> You'll see," [...] was Fred's comment. [...] "They are as mad as hornets, {{and they will}} do {{everything}} they can think of to make trouble for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Called to {{a fellow}} he had there with a knife in his hand, cutting leather, to turn {{me out of the}} shop. And the man would have <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> if I hadn't gone." ...|$|R
60|$|VIOLET. [not to be silenced] It is I and not you {{who suffer}} by this concealment; and as to facing a {{struggle}} and poverty {{and all that}} sort of thing I simply will not <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>too</b> silly.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{tell you}} <b>it's</b> <b>too</b> tight. My arm is {{swelling}} {{and the pain}} is intense. It can't be right to leave it so. Dr. Scott dressed it in a hurry and <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> tight. Common sense will tell you that," [...] said Coventry impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now you get along," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "You pop off. And I'm {{going to watch}} you <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> And, if I find you sneakin' off to the Three Pigeons [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll find it well to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too.</b> Work, and don't drink. You hardly think, I suppose, that if I {{had married}} your {{daughter}} I should have found myself obliged {{to support you}} in idleness?" ...|$|E
60|$|His {{little boy}} was in {{profound}} trouble. He {{felt he had}} to speak very seriously to his father, and as he was a kindly little boy {{he did not want to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>too</b> harshly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{blame him}} for what he done--I'd have <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> if I'd been him. But say, I felt kind of bad when I heard it, knowing about the kid, and all. I had to bring something--" ...|$|R
60|$|That night, poor Mrs Denman, in a {{condition}} of mind that is utterly indescribable, because inconceivable, went through {{the whole of the}} dreadful processes which Joe had described; and <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> with miraculous presence of mind and energy--in her dreams.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Tom <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> if you remember. So did Gussie. So did Tuppy. So, probably, though I have no data, did Anatole, and I wouldn't put it {{past the}} Bassett. And Aunt Dahlia, I have no doubt, would have <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> <b>too,</b> but for the risk of disarranging the {{carefully}} fixed coiffure.|$|R
