40|$|The {{author of}} the {{monograph}} “Cytolytic Immune Lymphocytes [...] . ” (published in 2008 by Schenk Buchverlag Campus Dialog, Budapest, Passau, Pécs) proposed several research projects and described certain clinical events that require further elaboration and documentation. In this article the author provides what is required and has since become available. The first subject matter in question concerns the fusogenic viruses. The ancient fusogenic viruses might have created the first eukaryotic cell(s) by uniting archaeabacterial and prokaryotic/protobacterial protospheroplasts. Extant fusogenic viruses either produce tumor cell syncytia and lyse them, thus practicing viral oncolysis. Or, create chimaeric fusion products, the socalled “natural hybridomas”, of lymphoma cells exhibiting transmembrane budding of retrovirus particles or envelope proteins, and anti-viral specific antibody-producing plasma cells. The second topic concerns the horizontal-lateral mode of acquisition of those genes, which were “present in the waiting” in the amphioxus, sea urchin, and the agnathans, and met in the primitive gnatostomata sharks to encode in unison the entire adaptive immune system. The consensus of opinion is such that these genes derived from newly acquired transposons/retrotransposons. The author {{points out that the}} extant Epstein-Barr virus harbors genes displaying sequence homology with those genes from the sharks up to mammals that regulate the somatic hypermutation of specific antibody production. The author proposes that an ancient herpesvirus might have propagated the V(D) J and RAG genes from sea urchins to sharks. The third area is that of lymphocytes cytotoxic/cytolytic to virally infected or malignantly transformed host cells. This discovery led to the adoptive <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> therapy of tumors. Installed in the adaptive immune system are regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells for he protection of “self”. Tumor cells masquerading as “self” are protected by these cells from attacks launched by immune T cells. The author supports the replacement of IL- 2 by IL- 15, inasmuch as IL- 2 stimulates not only immune T cells, but also regulatory T cells expressing the CD 25 IL- 2 receptor. The administration of low dose whole body radiotherapy prior to <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> therapy increases the efficacy of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> therapy. The author observed this phenomenon in the mid- 1960 s. The explanation of this phenomenon revealed itself just recently. In pre-irradiated hosts the intestinal wall becomes permeable to the gut flora; the intestinal bacteria activate the entire innate immune system in the mesenteric lymph nodes and a rapid activation of the adaptive immune faculties follows...|$|E

Although the <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> restricted principally the multiplication of homologous organisms, partial protection, expressed against the heterologous organism, was found. This was true for either parasite with intact lymphocytes or their supernatants. Exposure of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to antigen for 18 to 24 h and treatment of kidney cells with supernatant fluids for 18 to 24 h were required for maximal protection. The specific protective mediator in supernatants of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was characterized by dialysis as having a molecular weight between 3, 000 and 12, 000 and was found in the 3, 000 to 5, 000 peak after Sephadex G- 50 chromatography.

In vitro production of lymphokines from toxoplasma <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was first detected 7 to 10 days after vaccination of hamsters. At about the same time, hamsters began to resist challenge infection with the pathogenic RH strain of T. gondii and were able to prevent its multiplication in lungs, liver, spleen, and the subcutaneous infection site.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{specific}} antigen {{on the development}} of physical interactions between lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) obtained from animals which had been immunized to that antigen and macrophages was examined. We found that the presence of antigen, either limited to the macrophage () or free in the medium, profoundly increased the degree of) or free in the medium, profoundly increased the degree of Mphi-LNL interaction observed. This enhanced interaction was dependent on the coincidence in the cultures of Mphi bearing antigen and LNL from animals specifically immunized to that antigen. Although antigen-independent interactions developed equally well between syngeneic and allogeneic combinations of lymphocytes and macrophages, antigen mediated interactions required that macrophages and lymphocytes be syngeneic. Prolongation of antigen- mediated Mphi-LNL interactions resulted in the induction of LNL DNA synthesis, initially involving those lymphocytes physically associated with antigen-bearing Mphi. These studies are interpreted to indicate that physical interaction between <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and antigen- bearing Mphi represents a morphological correlate of the functional activation of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Further, it is suggested that the physical events involved in lymphocyte proliferation may proceed sequentially from antigen-independent reversible binding of lymphocytes by macrophages to prolonged antigen-stabilized interaction eventuating in the triggering of specifically <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using {{guinea pigs}} of strains 2 and 13 and their F 1 hybrids as {{experimental}} subjects, various lines of evidence {{have been obtained}} that in this species, as in all others tested, the only significant cellular antigens with which donor lymphocytes engage when normal and <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> reactions are incited are radiosensitive leukocytes. Constitutive cells of the skin are unimportant. (a) The intensities of these reactions in irradiated subjects are dependent upon the peripheral leukocyte concentration. When this falls below a certain threshold no reactions are incitable. (b) Highly leukopenic animals are capable of developing <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> transfer (ILT) reactions if normal lymphoid cells of their own genetic constitution are mixed with the putative attacking donor cells, as "supplementing antigen," before inoculation. (c) Radiation-chimeric strain 13 animals having F 1 hybrid leukocytes in their bloodstream give typical ILT reactions when challenged intradermally with strain 13 anti- 2 node cells. Exposure of strain 2 animals to 600 R does not prevent their becoming actively immunized if, 24 hr later, they are injected intradermally with strain 13 lymphocytes. However, this sensitization, revealed by the host's capacity to give delayed hypersensitivity reactions, wanes as leukopenia progresses. On {{the basis of this}} and other findings it is argued that the flare-up stage of the NLT reaction in preirradiated hosts is mainly an expression of host sensitivity against the transferred alien cells. Two unexpected observations {{have been made in the}} course of this study: (a) F 1 hybrid animals developed what appeared to be a strong delayed hypersensitivity after intradermal inoculation with parental strain lymphoid cells or antigenic extracts prepared from them. (b) If strain 13 guinea pigs which had been sensitized against strain 2 tissue antigens by intradermal injection of lymphocytes 7 days beforehand were inoculated intravenously with strain 2 antigenic extract a significant proportion of the animals developed severe delayed necrotizing reactions, recall flares, at some or all of the healed skin inoculation sites...|$|E

40|$|NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT This study {{involves}} the use of novel methods to treat patients with advanced cancer by manipulation of their immune system. Based on extensive animal studies, we know that the immune system has the potential to recognize tumor cells as being foreign to the body and destroy them. The critical component of the immune system which appears {{to be involved in the}} rejection of tumors are lymphocytes. The ability to generate these lymphocytes in the laboratory would be useful for potential therapy of cancer. This approach has been called adoptive immunotherapy and {{involves the}} infusion of cancer reactive lymphocytes into patients in order to cause tumor shrinkage. Unfortunately, the generation of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> which can reject human cancers has been extremely difficult. One possible reason why this problem exists is that the foreign proteins present on human tumor cells are very weak in their ability to stimulate the immune system to react against them. Based on our animal studies, we have devised an approach to artificially stimulate immune cells that may be used for the treatment of human tumors that under normal circumstances would not occur. This involves a two-step process. The first step requires vaccination of the patient with their own tumor cells which have previously been removed and genetically engineered to secrete an immune factor called GM-CSF. The tumor cells are irradiated prior to injection into the skin in order to prevent outgrowth of tumor at the site. It has been found in animal studies that the production of GM-CSF by the gene-modified tumor cells promotes an immune response in lymph nodes near the vaccination site. Lymph nodes are small glands of the <b>immune</b> system where <b>lymphocytes</b> congregate. The lymph nodes adjacent to the vaccination sites will be surgically removed approximately 7 to 10 days later and taken to the laboratory for further processing. In the laboratory, cells from the lymph nodes will be stimulated and grown in special flasks by methods we have previously described for a 2 to 3 week period in order to generate a large number of <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These lymphocytes will be collected and infused back into the patient along with the administration of interleukin- 2, another immune protein. The interleukin- 2 has been found to promote the antitumor effect of the <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in cancer patients. This clinical study proposes to address several important questions. These questions include: 1) Can this clinical treatment program be performed as described and what are its side-effects, 2) What antitumor response can be seen with this treatment, and 3) What is the immunological function of the <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> as assessed by laboratory tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} {{cryptococcosis}} was developed using intraperitoneal infections of guinea pigs. This model shared characteristics with cryptococcosis in humans {{and was used}} to {{study the effects of}} immunosuppression and immunostimulation on cryptococcosis. Female guniea pigs survived longer than males; perphaps this was related to a greater capacity of their monocytes to kill cryptococci. A brief course of cortisone shortened survival of females and resulted in depressed immune and inflammatory responses, which persisted long after cortisone was stopped. Stimulation of the immune response by treatment with cryptococci in Freund complete adjuvant improved survival in males. Preliminary studies indicated the usefulness of this model for the study of other potential immunostimulants, including <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> transfer factor prepared from <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and levamisole. Overall, long-term survivors appeared to clear disseminated cryptococci from extraperitoneal sites including brain, rather than prevent dissemination of cryptococci from the peritoneal cavity.

Comparisons of immune histiocytes and <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> showed that the former cells were more efficient; this was indicated by (a) the smaller numbers of immune histiocytes needed for passive transfer, (b) the longer duration of cellular resistance in recipients given histiocytes than in those given lymphocytes, (c) the greater capacity of histiocytes to effect serial passive transfer, and (d) the ability of histiocytic but not lymphocytic lysates to transfer cellular resistance.

40|$|After {{the initial}} {{discovery}} and careful analysis of both normal and <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> transfer reactions (NLT and ILT reactions) l in guinea pigs (1 - 4), these cutaneous manifestations of transplantation immunity {{have been studied}} {{in a variety of}} species including dogs (5), rabbits (6, 7), hamsters (8), rats (9), mice (10), and men (11). They have been employed as a means of tissue matching, elucidation of the mode of action of immunosuppressive agents, and of the modus operandi of homograft and graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions. All workers are agreed that transfer reactions are initially of the local GVH type though there are good grounds for belief that, in appropriate genetic contexts, hostversus-graft reactivity, i. e. "direct hypersensitivity reactions " (3), may intervene and complicate the situation. Various findings have established that in mice, rats, and hamsters the principal host target cells in these reactions, as in other local as well as in systemic forms of GVH reactivity, are radiosensitive cells of hematologic origin, probably lymphocytes, rather than fixed or constitutive cells of particular nonlymphohematopoietic tissues and organs where these reactions are made to tak...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} refractory state, one sequela {{of acute}} graft-versus-host disease, {{has been studied}} in adult (CB x MHA) F 1 hybrid Syrian hamsters inoculated with sublethal numbers of MHA-anti-CB lymphoid cells. Intracutaneous challenge of these animals with 200 million MHA-anti-CB lymphoid cells after the acute syndrome subsided failed to evoke epidermal necrolysis, whereas a similar challenge administered to normal F 1 recipients invariably resulted in lethal epidermolysis. Moreover, the gradual attrition of lymphatic tissues in these hosts and their fading capacity to display adequately <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> transfer reactions in the skin coincided with increasing evidence of host refractoriness, suggesting a causal interrelationship. It was possible to circumvent refractoriness by challenging these animals intracutaneously with MHA-anti-CB cells if: (a) the hosts had been lethally irradiated and reconstituted with F 1 hematopoietic cells, or (b) the intracutaneous inocula contained admixed F 1 lymphoid cells. This evidence provides additional support for the hypothesis that in GVH disease donor lymphocytes attack primarily host lymphoid cells bearing offending homologous antigens. The GVH process can continue so long as these lymphocyte-bound antigens persist within the host, and will abate only as the aggregate host lymphatic mass is effectively destroyed (hamsters) or its antigenic determinants are masked by isoantibodies (rats, mice, man?).

Moreover, hamsters have proven to be particularly useful for the study of transplantation immunity as it is expressed in delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (2, 3). During a series of experiments in which normal and <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> transfer reactions were being analyzed in hamsters, it was observed that F 1 hybrid subjects that had received intracutaneous inoculations of parental strain lymphoid cells came down with an acute severe cutaneous inflammatory disease.

However, after exogenous adrenaline a considerably increased release of both antigen-binding and antibody-forming cells occurred during a longer period of the immune response. Thus, adrenaline caused an enormous release of PFC from the spleen into the blood on day 4 of the secondary immune response, resulting in a diminished number of PFC remaining in the spleen after the treatment.

These protective cells realized their full immunological potential only in recipients that shared histocompatibility-gene-coded structures with the <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> donors. The above findings accord with the view that immunity to L. monocytogenes is mediated in rats by activated T cells which are formed as part of the animal's cell-mediated response to infection. Although Listeria-protective lymphocytes concentrate in the nonadherent, T-cell-enriched fraction, it was consistently observed that the adherent, B-cell-enriched fractions of immune donor thoracic duct lymphocytes also could transfer a low level of antimicrobial resistance. This immunity was restricted in allogeneic recipients, a finding which implies that the protection afforded by the adherent population is related to its content of T cells. Nonadherent S-phase lymphoblasts moved in substantial numbers from the blood into peritoneal inflammatory exudates induced by L. monocytogenes. The above finding encourages the belief that recently activated T cells realize their protective function locally in centers of infection where they have secondary effects on macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori are the causative {{agents of}} lymphatic hiariasis in Indonesia, {{but in some}} endemic areas, Brugia malayi is the most {{commonly}} found,Diagnosis of hiariasis is normally based on clinical and parasitological examinations, but both have limitations. Therefore now the immunological examination {{plays an important role}} in the diagnosis of filariasis. The discovery of monoclonal antibodies recently may probably give a firm scientific basis in immunology and add a new dimension to the efforts of developing a specific and sensitive immunological test for various stages of filarial infection. In this study, the production of hybridoma cells to develop monoclonal antibodies against B. malayi integrated a number of techniques: preparations of B. malayi surface antigen, <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> cells, NSI myeloma cells and macrophage feeder layers, and a fusion of immune lymphocytes with myeloma cells. The results of this study can be concluded in three points: Protein analysis of the surface antigen was examined by Biureet and SDS-PAGE. A total of fourteen examinations were conducted by using 4000 L 3 for each experiment. Three were not detected by Biureet method, but showed five protein fractions by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration of the surface L 3 was varied from 85. 0 /µg/ml to 769. 23 /µg/ml, with an average of 297. 04 /µg/ml. The immunoreactivifies of Balb/c mice antibodies to B. malayi L 3 surface antigen were tested by ELISA and showed a gradual increase after four times immunizations at two weeks interval. The optical density (OD) after four times immunizations was varied from 0. 363 to 0. 878 each mouse, where as the positive control sera OD was 0. 570. Hybridization using immune lymphocytes against B. malayi L 3 surface antigen with myeloma cells yielded 60. 41 % hybrid cells and none of them produced monoclonal antibodies tested of ELISA. </ol...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{immunobiology}} of cytotoxic thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes (CTL) 1 have provided detailed information on both the induction and detection of CTL activity directed against alloantigen-bearing target cells (1). These studies have depended heavily {{on the availability of}} rapid cytolytic assays which involve the release of radioactive mCr from isotopically labeled target cells. While these methods have been employed to derive relative estimates of cytotoxic potency of various <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> populations, this assay as currently used does not provide direct estimates of the absolute frequency of CTL in such populations. In a previous study the frequency of killer cells in a population of lymphocytes from the draining lymph nodes of immunized animals was estimated to be approximately 1 - 2 %. This figure was based on limiting dilution of immune lymphocytes and analysis of target cell survival with an electronic particle counter (2). There were certain weaknesses in that study: (a) it involved relatively long assay periods (48 h), making it difficult to rule out that new killer cells were generated in the cultures; (b) the assumption that a killer cell could affect only a single target cell, an assumption which if not valid leads to erroneously high estimates of CTL frequency; and (c) it could not be determined at the time whether killer cells were exclusively of thymic origin. In the present study, we describe another procedure which combines limiting dilution and '~'Cr release for deriving a minimal estimate of the absolute frequency of CTL generated in mouse lymphocyte populations activated to alloantigens of the major histocompatibility complex in bulk mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), some details of the specificity of CTL, as well as an estimate of the number of target cells killed by a single CTL...|$|E
40|$|The {{multiplication}} of Toxoplasma gondii was quantitated {{in human}} monocytes in vitro by phase-contrast microscopy. Toxoplasma multiplication was identical in monocytes from subjects byt was significantly inhibited in cells from both sources if the monocytes were preincubated with <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and toxoplasma monocytes were preincubated with <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and toxoplasma antigen. Supernates prepared from toxoplasma-immune lymphocytes incubated with toxoplasma antigen were also effective in inducing in monocytes {{the capacity to}} inhibit toxoplasma multiplication. Supernative acitivty was evident after lymphocytes and antigen were incubated {{for as little as}} 15 min. The instruction of monocytes was also repid and reversible. Monocytes were fully induced to inhibit toxoplasma multiplication after a 2 h exposure to an active supernate, but they lost their inhibitory capacity on culture in vitro for 48 h in the absece of immune cells or their products. The lymphocytes particupating in the monocyte induction were identified as t cells. The in vitro stimulation of monocytes appeared to exhibit some specificity, since no inhibition of toxopreotein derivative and lymphocytes from tuberculin-positive subjects, concanavalin a-stimulated lymphocytes, or their supermates. Supernates which induced monocytes to inhibit toxoplasma multiplication did not influence parasite growth in HeLa cells...|$|R

40|$|Culture supernatants of spleen or thymus {{cells from}} BALB/c mice bearing transplanted, syngeneic, methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas {{suppress}} T lymphocyte-mediated lysis of {{cells from the}} tumor borne by the donor of the spleen or thymus cells. On this basis, we hybridized thymus cells from mice bearing sarcoma MCA- 1490 with cells from the T lymphoma BW 5147. The hybrids (hybridomas) formed were tested for production of factors that could suppress T lymphocyte-mediated lysis of MCA- 1490 cells. One hybridoma, and a clone derived from it, produced factors that suppressed the lysis of MCA- 1490 cells in vitro. In addition, these factors enhanced the growth of MCA- 1490 in immune mice and prevented the destruction of MCA- 1490 cells by <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in tumor neutralization (Winn) assays. In vitro lysis of cells from another MCA-induced sarcoma by <b>immune</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was not suppressed. The suppressor factors {{did not affect the}} proliferative response of BALB/c lymphocytes to mitogens or the generation of a cytotoxic response to C 57 BL/ 6 alloantigens. Neither did they inhibit the generation of primary or secondary cytotoxic responses to murine leukemia virus-related antigens present on a BALB/c lymphoma line, LSTRA. Although our findings suggest that these suppressor factors are specific for MCA- 1490, their specificity for antigens restricted to this tumor needs further definition...|$|R
