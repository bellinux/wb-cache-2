5|$|Hibernian manager Pat Fenlon {{received}} a four-match ban for {{being sent to}} the stands during the match. He later described the result as a 'disaster' and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to address some of the problems highlighted in the Hibs team during his summer rebuilding of the squad.|$|E
5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up so that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able}} to pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Garikapati Varalakshmi {{were chosen}} {{as one of}} the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play {{harmonium}} and gave him a few music lessons so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> believable in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Dr. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend.|$|E
5|$|When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 {{video of}} himself making 45 of 50 three point shots, Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later. On April 24, 2013, he posted {{a video of}} himself making 70 of 76 three {{pointers}} in five minutes, and 8 hours later, Stephen Curry challenged him, via Twitter, to a three-point shooting contest. Curry had set the National Basketball Association single-season three pointers made record one week earlier. The following morning ESPN retweeted the video and noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row. A few hours later, when Stauskas woke up, he said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> forward to such a contest. Soon Stauskas and Curry's representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN, but the contest {{would have been in}} violation of NCAA rules against competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge spent 1917 and 1918 {{with the}} Chicago Cubs, {{serving in the}} bullpen. In 1917 Aldridge played in thirty games, winning six games and losing six, with a 3.12 earned run average and two saves. In 1918 he played only three games, {{pitching}} only twelve innings, before joining the United States Navy during {{the final year of}} World War I. After returning from the war, he played for the Los Angeles Angels, an affiliate of the Cubs, in the Pacific Coast League. Aldridge returned to the Cubs for the 1922 season. He played the next three years for Chicago, with consistent performances. In 1922, 1923 and 1924 he played 36, 30 and 32 games respectively, with 16, 16 and 15 wins in the three seasons, with respective earned run averages of 3.52, 3.48 and 3.50. During this time his son Vic Aldridge, Jr. served unofficially as the Cubs batboy and even had a uniform donated by Mordecai Brown so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> the part. In 1923 he was ejected from a game.|$|E

5|$|Modell said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> {{outside the}} Browns {{organization}} {{for a new}} coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours talking and watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E

25|$|In April 1917, when Lenin {{passed through}} Stockholm on his journey from exile in Switzerland home to Petrograd, Ture Nerman {{was one of}} those who greeted Lenin and took care of him while there.

25|$|The {{congestion}} charge remained an issue during the {{run up to}} the 2008 mayoral election. Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party candidate said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at a graduated charging scheme, would consult on whether {{to reduce the size}} of the charging zone and would not introduce the proposed emissions based charging system. Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat candidate, suggested exempting delivery vehicles from the charge.

Park won three gold medals, all in freestyle events: 200-, 400- and 1500- meter. Moreover, his winning time of Men's 1500 metre freestyle broke the Asian record set by Chinese Zhang Lin in 2009. In the FINA Official Feature Interview, Park said that his recent performances made him much more self-confident, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> forward to 2020 Tokyo Olympics.|$|E

On 1 August, it was confirmed that Messina was admitted to Serie D. On November 2008, the Court of Messina declared the club to be bankrupt and appointed a trustee to start a search for potential investors.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 {{season was}} {{a mixture of}} success and {{disappointment}} for Williams. While Rosberg managed to obtain 2 podiums in Australia and Singapore, the team struggled at circuits with high-speed corners. The fact that the team {{was one of the first}} to switch development to their 2009 car (when new regulations came in) also hindered their season, and Williams finished a disappointing 8th in the Constructors' Championship. Rosberg stated that unless the team was more competitive in the near future, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to drive elsewhere. Williams retained Rosberg and Nakajima for the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the news}} {{that he had been}} made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both {{outgoing}} captains but announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to captain the team in his own style. He scored a century in his debut match as captain in the dead rubber fourth Test, and went on to defeat South Africa 4–0 in the ODI matches. In that series he made 90 not out and got 2–22 with the ball. In the fourth ODI, another dead rubber as England were 3–0 up, he hit a quick 40 to guide England to victory.|$|E

25|$|On January 24, his {{nomination}} was voted {{out of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard right conservative in the mold of a Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. On the abortion issue, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at that {{with an open mind}} but would not state how he would rule on Roe v. Wade if that issue were to come up before the court. Some pro-life activists, however, claim Alito's confirmation as a victory for their cause.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Portland and the Portland City Council held {{meetings}} in 1935 {{to investigate a}} possible renovation of the Swan Island Municipal Airport. They determined {{that it would not}} be cost effective to rebuild the airport to accommodate larger aircraft. By 1936, citizens were petitioning the city council to fund a larger airport at a higher elevation. I. E. Oakes, the Works Progress Administration director for Portland announced in 1937 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to secure US$627,781 (US$ adjusted for inflation) in funds from the federal government to build a new runway to accommodate large airlines. However, the federal government condemned the site and offered up funds to build a new airport.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2008, the BBC {{wrote that}} Hobbs was indecisive {{about whether to}} fight for first team {{opportunities}} in Liverpool or to join another club for more playing opportunities. Hobbs said wherever he went, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> to play first team football. On 25 May, Hobbs signed for League One club Leicester City on a season-long loan deal. On joining the club, {{he said he wanted}} to help Leicester win promotion to the Championship. He made his debut for the club in a pre-season match against Kettering Town, playing 80 minutes of a 4–1 victory. His debut came on 9 August in a 2–0 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Aleksander Tunchev. Hobbs scored his first goal on 24 January 2009, scoring the last goal in a 4–2 victory over Huddersfield Town. In February 2009, he was red carded in a match against Bristol Rovers for fouling Darryl Duffy. However, the resultant penalty shot by Rickie Lambert was saved by Mark Bunn. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson commented that the decision was unfortunate, as he believed the foul was not intentional. In his first season with the club, besides winning the League One and winning promotion to the Championship, Hobbs was also included in the PFA Team of the Year. He was also voted as the Young Player of the year, as he made 44 appearances, where his team conceded 37 goals.|$|E
