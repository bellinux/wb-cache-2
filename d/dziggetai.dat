40|$|The {{history of}} the {{discovery}} and {{the exploration of the}} hemione populations (Equus hemionus PALLAS) from Central Asia (Mongolia, northwest China, northeast Tibet, Kazakhstan, and Russian Siberia) from the 13 th century to approximately 1950 are compiled with the aim to provide materials for a taxonomic and population genetic revision of the dziggetais. Data on their phenotypic differentiation, historical distribution status, and their husbandry history in European zoological gardens, are reviewed, as is the gradual emergence of concepts of how to identify and to classify these populations. Hemiones were an important historical case in the discussion of how to represent the geographical-genetic diversity contained in a large mammal species from a geographically continuous range by taxonomic nomenclature best. The numerous opinions published about this Formenkreis reflect various contemporary concepts of zoological systematics in different periods of its development. In particular the existence and the nature of (transitory?) contact populations between named taxa needs attention, in order to demonstrate the ability of the ternary nomenclature to represent such a Formenkreis. The historical evidence permits the inference of hypotheses for taxonomic and population genetic work. In recent historical times Transbaikalian Siberia has been visited seasonally by dziggetais from Mongolia. For this reason alone the subspecies Equus hemionus hemionus PALLAS, based on a type specimen from Dahuria, comprises the source herds of Gobi dziggetais from south Mongolia too. E. h. bedfordi MATSCHIE is a junior synonym of this same taxon. The genetic introgression of the Central Asian dziggetais from Dzungaria, southwest Siberia, and perhaps northwest Mongolia, by Middle Asian kulans (or the reverse introgression from the dziggetas into the kulans) is assumed, but it has been documented insufficiently. The name E. h. castaneus (LYDEKKER) had been based on the painting of a single zoo animal of doubtfully correct origin, and it cannot be employed until the mysteries around the identity of its type specimen have been clarified. A few hints concerning the possible contact and the (historical) exchange between <b>dziggetai</b> and kiang populations need attention and verification. The identity of a few historically important specimens in zoological gardens and museums could be clarified...|$|E
