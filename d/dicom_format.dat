40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} concise and {{effective}} approach termed discriminative feature representation (DFR) for low dose computerized tomography (LDCT) image processing, {{which is currently}} a challenging problem in medical imaging field. This DFR method assumes LDCT images as the superposition of desirable high dose CT (HDCT) 3 D features and undesirable noise- artifact 3 D features (the combined term of noise and artifact features induced by low dose scan protocols), and the decomposed HDCT features are used to provide the processed LDCT images with higher quality. The target HDCT features are solved via the DFR algorithm using a featured dictionary composed by atoms representing HDCT features and noise-artifact features. In this study, the featured dictionary is efficiently built using physical phantom images collected from the same CT scanner as the target clinical LDCT images to process. The proposed DFR method also has good robustness in parameter setting for different CT scanner types. This DFR method can be directly applied to process <b>DICOM</b> <b>formatted</b> LDCT images, and has good applicability to current CT systems.

40|$|Introduction: Periacetabular {{osteotomy}} (PAO) is {{an effective}} joint-preserving procedure for young adults with developmental dysplasia of the hip. Although PAO provides excellent radiographic and clinical results, it is a technically demanding procedure with a distinct learning curve that requires careful 3 D planning and, above all, {{has a number of}} potential complications. We therefore developed a pre-operative simulation method for PAO via creation of a new full-scale model. 				 					Methods: The model was prepared from the patient’s Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (<b>DICOM)</b> <b>formatted</b> data from computed tomography (CT), for construction and assembly using 3 D printing technology. A major feature of our model is that it is constructed from salt. In contrast to conventional models, our model provides a more accurate representation, at a lower manufacturing cost, and requires a shorter production time. Furthermore, our model realized simulated operation normally with using a chisel and drill without easy breakage or fissure. We were able to easily simulate the line of osteotomy and confirm acetabular version and coverage after moving to the osteotomized fragment. Additionally, this model allowed a dynamic assessment that avoided anterior impingement following the osteotomy. 				 					Results: Our models clearly reflected the anatomical shape of the patient’s hip. Our models allowed for surgical simulation, making realistic use of the chisel and drill. Our method of pre-operative simulation for PAO allowed for the assessment of accurate osteotomy line, determination of the position of the osteotomized fragment, and prevented anterior impingement after the operation. 				 					Conclusion: Our method of pre-operative simulation might improve the safety, accuracy, and results of PAO...|$|R

40|$|Background: With {{increase}} of digital imaging, {{the need for}} storage space and transmission speed also increases. Compressed images need less storage space and decrease the transmission time. However, compression could compromise image quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of image compression on the identification of cephalometric points on direct digital lateral cephalogram images, compared with the digital imaging and communications in medicine (<b>DICOM)</b> <b>format.</b> Materials and Methods: In this analytical-descriptive study, 19 direct digital lateral cephalograms saved in <b>DICOM</b> <b>format</b> were used. They were converted to joint photographic experts group (JPEG) 2000 format with quality factors 85, 75, and 60 adding up to 76 images (DICOM, JPEG 85, 75, and 60). The images were randomized and eight cephalometric points were identified on each image by a professional, using the x-y coordinate system. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to investigate if there was a statistically significant difference in the location of cephalometric points between each group of images. All tests were applied at a significance level of 5 %. Results: The results did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the identification of the eight cephalometric points between the DICOM images and the JPEG 2000 quality factors 85, 75, and 60.
