5000|$|While no {{apparent}} suicide note was left behind, Jeong had posted her thoughts on her personal blog on Cyworld {{a day before}} she killed herself. Under the title [...] "The End" [...] (or [...] "Finished"), she wrote: [...] Everything is so complicated. I get angry for no reason and I feel like I'm going crazy. It hurts so much that I feel like I'm getting seasick. My head hurts so much that I start to tear. I was becoming a slave to my temper. I thought that I was losing myself, losing my identity. Then, as if lightning had struck, all became quiet. The Lord came to me with love. He made me realize my importance and gave me courage. I was about to collapse, and he lifted me up, saying it's going to be okay. YES, <b>I</b> <b>WILL</b> <b>BE</b> <b>OKAY.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Kyle Busch won {{the pole}} {{with a time}} of 50.444 and a speed of 178.416 mph. “I told you I had a fast car, I just wasn’t sure we could get the balance right,” Busch said after winning the pole. “(Crew chief) Adam Stevens and these guys, they did it again.” “A lot of that lies on me for putting the lap {{together}} something I hadn’t done {{over the last couple of}} months,” Kevin Harvick said after qualifying second. “I feel like we all did a good job there and made some good adjustments. I feel like I probably gave up a little bit in Turn 1. I got a little bit tight in the center of that corner, but all-in-all it was a good lap and I’m glad we ran our fastest speed in the last round. That is what you have to do.” “Not bad,” Tony Stewart said after qualifying fifth. “ (Crew chief) Chad Johnston came over in between the practice session and qualifying and showed me some stuff where I was losing some time. That is what we focused on for qualifying and it worked.” “We were pretty good in that final round but not quite good enough to get the pole there,” said Brad Keselowski after qualifying ninth. “We were missing a little bit in one of the corners, but all-in-all a good effort. We had the fastest car in practice so I feel pretty good about that. It is similar to what we had at the Brickyard and we were really strong there but just needed a little more to win so I am optimistic about it for sure.” “We really struggled for whatever reason in Turn 1 today,” said Martin Truex, Jr. after qualifying 13th “Just can’t seem to get the balance right. We were either too tight or too loose no matter what we do. Fought the same thing there, not a big deal though <b>I</b> think we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>okay.</b> We’ve got plenty of time to figure it out tomorrow. We’ve got a few cars to pass, but 13th is not too bad. We did it last week.” ...|$|R
