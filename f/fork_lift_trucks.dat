25|$|With {{a design}} team {{consisting}} of Russell Bruce, Kent Ivor and James Charles he patented significant {{improvements to the}} invention of the modern day fork lift truck which has {{had a significant impact on}} international commerce through palletised container movements. In particular, Dolphin proposed a design of the lifting carriage of a masted fork lift truck which applies a downward thrust to counteract the bending moment produced on the mast by the load on the load support The team also patented a solution to prevent <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> <b>trucks</b> having to keep repositioning to lift loads by designing a horizontally movable slide.|$|E

50|$|The {{slip sheet}} {{is used as}} a pallet support device in vehicle {{delivery}} and transportation of products.

With the slip sheet supported by one of these transportation devices the unit load can easily be transported both internally within a facility and externally between two facility locations.|$|R
