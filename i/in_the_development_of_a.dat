5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late on October 12, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 13 off the north coast of Honduras. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on October 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a very broad subtropical low, {{as well as a}} poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} factor was the {{development in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors {{around the world and}} served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which {{was at the center of}} many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E

After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. Crash is unable to rescue his sister but manages to defeat Cortex, and he begins his search for Coco, interrogating Dingodile, Tiny Tiger, N. Gin, and Uka Uka on her whereabouts. Crash finally confronts and defeats Nina Cortex inside of the Doominator robot, liberates his sister, and averts the destruction of Wumpa Island. Feeling happy for themselves, Crash and his family decide to celebrate their victory with pancakes, which he blurts out (speaking for the first time) in joy. Soon after, in Crash: Mind over Mutant, the NV, a personal digital assistant that everyone must possess, is released to the public. However, this {{turns out to be a}} plot by Doctor Cortex and his old partner Doctor Nitrus Brio, who use the NV's Mojo-transmitting powers to control everyone who uses the device. Because Crash is unaffected by the NV, he is able to free his friends from the control of the NV and stop Cortex's and Brio's plot.|$|E

5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall {{in a rural area}} of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi. The remnants continued into northern Louisiana and then turned northward, before dissipating over Arkansas on August3.|$|E

Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of the trading day, the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to OEMs. By then the company was the world's largest producer of software for personal computers—ahead of former leader Lotus Development—and published the three most-popular Macintosh business applications. That year the company purchased Forethought, the developer of PowerPoint and Microsoft's first major software acquisition.|$|E
5|$|Rivals John Comyn and Robert the Bruce, {{grandson}} of the claimant, were appointed as joint guardians in his place. On 10 February 1306, Bruce {{participated in the}} murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. Less than seven weeks later, on 25 March, Bruce was crowned as king. However, Edward's forces overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the Battle of Methven. Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V, his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolph only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control. Edward I had died in 1307. His heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and reassert control. Robert defeated that army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, securing de facto independence. In 1320 the Declaration of Arbroath, a remonstrance to the pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince Pope John XXII to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The declaration has also been seen {{as one of the most}} important documents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Scottish national identity.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{abolition}} of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt {{the decline of the}} building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of the noble gases aided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon {{until the end of}} the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E

As the cold low drifted southward, a surface low developed on October12. The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained stationary over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm.
