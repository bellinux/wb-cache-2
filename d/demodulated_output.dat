Ideally, when using LIAs, {{it would be}} possible to measure a minimum signal variation limited by the instrument input equivalent noise at the operating frequency and the chosen filtering bandwidth. Instead, digital LIAs show an unforeseen 1 /f noise at the instrument <b>demodulated</b> <b>output,</b> proportional to the signal amplitude that poses a fundamental limit to the minimum detectable signal variation using the lock-in technique. In particular, the typical resolution limit of fast operating LIAs (> 1 MHz) is of tens of ppm, orders of magnitude worse than the expected value. A detailed analysis shows that the additional noise is due to slow fluctuations of the signal gain from the generation stage to the acquisition one, mainly due to the digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters.

40|$|Abstract — MIMO {{systems with}} several antennas at the trans-mitter and {{receiver}} {{have the potential}} to enable high throughputs. One of the challenges in realizing this potential is the design of receivers that scale in terms of computation and performance. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a receiver that uses a committee of linear receivers, whose parameters are estimated from training data using a variant of the AdaBoost algorithm, a celebrated supervised classification algorithm in machine learning. We call our receiver boosted MMSE (B-MMSE) receiver and we study its performance via simulations. The channel matrix is estimated from the pilot using the MMSE technique. We find that for a 4 × 4 system with a Rayleigh fading channel, using BPSK at a bit error rate (BER) of 10 − 2, our receiver using the estimated channel matrix needs 2 dB less power than the plain MMSE receiver based on the estimated channel matrix. On an average, excluding the training phase, the receiver complexity equals 1. 25 linear receivers. Thus the B-MMSE receiver is slightly more complex than the MMSE receiver and substantially less complex than the maximum-likelihood receiver. We also show that the coded BER performance with an outer rate- 3 / 4 Turbo-code has a gain of 5 dB at 10 − 4 coded BER when the <b>demodulated</b> <b>output</b> from the proposed method is used in place of plain MMSE detection with MMSE estimated channel...|$|E
40|$|Ideally, lock-in {{amplifiers}} (LIAs) {{would be}} able to measure a minimum signal variation limited by the noise of the front-end amplifier and the filtering bandwidth. On the contrary, a detailed characterization of digital LIAs shows an unforeseen 1 /f noise at the instruments <b>demodulated</b> <b>output,</b> proportional to the total signal amplitude. The signal-proportionality and 1 /f nature of the measured noise pose a fundamental limit to the LIAs achievable resolution. This limit {{has been found to be}} dependent from the instrument maximum operating frequency, from few ppm for LIAs operating up to few hundreds of kHz, to few tens of ppm for LIAs operating up to few MHz or tens of MHz. The additional noise is due to slow gain fluctuations that the signal experiences from the generation stage to the acquisition one. To compensate them, a switched ratiometric technique based on two ADCs alternately acquiring the signal coming from the device under test and the stimulus signal has been conceived. The idea is that both signals should experience the same gain fluctuations, which can be successively removed by means of a division on the outputs of the synchronous demodulation. An FPGA-based LIA working up to 10 MHz and implementing the technique has been realized and results demonstrate a resolution improvement of more than an order of magnitude compared to standard implementations working up to similar frequencies (from tens of ppm down to sub-ppm values) ...|$|E

The Laser Vibrometer measures target vibration velocity {{in the direction of the}} incident laser beam and typically samples a region of a speckle pattern on its photodetector. Target motions can cause the speckle pattern to change on the photodetector surface, particularly when target motions are non-normal to the direction of the laser beam. This speckle motion modulates the Doppler signal and adds noise to the <b>demodulated</b> <b>output</b> signal. Periodic target motions can cause the speckle noise to become pseudo-random and produce harmonic peaks, with the same fundamental frequency as the genuine target vibrations, which can be indistinguishable from the genuine target vibrations.

This paper reports preliminary results quantifying speckle noise levels using controlled experimental configurations incorporating periodic in-plane and tilt target motions. Working with commercial Laser Vibrometers, various target surface finishes and treatments are considered and speckle noise maps are produced for each configuration. For a tilting surface, speckle noise has been quantified at approximately 1 μm s− 1 /deg s− 1 while, for surfaces with in-plane motion, the sensitivity to speckle noise has been estimated pessimistically at 0. 1 % of the in-plane velocity.

It is also shown that the channel is symmetric and admits a simple expression for its capacity when its noise is stationary ergodic. The 2 q-ary noise process is next modeled via a generalized version of the recently studied binary queue-based channel (2007) to produce a mathematically tractable stationary ergodic M’th order Markovian noise source with 2 q + 2 parameters. Numerical results indicate that the capacity of the discrete channel with q = 2, 3 is substantially improved over the cases of perfect channel interleaving (which yields an equivalent memoryless channel) and of hard-decision demodulation (q = 1). These results point to potentially large performance gains achievable by designing coding schemes for this discrete channel that exploit both its memory and softdecision information, as opposed to ignoring either of them.

40|$|Abstract: The {{bandwidth}} of PWM inverters {{is limited}} by the <b>output</b> <b>demodulating</b> L-C filter. In order to synthesize complex waveforms and modulate low distortion and high frequency sinewaves the cut-off frequency of the filter must be increased and consequently the switching frequency of the power semiconductors and the losses must be increased also. The output power stage of a single-phase single-supply PWM inverter very often consists of power switches, implemented with an adequate number of parallel-connected semiconductor switches. The separation of the parallel-connected semiconductor switches, that are often used, into groups (or the split of single high power semiconductors in more lower power semiconductor groups) with different drive can produce a multilevel PWM resulting a significant bandwidth increment, reduction of harmonic distortion and weight of the output L-C filter. This paper describes a method that produces a five-level (line-to-line) Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM). Results show that if the inverter output THD that is caused from the SPWM carrier is reduced by 6 dB, then a double bandwidth system is resulted. Furthermore a half weight output LC filter can be used to implement a higher power density system. The inverter output internal resistance is also reduced up to four times compared to the conventional design, when the inverter uses negative feedback...|$|R
