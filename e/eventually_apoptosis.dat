50|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} developed siRNAs {{capable of}} targeting both polo-like kinase 1(PLK1) and kinesin spindle protein(KSP). Both proteins {{are important to}} the cell-cycle of tumor cells, PLK1 involved with phosphorylation of a variety of proteins and KSP integral to chromosome segregation during mitosis. Specifically, bipolar mitotic spindles are unable to form when KSP is inhibited, leading to arrest of the cell cycle and, <b>eventually,</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Likewise, inhibition of PLK1 facilitates mitotic arrests and cell apoptosis. According to the study, a 2 mg/kg dose of PLK1-specific siRNA administered for 3 weeks to mice implanted with tumors resulted in increased survival times and obvious reduction of tumors. In fact, the median survival time of treated mice was 51 days as opposed to 32 days for the controls. Further, only 2 of the 6 mice treated had noticeable tumors around the implantation site. Even so, GAPDH, a tumor-derived signal, was present at low levels, indicating significant suppression of tumor growth but not complete elimination. Still, the results suggested minimal toxicity and no significant dysfunction of the bone marrow. Animals treated with KSP-specific siRNA, too, exhibited increased survival times of 28 days compared to 20 days in the controls.|$|E
30|$|NOA 1 (Nitric oxide-associated protein 1) is a {{guanosine}} triphosphate-binding protein {{encoded in}} chromosomal DNA that localizes predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix, and {{is involved in}} mitochondrial protein biogenesis and apoptosis.

None of the classical sorafenib targets (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 /-receptor 2, VEGFR 1 /-R 2; platelet-derived growth factor receptor α/-receptor β, PDGFR-α/-β; c-KIT) was expressed at significant levels leaving RAF proteins as its likely molecular target. Low sorafenib concentrations paradoxically increased cell viability, whereas higher concentrations induced G 1 arrest and <b>eventually</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> MAPK signaling remained partly active after sorafenib treatment, especially in T 24 cells with an oncogenic HRAS mutation.

These findings suggest mitochondrial dysfunction during early EAU. As we reported in an earlier study, damaged or altered mtDNA is a primary target for oxidative damage [7]. mtDNA damage causes amplification of oxidative stress by decreasing the expression of essential proteins for electron transport like malate dehydrogenase, leading to reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysregulation which will <b>eventually</b> cause <b>apoptosis.</b>|$|R

For specific deregulated proteins, the thapsigargin-induced proteomic signature was compared by Western blotting to that resulting from the treatment of hepatoma cells with reducing agents or with proteasome inhibitors, to elicit endoplasmic reticulum stress by additional means and to reveal novel, potential targets of the unfolded protein response pathway...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying PDT-induced apoptosis mainly involved two signaling pathways: (1) death receptor-mediated exogenous pathway and (2) mitochondria-mediated endogenous pathway. It {{is known}} that activation of the endogenous pathway rather than the exogenous pathway is typically {{the main cause of}} PDT-induced apoptosis [24 – 26]. Cytoplasmic cytochrome C (Cyc) and apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf- 1) form a heptameric apoptotic complex that binds to, cleaves, and thereby activates the caspase- 9 zymogen. Caspase- 9 hydrolyzes and activates caspase- 3 / 7, which reaches the same termination point produced by the aforementioned exogenous pathway [27 – 29]. The death receptor-mediated exogenous (caspase- 8) pathway ultimately activates caspase- 3 to induce apoptosis.

One major complication with the current methods of treating cancer with chemotherapy is that treatment is not optimized to specifically target cancer cells and the widespread distribution of chemotherapeutic drugs throughout the body can cause harmful side effects such as naseua, hair loss, and cardiotoxicity. Since many of the characteristics of AuNPs allow them to target cancer cells specifically and accumulate within tumor cells, these molecules can act as tumor-targeting drug delivery systems.

The cytotoxic effects were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry. The cell cycle progression and ER stress-associated molecules were examined by Western blot and flow cytometry. Moreover, the cytotoxic effects of celecoxib combined with glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 knockdown (siRNA), (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or MG 132 were assessed. We demonstrated that celecoxib markedly reduces the cell viability and causes apoptosis in human UC cells through cell cycle G 1 arrest. Celecoxib possessed the ability to activate ER stress-related chaperones (IRE- 1 α and GRP 78), caspase- 4, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), which were involved in UC cell apoptosis. Down-regulation of GRP 78 by siRNA, co-treatment with EGCG (a GRP 78 inhibitor) or with MG 132 (a proteasome inhibitor) could enhance celecoxib-induced apoptosis.

Additionally, I expressed and purified three reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (E 352 Q, E 396 D, K 398 R), which are considered benign variants. Variants were also compared by circular dichroism, revealing high b-sheet content and wild-type structure.

Cells can protect themselves from potentially lethal stimuli by expressing antiapoptotic factors, such as inhibitors of apoptosis, FLICE (caspase 8) -inhibitory proteins, {{and members of the}} Bcl 2 family. Here, we describe a mechanism that allows cells to survive once executioner caspases have been activated. This mechanism relies on the partial cleavage of RasGAP by caspase 3 into an amino-terminal fragment called fragment N. Generation of this fragment leads to the activation of the antiapoptotic Akt kinase, preventing further amplification of caspase activity. Partial cleavage of RasGAP is required for cell survival under stress conditions because cells expressing an uncleavable RasGAP mutant cannot activate Akt, cannot prevent amplification of caspase 3 activity, and <b>eventually</b> undergo <b>apoptosis.</b> Executioner caspases therefore control the extent of their own activation by a feedback regulatory mechanism initiated by the partial cleavage of RasGAP that is crucial for cell survival under adverse conditions...|$|R
