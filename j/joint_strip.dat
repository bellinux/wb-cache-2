40|$|This {{report is}} an {{overview}} of the research that was performed for the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) concerning the performance of bridge deck expansion joints. The purpose of the research is to evaluate several types of joints currently in use and also provides the evaluation criteria for rating the joint condition. The types of joints investigated are Compression Seal (B. S.) <b>joint,</b> <b>Strip</b> Seal (S. S.) joint, Integral Abutment Jointless (I. A.) joint, Poured Silicone (XJS) joint, and Polymer Modified Asphalt (LDI and PaveTech) joint. The research was performed by questionnaire surveys, Roadway Management data analysis, expert interviews, and site assessment. The problems and their causes, the merits, the potential improvements, and the estimated lives of these types of joints were identified from the questionnaire surveys. The results showed that the S. S., B. S., and I. A. joints are rated as the top three for their longer estimated lives as well as other attributes The results of the factor and logistic regression analyses of the INDOT Roadway Management data indicate that the performances of the S. S., B. S., and I. A. joint are rated first, second, and third respectively, based on deterioration rates under identical conditions of traffic loading, settlement, and age. Other types of joints could not be analyzed due to insufficient data. The investigation of the practices of surrounding states revealed that each state has its own experiences in using and maintaining the joints. There are no uniform drawings, specifications, and maintenance strategies among the investigated states. The investigation also showed that the Integral Abutment Expansion joint (I. A.) is commonly being used in the surrounding states. Finally the research provides pilot evaluation schemes for inspecting joints. Based on the findings of this research, an implementation policy has been designed to ensure the longer service life of expansion joints...|$|E

40|$|Finite element {{modelling}} {{and experimental}} study of the structural behaviour involving the stiffness and strength of an innovative composite panel system known as the Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) system, to be applied as roofing units in buildings, is investigated in this paper. The system consists of profiled steel sheeting connected to dry board by self-drilling and self-tapping screws. This study considered the behaviour of the PSSDB panel under an out-of plane uniform load to understand the behaviour of the PSSDB panel when it is positioned in a ‘reversed’ position {{in order to make}} it more practical and applicable. In addition, the effect of introducing side timber strips along the edge side of the panel system is also studied. It is found that the timber strips increased the stiffness value from 57. 6 kNm 2 m– 1 to 78. 2 kNm 2 m– 1, i. e., an increase of 35. 8 % compared to panels without timber <b>jointing</b> <b>strips.</b> In fact, the maximum load that can be sustained by the connected panels was increased from 3. 47 kN m– 1 to 6 kN m– 1. The finite element model developed has shown accuracy within 5 % to 11 % compared to experimental results in predicting the deflection of the PSSDB panel...|$|R

5000|$|... 4. Hydrophilic or [...] "water-loving" [...] waterstops are {{strips of}} rubber, {{modified}} with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell {{in the presence}} of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction <b>joints.</b> Hydrophilic <b>strip</b> applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the waterstop expands to seal the joint. The American Concrete Institute recommends against the use of hydrophilic waterstops for hazardous fluids such as fuels, acids, and process chemicals, as the products may not swell as intended in fluids other than water.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{fast and}} {{reliable}} thinning algorithm In this paper a new {{algorithm is proposed}} for skeletonizing binary digital images. The algorithm does not employ the conventional pixel- or non-pixel-based techniques. Instead, it identifies regions of particular shapes in the image and substitutes apppropriate skeleton patterns for them. Initially, as many horizontal and vertical strips as possible are detected. These correspond to rather straight, long and narrow regions in the original image. Any remaining regions correspond to <b>joints</b> between <b>strips.</b> The strips are then grouped into trapezoidal regions which may {{be replaced by the}} appropriate skeleton patterns. The individual skeleton patterns are then merged using the skeletons due to the jointing regions, generating the final skeleton. A compact representation is obtained for post-processing, and the issue of robustness with respect to noise is addressed...|$|R
