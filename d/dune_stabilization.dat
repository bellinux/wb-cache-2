The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization,</b> since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E

40|$|Alternating {{units of}} dune sands and paleosols {{in the central}} Inner Mongolia imply {{multiple}} episodes of <b>dune</b> building and <b>stabilization,</b> {{in response to the}} waxing and waning of the East Asian monsoon. Such eolian deposits were dated by using the single-aliquot-quartz optical dating method. Combined with the multi-proxy study on the deposits, the past environmental changes during the Holocene have been reconstructed. Our results indicate that widespread eolian sand mobilization occurred in the studied region during the beginning of the early Holocene from 11. 5 ka to ∼ 9 ka. The climate became warm and humid during the period between ∼ 9 ka and ∼ 5. 6 ka (Holocene Optimum). After ∼ 5. 6 ka, the region again became arid, as inferred from dune building. However, the environmental changes during the late Holocene have been affected by both climate and human impacts, and the presence of desert environment in such semiarid region is not only the result of climatic drought of the late Holocene, but also related to poor land-use practices. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Received 18 / 6 / 2011; {{accepted}} for publication 17 / 2 / 2012) ABSTRACT. When designing and constructing highways or more generally any super structures on dune sands type of soil, {{it is essential to}} make sure that the foundation soil is stable and provides good support to the applied loads. Dune sands soil are known to spread in huge areas throughout the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in which thousands of miles of new roads and highways are being constructed every year. Replacing such kind of weak soil is not an economically feasible alternative since it is very costly; besides, the replacement soil is not always available in nearby sites. This study discusses the possibility of <b>dune</b> sands soil <b>stabilization</b> using Portland cement as the stabilizing agent. Various ratios of cement content mixed with dune sands are used to examine the improvement of engineering properties of dune sands in terms of strength characteristics, and shear strength parameters. The results indicate that mixing dune sands with cement stabilizing agents would influence the engineering properties of treated soil. It is determined that the cement <b>stabilization</b> of <b>dune</b> sands improves the strength characteristics of the treated soil so that it becomes usable as a base material for roads construction and proper foundation material for other types of super structures. It was also determined that a cement content more than 9 % may not probably cause any additional improvement for the stabilized soil. A suggested relationship is introduced to predict the values of initial tangent elastic modulus for such type of cement-treated dune sands...|$|R

40|$|Foredunes {{are formed}} and {{developed}} {{in association with}} vegetation. A bare sand area has been viewed {{as a measure of}} dune mobility or activity and researched in association with climate controls: particularly wind power, annual mean precipitation, and temperature, expressed in annual mean potential evapotranspiration. There has been no research that utilized the patterns of bare sand areas to classify foredune areas in coastal dune systems and investigated climate controls related to sand patch patterns, or ?foredune textures? such as size, number, and distribution of sand patches Four foredune types were classified based on four landscape metrics (PLAND: percentage of bare sand area, PLADJ: proportion of like-adjacencies, NLSI: normalized landscape shape index, and ENN_RA: range of Euclidean nearest neighbor), by applying the concepts and methodologies of landscape ecology. Four climate variables (annual mean precipitation, annual mean potential evapotranspiration, Lancaster?s mobility index, and the standard deviation of annual mean precipitation) were found to affect the foredune types and help in distinguishing one foredune type from another. The amount of bare sand area on coastal foredune areas can be explained by annual mean precipitation (R^ 2 is 0. 52 at the 99 % confidence level), standard deviation of precipitation (R^ 2 is 0. 51 at the 99 % confidence level), and Lancaster?s mobility index (R^ 2 is 0. 37 at the 99 % confidence level) but wind variables such as drift potential do not explain much (R^ 2 is 0. 04 at maximum). This suggests that <b>dune</b> activity or <b>stabilization</b> in coastal <b>dune</b> systems is mainly controlled by vegetation cover, which is in turn affected by precipitation. Foredune textures can be a useful tool to predict foredune types in association with future climate change, and the optimal averaging period of precipitation for each bare sand area was seven years...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{study of}} Ammophila, a,renaria (L.) Link, (European beachgrass) {{plantations}} {{was carried out}} on sand dunes along the Oregon coast to observe the vegetation changes which occur {{over a period of}} years. Control of moving sand has been important on a world-wide basis for many years. In Oregon this problem has been the cause of concern since the 1930 's. Ammophila is well adapted to the extreme environment of a coastal area and t is most vigorous in areas of drifting sand. It is a coarse, perennial grass used extensively in planting of sand <b>dunes</b> for <b>stabilization.</b> Ammop 1 i 1 a is the primary species used in the Oregon plantation work. Transplanting of the grass clones is the moat frequently used method of planting on the dunes. Clones are planted with varying density and number of culms per hill according to the direction and degree of the slope. The planting is carried out between November and April when weather is cool and wet. To insure permanent stabilization, secondary woody species are planted in the established Ammophila. The species used are Cytisus scoparius (Scotchbroom) and Pinus contorta (Lodgepole or shorepine). Cytius is planted before or concurrently with the Pinus to provide protection for the Pinus. Thirteen consecutive years of plantations were located and studied south of Florence, Oregon, where planting has been in progress since 1949. A 25 foot square plot was located in a uniform and typical area within the plantation. The plot was divided into five foot square quadrats with three foot square quadrats placed within each of these. Data included height, cover, diameter of clumps and density of Ammophila; height, cover and density of Pinus and Cytisus; cover of litter and Mnium sp. (moss); and frequency of the native species present in the plots. An analysis of sand determined the pH, total nitrogen and organic matter present. The plantations varied in overall appearance for the 13 years. Ammophila showed a definite change from the clumped growth form observed {{in the first years of}} growth after planting to solitary shoots present in the oldest plots observed. Pinus and Cytisus showed a varied appearance throughout the plots with a general increase in height and cover. Density varied with the degree of success of the plantings. Native species were present and the frequencies varied with plantation age and location. The soil analysis proved a definite decrease in pH with age of the plantation. The oldest plot observed showed numerous native species including. Picea sitchensis (Sitka Spruce). In time the areas now being planted will develop a typical native vegetation without any of the original planted species present...|$|R

Topsoil (0 - 5 cm) physico-chemical characteristics are presented in a series of baseline GIS maps, displaying spatial pedo-property variation across the dune landscape. Combined with vegetation data, topsoil analysis identifies 10 distinct pedo-environments. Physico-chemical characteristics of associated National Soil Resources Institute (NSRI) soil profile classifications and an exposed stratigraphic section are presented graphically in a proposed sequence of development. Topsoil and soil profile samples are analysed for soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM) content, particle size, geochemical composition and mineral magnetism. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) are apparent for the suite of topsoil characteristics collated, indicating discrete dune environments are influenced by specific soil properties. Distinct down-profile variations in soil characteristics are also apparent between dune environments, highlighting pedological dynamism. Multivariate Factor analysis groups bare sand and mobile dune communities into ‘frontal dunes’ and fixed dune community, pasture, scrub, deciduous woodland and coniferous plantations into ‘hind dunes’, separating these topsoil environments from heath and slack communities. Factor analysis also identifies linkages between pedo-characteristics within soil profile horizons, suggesting pedogenesis on the Sefton dunes initiates as raw sand, progressing to sand-pararendzinas through leaching of nutrients. Desalinization and decalcification processes lead to brown earth development, followed by increased acidicification, subsequently, resulting in micro-podzol formation.

40|$|Porcupine Strand, on {{the central}} coast of Labrador, has {{experienced}} dramatic landscape changes since deglaciation: sea level has fallen over 110 m; the former nearshore seabed now lies exposed, forming the coastal lowlands; powerful glacier-fed braided rivers flowed across the northern lowlands, carrying sand and gravel to the sea; with sea-level change, the coastline configuration has evolved from a large indented embayment to a relatively straight shoreline. Although most of this landscape change occurred quite rapidly during {{the two or three}} millennia following deglaciation, considerable change must have been witnessed by humans since they first occupied the Strand over 7200 ¹⁴C BP. Perhaps the most notable of these were changes in sea level and related coastline displacement, climate variability and its impact on landscape processes (e. g., coastal erosion, sand dune activity), and vegetation change. Because prehistoric cultures relied heavily on marine resources and located their habitation sites close to the active shoreline, the position of ancient shorelines is critical in planning archaeological surveys and interpreting site function in the context of local environment and landscape. [...] The primary objectives of this research are: (1) to refine postglacial relative sea-level history using new radiocarbon-dated geological and archaeological samples; (2) to reconstruct palaeoshoreline elevation and configuration for selected time slices using relative sea-level records, topography and mapped raised marine features; and (3) to interpret the local landscape context of archaeological sites preserved in sand dunes and on raised beaches. [...] Two 1 : 50, 000 scale surficial geology maps (13 H 114 E and Wand 13 I/ 3 W) were prepared from aerial photograph interpretation and limited field mapping as baseline data for the study. Glaciofluvial sand and gravel, deposited in front of the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet, constitute {{a large proportion of the}} surficial sediment in the map area. Coastal exposures, extending tens of kilometres along the Strand, reveal thick deposits of glaciomarine mud and sand overlying rare occurrences of till and bedrock. Glaciomarine sediments were deposited by glacier-fed meltwater streams onto the glacioisostatically depressed coastal lowlands, forming Hjulström type deltas. Raised shorelines were identified up to 116 m above present sea level. Fossiliferous mud and sand underlie much of the coastal lowlands, and in places is obscured by bog. Organic samples (4 shell, 2 driftwood) from raised marine sediments were collected for radiocarbon dating. They range in age from 30 to 8820 ¹⁴C BP. Aeolian deflation of emerged glaciomarine sand has resulted in the development of dune systems discontinuously along the entire Strand. Radiocarbon dates on buried soils (n= 10) and peaty horizons (n= 2) in the dunes range between 40 and 3000 ¹⁴C BP and indicate periodic cycles of stabilization and reactivation. Coastal hills and upland surfaces consist mostly of exposed or concealed bedrock having only minor till cover. [...] Holocene marine limit elevation declines from 116 m in the south to 98 m above sea level (asl) in the north. The establishment of marine limit is estimated to be between 9000 and 8000 ¹⁴C BP based on a marine shell date in the south and a previously published age on the isolation of a freshwater basin to the north, respectively. Initial emergence was rapid in the south at 6. 4 m/century until 7000 ¹⁴C BP, when relative sea level dropped below the modem shoreline. No data are available to reconstruct the submerged interval of sea-level history. Farther north, initial emergence was slightly slower at 4. 6 m/century until 6000 - 7000 ¹⁴C BP. After this time the relative sea-level record is poorly constrained and may represent either continued slow emergence to present or emergence followed by submergence. This latter scenario is supported by the apparent absence of raised marine deposits in the age range 30 to 6750 ¹⁴C BP and evidence for recent coastal submergence (e. g. coastal cliff recession). [...] Many archaeological sites are located on raised beaches. All prehistoric groups are represented by sites within 15 m of sea level. No obvious pattern is identified between site age and elevation; however this may be explained by the small change in the relative sea level position over the last 6000 to 7000 ¹⁴C BP. If sites older than 7000 ¹⁴C BP are present, they should occur on shorelines higher than 15 m asl. The position and configuration of these shorelines are reconstructed using the refined sea-level history and available topographic data for the Strand. These shorelines tend to be highly embayed in contrast to the relatively straight shorelines of the last 7000 ¹⁴C BP or so. These reconstructed coastal landscapes should help refine search strategies for older archaeological site on the Strand. [...] The oldest radiocarbon-dated soil suggests that sand dune development has primarily occurred over the last 3000 ¹⁴C BP. Buried soils and peat horizons overlie strongly indurated marine and glaciomarine sediments. These sediments are the likely source of the aeolian sand. Twelve radiocarbon-dated buried soils and peat indicate eight periods of <b>dune</b> re-vegetation and <b>stabilization</b> in the last 500 ¹⁴C BP, which were likely due to changing local conditions (e. g., aridity, forest fires, and human activity). [...] Over half of the archaeological sites recorded on the Strand are exposed in sand dunes through deflation. As a result, much of the artifact evidence and related cultural features (e. g., fire hearths) are reworked onto the bottoms of blowouts and have lost their stratigraphic context. Archaeological sites were located in four blowouts which also contain dated soil horizons. Generally, there is weak correspondence between the interpreted age of the cultural material and the radiocarbon-dated soil horizons exposed in blowout walls. This is thought to reflect the locally variable and complex dune stratigraphy. Caution is therefore advised in using dated soil horizons in sand dunes to define cultural history of local archaeological sites along the Strand...|$|R

50|$|The {{ability of}} marram grass to grow on and bind sand {{makes it a}} useful plant in the {{stabilization}} of coastal dunes and artificial defences on sandy coasts. The usefulness was recognized in the late 18th century.

Hence, legislation promoting <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization</b> came into force in 1779 and 1792, successively leading {{to a system of}} state-supported dune planters overlooked by dune bailifs.

50|$|Grey dunes {{are formed}} when {{pioneering}} plant species inhabit embryo dunes and begin a successional process toward <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization</b> and soil formation. Pioneer plants capture saltating sand grains {{carried by the}} wind and deposit them to continue build up the dune. Grey dunes are then formed after the root structures of pioneering plants stabilize foredunes. Sand stabilization allows for dead plant material to be decomposed within the soil, adding nutrients and water-retention abilities to the soil. As soil starts to slowly form, new plant species colonize the stable dunes ultimately developing more extensive root structures and plant diversity. When the dune has become continuously vegetated, lichen and moss grows in the understory, providing a water-repellent surface that reduces erosion (through rainfall and wind), this results in the official formation of the grey dune.|$|E

The eight species of plants that were developed by the center are used for coastal wetland remediation, restoration, and enhancement. These plants have proven effective in converting open water to new marsh. The eight species of plants are: ‘Pelican germplasm’ black mangrove ( [...] Avicennia germinans), ‘Caminada germplasm’ sea oats (Uniola paniculata), ‘Vermillion’ smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), ‘Gulf coast’ marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), ‘Brazoria germplasm’ seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum), ‘Boyou Lafourche germplasm’ California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus), ‘Timbalier germplasm’ gulf bluestem (Schizachyrium maritimum), ‘Fourchon germplasm’ bitter panicum (Panicum amarum). LAPMC works continuously to reach its three goals. First, identify and evaluate species for coastal erosion control, marsh restoration and <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization.</b> Second, provide plants and technology to assist commercial growers in addressing coastal resource concerns. Third, provide educational opportunities and access to all segments {{of the community to}} the Golden Meadow Plant Materials Center Program.|$|E
50|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised mosses and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization,</b> since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
5000|$|North Carolina {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{progressive}} states when it comes to addressing hurricane related land-use issues. This is probably because the state has received the second most direct hurricane strikes in the US. North Carolina pairs strong regional coastal management with intelligent hazard mitigation efforts to create an effective statewide emergency management program. It is important to initiate these actions during the recovery phase of a disaster in order to prevent repeat tragedies and wasted tax dollars. These mitigation efforts paired with restrictions on hard beach structures protect the natural ability of a coastal region to maintain itself, and protects future coastal developments. As a result of the federally mandated Coastal Zone Management Program, North Carolina passed CAMA, both of which produced a number of hurricane mitigation efforts in North Carolina. The Albemarle-Pamilico watershed is part of the National Estuary Program. CAMA requires a review and approval by an appropriate government body for areas designated as [...] "Areas of Environment Concern" [...] (AEC). These include estuarine areas and ocean hazard areas. Within the ocean hazard areas category of AECs are ocean erodible zones, high hazard flood areas, and inlet hazard areas. Each of these zones have general regulations that establish setbacks, erosion control projects, <b>dune</b> <b>stabilization,</b> and prevents all development in some areas. North Carolina requires a setback for all [...] "major structures" [...] of 60 times the annual erosion rate and prohibits construction of seawalls and other permanent protective structures.|$|E
