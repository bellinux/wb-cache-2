5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach {{is possible and}} easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of}} the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

25|$|Results {{can also}} depend heavily on sample {{preparation}} {{and how it}} was run/introduced. An important example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of a point of {{reference}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{complications}} in studying hydrogen isotopes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> exchangeability. At many time scales, ranging from hours to geological epochs, scientists have to consider if the hydrogen moieties in studied molecules are the original species or if they represent exchange with water or mineral hydrogen near by. Research {{in this area is}} still inconclusive in regards to rates of exchange, but it is generally understood that hydrogen exchange complicates the preservation of information in isotope studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{perennial}} {{debate in}} Evanston <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Northwestern University's {{status as a}} tax-exempt institution. In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions, it provides its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and building permit fees, but not property taxes. Northwestern does not make Payments in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls.|$|E

25|$|Females show a {{stronger}} McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> male faces and voices as stimuli {{in comparison to}} female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, {{there is no difference}} in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls {{who have not yet}} entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both {{inside and outside the}} {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E

25|$|One {{of several}} {{issues that have}} risen from the {{controversy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> blood lineage and government records in regards to determining tribal membership. Historians have noted that before the Dawes Commission, the Cherokee have included people from previous rolls and people of non-Cherokee descent {{as members of the}} nation, from former captives to members by adoption. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes, two non-Cherokee tribes, are members of the Cherokee Nation via the Delaware Agreement of 1867 and the Shawnee Agreement of 1869. Another issue is that of a tribe's breaking a treaty protected by Article Six of the United States Constitution. Daniel F. Littlefield Jr., director of the Sequoyah Research Center at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, stated that the Treaty of 1866 granted freedmen their rights as citizens, and the case should not be made into a racial issue.|$|E
500|$|According to U.S. News & World Report, Romm {{believes}} {{that global warming}} [...] "is advancing more swiftly than most people think and than the mainstream media usually report. [...] He has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology, halting {{the construction of new}} coal plants, rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies, and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions". [...] In 2006, in a radio interview, Romm stated, [...] "Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives. [...] If we don't act pretty soon, in an intelligent fashion, then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate... global warming <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the century". [...] In March 2009, Romm summarized and updated his views in an [...] "introduction" [...] to his blog, and in another post, setting forth a summary of [...] "global warming impacts".|$|E
500|$|The {{first problem}} of {{measuring}} unpaid work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> collecting accurate information. This {{is always a}} concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. [...] "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [...] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great," [...] and may {{not take into account}} multitasking [...] for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. Participant observation has been criticized for being [...] "so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households," [...] and thus limited in the amount of information {{it can be used to}} gather.|$|E

500|$|The {{prominent}} narrative {{theme of}} the Tales series <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> coexistence between different races. A particular {{example of this is}} Tales of Rebirth, which extensively explores themes of racism. Scenario writer Hiramatsu Masaki was inspired by the ethnic conflicts seen in Yugoslavia. Another recurring feature is the plot and characters, which are often rooted in and revolve around themes such as justice or faith. The theme for each entry in the series is decided by the series producer based on current world events. The chosen theme helps dictate what the game will be called: once the theme is decided, the team search through various languages to find a suitable representative word. The narratives of each story were described by Gamasutra as [...] "very typical" [...] during a 2008 interview with staff members, although it was not elaborated upon by the interviewer. The interviewers suggested that this point of view was {{based on the fact that}} western fans were not generally experienced in Japanese culture, and so would see the stories in each entry as similar. The writers for each game are hired on a per-project basis, with both freelancers and in-house story writers being involved. Two of the recurring writers are Takumi Miyajima (Symphonia and Abyss), and Naoki Yamamoto (Hearts, Xillia, Zestiria). There are very few mainline games that share a setting: Symphonia takes place along the same [...] "time axis" [...] as Phantasia, while Zestiria and Berseria take place on the same world at different time periods.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account}} the interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E

According to Rejaul Laskar, an Indian expert on international relations, [...] "India's position on Iran's nuclear programme has been consistent, principled and balanced, and makes an endeavour to reconcile Iran's quest for energy security with the international community's concerns on proliferation. So, while India acknowledges and supports Iran's ambitions to achieve energy security and in particular, its quest for peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is also India's principled position that Iran must meet all its obligations under the international law, particularly its obligations under the nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other such treaties {{to which it is}} a signatory" ...|$|E
