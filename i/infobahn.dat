50|$|New Media Age {{is owned}} by Centaur Media plc. It was {{launched}} as a newsletter in May 1995 under editor Phil Dwyer with reporters Nick Jones and Catherine Stewart. They worked together in Centaur's newsletter's division and conceived the idea in 1994 Once considered title for the publication was <b>InfoBahn.</b> They were joined by freelancer Julianna Koranteng. They were joined by Mike Butcher in 1996, who subsequently became Deputy Editor under Dwyer. In 1998, Mike Butcher took over as editor, when Dwyer, Jones and Stewart left to start the European operation of Jupiter Research. Later that year, the title moved to a magazine format. Butcher resigned in 2000 to join The Industry Standard Europe. He was replaced by Michael Nutley in 2000. In 2007, Nutley became editor-in-chief, and Justin Pearse was promoted from deputy editor to editor. The current news editor is Will Cooper and the features editor is Anna Richardson. The publisher is Andy Oakes.|$|E

Unfortunately, however, that means they are also over used, abused, and under defined because we are in such an early stage. I can share some ideas with you about what this thing is, {{what some of the}} real thinking going on in terms of what is driving the creation and definition of an information highway, what it might look like, what are the roles of the players who will need to work to make this thing be. So that is kind of the road map for our highway...|$|E

This series of conferences continues to serve as a unique medium for the exchange of information on topics relating to the ingestion and management of substantial amounts of data and the attendant problems involved. This year's discussion topics include new storage technology, stability of recorded media, performance studies, storage system solutions, the National Information infrastructure (<b>Infobahn),</b> the future for storage technology, and lessons learned from various projects. There also will be an update on the IEEE Mass Storage System Reference Model Version 5, on which the final vote was taken in July 1994...|$|E
40|$|The {{miniaturization}} of electronics, the commodification of information, and {{the growing}} domination of communications technology have created a culture characterized by a compressed sense of time and space. In this realm, technology allows immediate contact with people anywhere around the globe. Computers and smartphones collapse multiple geographies into one, {{with a touch of}} a button, by allowing real-time communication from any place. In this Age of the <b>Infobahn,</b> there are no physical buildings, landscapes, or bodies of water. Residents are likely to be avatars (digital representations of a people) whose sense of continuity and belonging is derived from being networked to the widely scattered people and places they care about. Functions that were once served by architecture, furniture, and fixed equipment are now shifting to portable devices. Places are constructed with bits (of information) and electronic glue. ^ Although making places for human habitation long has been the domain of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners, the realm of cyberspace does not yet utilize the theories, experiences, and practices that have guided the design of physical spaces for centuries. Just as {{there is a need for}} public parks and squares to be pleasant and welcoming to a diverse population in order to function effectively, so must the interfaces and places in cyberspace be. Just as there are architecturally significant places in the physical world, there also must be significant places in the virtual world. Thus, architectural frameworks are important for facilitating functional, enduring, and aesthetically pleasing virtual places where real people may interact with each other and with the place. This dissertation explores the similarities and differences of physical and virtual placemaking, and the extent to which the approach may impact the learning experience for students and/or the shape of learning spaces in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{project is}} {{undertaken}} through a creative works process, {{culminating in a}} series of experiments produced during candidature, polyphonically named Open Limit; field as witness. A polyphonous textual, folding practice and critical engagements, the textual investigates in ways that refuse writing as commentary on practice or practice as counter-point of theoretical plaeaus. The PhD ‘dissertation’ is presented as an active processual encounter where sound and image fuse, and in this refuses an orthodox containment of research to the stasis of the book, or to the geo-fixity of an exhibition architecture. “ [...] . Language is a virus, oooooo” — Laurie Anderson, O' Superman (1981) Desert: Untitled (2011 - 13) is the latest {{in a series of}} prescribed investigations, born out of the performative uncanny in which the human body — with its psychic drives and physical thresholds — is exposed to actual site energies, inspired by John Cage's description, as the telepathic in live media. Unfolding across a series of geographical realities (ice, deep sea, desert), over the span of three years, the work explores site as an entity with its own psychology and momentum (wind, temperature, seismic, sonic), introducing the notion of a subtle alchemy: field as witness. This is an intro-ducting into different kinds of analog and networked situations in which an audience and a site's energies are in play, fusing more with the contemporary environment in the moment. Within a dynamic sense of standing -in, -with or -among remote and local energies, I invite viewers to access a living presence within their own improvisational moves. Remote frequencies become a kind of character study, suggesting a porosity, awaiting entry and passage, as well as the 'wide open,' as an endless metaphor for field. Each geographical circumstance has its own field of intensity. This idea of a site voicing is formulated in relationship to the increased complexity and intensification of a field witnessing, prompting more intricate forms of site development. Exploring forces in live performance, the desert coordinate, takes this principle as a governing sensibility. In this sense, Desert: Untitled, is a live field study excerpt of Open Limit: Field as Witness. In my research trajectory, Open Limit has developed a more recognizable character, that is, a vision and voice that fuses endurance in live-site performance, and incorporates ‘physicalized’ projections and sometimes text. I regard it as participatory—a ‘brew’ inhabiting the live-worlds and traditions of the public art and witnessing sphere, but thickened with cross-pollinating performative disciplines — film, sound, theatre and live media — that help weave a context for developing a system of activated viewing. The desert coordinate is the culmination of three years of research expeditions (geo- psi- tele-) in which a fundamental questioning of ‘encounter’ thematically explores the performative nature of site/nonsite – narrative/non-narrative. I use the notion of activated-cinema to give a name to this inter-relating of media structures. Each site position is ‘blocked out’ as one might block out a location for performance: Desert: Untitled on site field study Scene Block: White Sands New Mexico (long takes – fixed camera) Time/Space: Sunrise–Sunset Local/Global: WGS 84 32 ° 30 ′ 2. 52 ″ N, 106 ° 36 ′ 30. 96 ″ W 32. 5007,- 106. 6086,UTM 13 S 348882 35970 Algo-cinematic performance involves an open non-linear, activated, transitional system (if [...] . then else-operation). Cinematic and telematic sequences are shot on location and triggered by proximity-based sensors as viewers move. Creative interference in actual networked situations, feedback as ‘actants,’ energetics entangle with site. An intermixing, generative sensation of field is recorded through a series of performances that like geometry live algo-cinema describe a liminal space that doesn’t exits in real space but only in an idea of perfect space. Or like swarming molecules, describe an invisible realm that is real, and yet, is the smallest representation of a chemical reaction. Open Limit: field as witness concerns per-formative forces, considered as frameworks, mappings, skeletons, bodily gestures in real-time and in virtual time. Open Limit structures its engagements as three plateaus of encounter: situation; on, condition; liminal, and production; pulse, punctuated by (;) a parallel post-studio work flow. Modality, what I think of as modifiable and modulated, is an intermingling of a telepathic performative continuum—remote site, performance, live-cast. As a new critique on activated performance, Open Limit: field as witness explores just how these tele-pathies, these persuasive signals incite participation and illuminate nuances of another kind of fleeting and conditional dimension. The critical discussions reference the writings of artists: John Cage, Robert Smithson, Roy Ascott and Samuel Beckett among others in an attuning discussion to something essential in questioning aurality itself, visuality and the phenomenal. Critical engagements open to philosophies of immanence, particularly with the writings of Giorgio Agamben, Michel Serres, Brian Massumi, Slavoj Žižek and Gilles Deleuze, but also the work of Douglas Kahn and other media and dramatic theorists. The modalities of the works and their tonal resonances discern a moving from observed phenomena to participating subjects, from observed sites to observing systems. This is a swarming, on-air streaming— a zero vanishing point where the <b>Infobahn</b> is a ‘reflective' operating system, a no-man's-land, connecting the full sensorium—earth/atmosphere/media/human—becoming geo-morpho-psi-genetics. Between televisual/performance/sonic and environmental networking, the ‘work’ is an (in) substantial pulsing — interval — imperceptibly ‘airing. ...|$|E
