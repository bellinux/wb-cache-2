40|$|Several {{strains of}} Bacillus thuringiensis were {{previously}} isolated from soil in Antarctica {{and appeared to}} have physiological adaptations to this cold, nutrient-poor environment. In spite of this they could produce abnormally large, parasporal crystals under laboratory conditions. Here, they have been further characterised for toxin genes and <b>invertebrate</b> <b>pathogenicity.</b> All of the strains were positive in PCR assays for the cry 1 Aa and cry 2 genes. This was confirmed by sequence analysis and the parasporal crystals of all strains contained polypeptides of about 130 kDa. This potential for lepidopteran toxicity was borne out in bioassays of purified d-endotoxins against larvae of Pieris brassicae: the LD 50 values of B 2408 (288 lg) were {{comparable to that of}} the reference strain, HD- 12 (201 lg). There was no activity against the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{in spite of the fact}} that all strains appeared to possess the cry 6 gene. PCR screening for genes encoding other nematode-toxic classes of toxins (Cry 5, 4 and 21) was negative. B. thuringiensis has never previously been shown to be toxic to Collembola (springtails) but the purified dendotoxins of one of the Antarctic strains showed some activity against Folsomia candida and Seira domestica (224 lg and 238 lg, respectively). It seems unlikely that the level of toxicity demonstrated against springtails would support a pathogenic life-style in nature. All of the strains were positive for genes encoding Bacillus cereus-type enterotoxins. In the absence of higher insects and mammals the ecological value of retaining the toxic capability demonstrated here is uncertain...|$|E
