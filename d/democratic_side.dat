5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side</b> of the aisle had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily {{if he were to}} switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though he}} did not pursue or seek out elected office, Sprigg was {{repeatedly}} called upon to run for office by the West Virginia Democratic Party. After his term as attorney general, he was elected to several terms as mayor of Moorefield. In 1888, despite his protest before the Democratic Party state convention, he was nominated to run for a seat in West Virginia House of Delegates representing the Second Delegate District, which consisted of Grant and Hardy counties. He was elected following a highly contested campaign and served for the 1889 legislative session. During his tenure, Sprigg served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was initially a candidate for Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Also in 1888, Sprigg was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. To resolve the disputed results of the 1888 gubernatorial election between Aretas B. Fleming and Nathan Goff, Jr., Sprigg was appointed in April 1889 as secretary of a joint committee of the West Virginia Legislature charged with investigating and deciding the results of the election. While serving on the committee, he was a dominant spokesman for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side</b> in support of Fleming, who was ultimately chosen as the winner of the election.|$|E

25|$|A US Census in 2006 {{reported}} that the population of New Hampshire was 1,314,895. 356,897 did not declare a party affiliation. These independent voters make up 44 percent of the New Hampshire electorate and could have voted in either the Democratic primary or the Republican Party's primary, but couldn't have voted in both. Democratic voters made up a smaller proportion. 216,005 people have registered as a Democrat. These statistics are important because in 2004, the New Hampshire independents leaned towards the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side</b> in favor of then-candidate John Kerry. Since then, New Hampshire has become more Democratic, replacing their Republican governor and state legislature with a government led by Democratic politicians. However, the people of New Hampshire are divided into several smaller regions, so the entire state as a whole wouldn't {{have been expected to}} act in a uniform manner.|$|E
25|$|In the South, political–racial {{tensions}} {{built up}} inside the Republican party as they were attacked by the Democrats. In 1868, Georgia Democrats, with support from some Republicans, expelled all 28 black Republican members from the state house, arguing blacks were eligible to vote but not to hold office. In most states, the more conservative scalawags fought for control with the more radical carpetbaggers and their black allies. Most of the 430 Republican newspapers in the South were edited by scalawags – only 20 percent were edited by carpetbaggers. White businessmen generally boycotted Republican papers, which survived through government patronage. Nevertheless, in the increasingly bitter battles inside the Republican Party, the scalawags usually lost; many of the disgruntled losers switched over to the conservative or <b>Democratic</b> <b>side.</b> In Mississippi, the conservative faction led by scalawag James Lusk Alcorn was decisively defeated by the radical faction led by carpetbagger Adelbert Ames. The party lost support steadily as many scalawags left it; few recruits were acquired. The most bitter contest took place inside the Republican Party in Arkansas, where the two sides armed their forces and confronted {{each other in the}} streets; no actual combat took place in the Brooks–Baxter War. The carpetbagger faction led by Elisha Baxter finally prevailed when the White House intervened, but both sides were badly weakened, and the Democrats soon came to power.|$|E
500|$|A myth {{has arisen}} that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896. This {{was not the}} case; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions.

As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses, Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side</b> of the House.

At a May 13 event in Nevada, Bush further said [...] "...if we're going to get into hypotheticals I think it does a disservice {{for a lot of people}} that sacrificed a lot."

500|$|The 1953 Republican primary for all offices, {{including}} Controller, {{was complicated}} by a {{split in the}} party hierarchy between the [...] "regular" [...] faction, led by Hamilton and Board of Revision of Taxes President William F.

In the end, Foster A. Dunlap, a local attorney and the Hamilton-Meade candidate, won with 66,557 votes. Meehan's candidate, former Deputy Secretary of Supplies and Services Wilhelm F. Knauer, polled 50,185, and Gibson's running mate, Rudolph F. Price, tallied just 4,566.

500|$|As the {{election}} of 1880 drew near, Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate. [...] Hayes had pledged himself to a one-term presidency, which meant the Republicans {{would not have the}} advantage of incumbency. [...] On the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> Tilden was regarded as the natural choice, as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876. [...] Tilden's supporters saw Bayard as a rival, and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876. [...] Meanwhile, in the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. In fact, the Potter committee's investigation had the opposite effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. [...] The telegrams doomed Tilden's hopes for the nomination, and boosted Bayard's chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters.|$|E
500|$|Strategists {{from both}} parties viewed {{the outcome of the}} race as a [...] "referendum on President Obama's {{handling}} of the economy". Chairman Michael Steele of the Republican National Committee said the special election was the first of three elections that were [...] "incredibly important" [...] for the Republicans to win. The Republican leadership made this race a top priority, and Chairman Steele, former Governor George Pataki, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich helped Tedisco with fundraising. Steele visited the district twice. On the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> Senator Gillibrand appeared in commercials and robocalls for Murphy, and Senator Chuck Schumer helped Murphy's campaign with fundraising. Less than a week before the election, President Obama formally endorsed Murphy in a mass email to supporters and urged supporters to organize and vote for Murphy. A radio ad Vice President Joe Biden recorded for Murphy was released on March 25. That same day, Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tim Kaine emailed 500 of the party's top donors asking them to contribute to Murphy's campaign.|$|E

40|$|The {{referendum}} {{debate is}} not {{living up to}} its <b>democratic</b> ideals. Both <b>sides</b> of the divide have focused heavily on negative, fear-based arguments to make their case, which prevent democratic engagement among the electorate.

500|$|The {{resolution}} {{was brought to}} the House floor on June7, 1924, when Luce asked that the House pass the legislation. [...] He had alluded in his report to the well-known Ralph Waldo Emerson poem [...] "Concord Hymn" [...] by including the phrase [...] "embattled farmers", a reference which Arkansas's Otis Wingo used as an excuse to deliver a lengthy speech on tariffs, accusing the Republican majority of harming the farmer. [...] Once Wingo had finished to applause from the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> the House passed the bill without a recorded vote, with Rogers presiding over the House {{in the absence of the}} Speaker. The {{resolution was}} transmitted to the Senate the same day and was referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee. On January5, 1925, the resolution was reported back to the Senate by Wyoming's Francis Warren, unamended, with the recommendation that it pass. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas asked for the amount of the appropriation being made in the bill, and when told it was $15,000, had no additional questions.

2500|$|After Indian {{independence}} {{and until the}} end of the Cold War, the relationship between the US and India was cold and often thorny. This was due to the closeness of the US towards India's arch-rival Pakistan during the War, with Pakistan joining the US-led Western Bloc in 1954. India's policy of being not aligned with either the US or the Soviet Union, but maintaining close ties with the latter, also impacted relations. American officials perceived India's policy of non-alignment negatively. Ambassador Henry F. Grady told then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the United States did not consider neutrality to be an acceptable position.

2500|$|Another scholar {{contends that}} the {{minority}} leader position emerged even before 1883. On the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> [...] "there were serious caucus fights for the minority speakership nomination in 1871 and 1873," [...] indicating that the [...] "nomination carried with it some vestige of leadership." [...] Further, when Republicans were in the minority, the party nominated for Speaker a series of prominent lawmakers, including ex-Speaker James Blaine of Maine in 1875, former Appropriations Chairman James A. Garfield of Ohio, in 1876, 1877, and 1879, and ex-Speaker Keifer in 1883. [...] "It {{is hard to believe}} that House partisans would place a man in the speakership when in the majority, and nominate him for this office when in the minority, and not look to him for legislative guidance."

2500|$|Dissatisfaction on {{the part}} of the growing middle class with the {{corruption}} and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the 1890s. In every major city and state, and at the national level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change. Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert La Follette on the Republican side, and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson on the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side,</b> took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage, prohibition, and better schools; their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago, who created settlement houses. [...] "Muckraking" [...] journalists such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty. Progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments– the Sixteenth through Nineteenth– resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and woman suffrage. The Progressive Movement lasted through the 1920s; the most active period was 1900–18.|$|E
2500|$|Congressional leaders {{moved to}} resolve the crisis by {{creating}} a 15-member Electoral Commission on January 25, 1877, which was empowered to determine which set of votes were valid. The Commission consisted of five members from the Republican-controlled Senate (three Republicans and two Democrats), and five from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives (three Democrats, two Republicans). The remaining five members were chosen from the Supreme Court – originally two Republicans, two Democrats, and independent Justice David Davis. Davis, however, {{was elected to the}} US Senate from Illinois, resigned from the Court and turned down the commission appointment. (Ironically, the election of Davis was the brainchild of Tilden's nephew who assumed it would secure his commission vote for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>side.)</b> Justice Joseph P. Bradley, a Republican, was named to replace Davis. The Commission voted 8–7 along party lines to award all the votes to Hayes. Some Democrats threatened to filibuster in the Senate to prevent the electoral votes from being counted, but were dissuaded. Part of resolving the election dispute was the Compromise of 1877, whereby the Democrats agreed to Hayes's election and he agreed to complete the withdrawal of federal troops in the South which had begun during the Ulysses S. Grant administration, bringing an end to Republican Reconstruction in the South. The Compromise of 1877 was in line with views that Hayes had already expressed; in his letter accepting the Republican nomination, he had indicated his desire that the South enjoy [...] "the blessings of honest and capable local government" [...] (but only with guarantees that the states would guard the civil rights of the freedmen).|$|E
