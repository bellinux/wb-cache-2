25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket internal combustion engine (ICE) motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles. These include both four-stroke and two-stroke gasoline engine designs. Among these, Golden Eagle Bike Engines currently produces a rear-engine (rack-mounted) kit using a belt to drive the rear wheel. Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (<b>friction</b> <b>drive)</b> or a chain-driven, geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke gas engines mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or chain-driven transmissions and final drives. Some of these brands include Jiangdu Flying Horse Gasoline Engine Factory Ltd., EZ Motorbike Company, Inc., Mega Motors Inc., and Grubee Inc.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the American bolt-on Whizzer gas-engined bicycle kit was introduced, {{utilizing}} a 138cc side-valve four-stroke engine, the first whizzer {{was of the}} <b>friction</b> <b>drive</b> variety, but was soon replaced with belt drive. Despite some initial engine reliability issues, the Whizzer enjoyed modest popularity during World War II due to fuel and automobile shortages, and was used by war plant workers and others with priority for transportation. After the war, the Whizzer became popular with youth who desired faster speeds from their heavy cruiser-framed Schwinn bicycles. In 1949, the company introduced a complete production bike, the Pacemaker. Sales of the Whizzer conversion kits continued until 1962. In the United Kingdom, the motorized bicycle saw a resurgence of popularity and such bolt-on motors as the Cyclaid and the Cyclemaster motor wheel saw brief periods of immense popularity. The Cyclemaster, which was a hub motor that could be fitted to an ordinary bike, started at 25cc (painted black), but later the size went up to 32cc (painted grey).|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in Europe the {{motorized}} bicycle {{continued to}} be popular, particularly in France and Italy. An Italian manufacturer, Vincenti Piatti, designed a 50cc engine for driving portable lathes and this was also used to power a bicycle frame {{in the form of}} the Mini Motore. Piatti later licensed the design to Trojan for production in Britain as the Trojan Minimotor. In West Germany, a compression-ignition (diesel) engine kit using an 18cc variable head engine made by Lohmann was produced during the 1950s. In France, where postwar reconstruction, taxes, and fuel shortages limited automobile access, motorized bicycle kits and complete models were produced by a variety of smaller manufacturers, often using a two-stroke gasoline engine mounted above the front wheel. In 1946, production of the very successful French VELOSOLEX commenced, continuing until 1988. The VéloSoleX was a mass-produced motorized bicycle that used a tire roller (<b>friction</b> <b>drive)</b> to the front wheel. After French production ceased, the VELOSOLEX {{continued to be}} produced in China and Hungary. An in-wheel gasoline engine was used on the Honda P50 moped, which ceased production in 1968. The velomoteur and motor scooter enjoyed a second renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s as a new generation of youth discovered they could ride a motorized vehicle without need of a driver's license. Other countries had relaxed licensing requirements, e.g. lower age limits for motorized bicycles, which increased their popularity.|$|E

A two degree-of-freedom dynamic model with one unilateral frictional contact is built for one of the <b>friction</b> <b>driven</b> structures. Different contact regimes and the transitions between them are identified and analyzed. Numerical simulations are conducted to find out different operation modes of the system concerning the sequence of contact regimes in one steady state period. The influences of parameters on the operation modes and corresponding steady state characteristics are also explored.

40|$|Harmonic drives are {{increasingly}} used in precision positioning {{applications such as}} military radars, wafer handling machines, and satellite cameras. Precision tracking performance of these drives is deteriorated by nonlinear transmission attributes including kinematic error, flexibility, hysteresis and friction. Hence characterization and compensation of these nonlinear attributes is crucial to improve the precision in tracking and regulation. This paper focuses on modeling, identification, and compensation of nonlinear <b>friction</b> in harmonic <b>drives.</b> Harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>friction</b> models presented in the literature {{are found to be}} a combination of Coulomb and viscous friction. However, a dynamic friction phenomenon exhibits, in addition to Coulomb and viscous frictions, other nonlinear phenomena including the Dahl effect, and the Stribeck effect which must be considered in an accurate friction model. In addition, in this research, harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>friction</b> is discovered to be dependent on the motor position. Complete characterization of <b>friction</b> in harmonic <b>drives</b> is carried out in this paper by using a recently developed LuGre (Lund-Grenobel) friction model superimposed with a new posit ion-dependent part.
