5|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{prior to this}} time is largely {{the history of the}} ruling aristocracy. From now on the {{ordinary}} people <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> greater clarity. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves comunitas Orcadie and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} that the race was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, an increasing number of immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|Workers first emerge between May and July. During {{this first}} emergence, {{reproductive}} males also <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> this first brood and {{are called the}} early males. These males provide a great adaptation because they allow {{for the presence of}} reproductive males. Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers, cells, pupae, and emergences. Although it is uncertain as to why, queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans, most frequently in May. The majority of original queens are dead by July, “well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid,” as reproductives emerged from late August through September. Thus, queens must remain alive post June in order to birth future reproductives, and if they are not able to do so, the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen. The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary biology as an {{academic}} discipline <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s.

25|$|A {{new trend}} for the RCM would <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> {{the design of}} the numismatic three cent coin. The three cent coin was {{packaged}} in a coin and stamp set as part of a joint venture with Canada Post. This partnership would lead to another ten coin and stamp sets in the decade. An additional trend that emerged was the RCM's commitment to military and Olympic coins as well.|$|E

25|$|The second general {{characteristic}} of Pachypodium is spinescence, or having spines. The spines come clustered in either pairs or triplets with these clusters often arranged in rings or whorls around the trunk. Spines <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> leaves, and like leaves grow {{for a short}} period before stopping growth and hardening. Spines do not regenerate so weathering and abrasion can wear away all but the youngest spines from older specimens - leaving smooth trunks and branches.|$|E
25|$|Each voter is {{entitled}} to one vote each {{for the duration of}} the election. The voter may split his or her ticket. The candidate with the most votes wins the position; there is no run-off election, and the president and vice president may come from different parties. If two or more candidates <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> an equal and highest number of votes, one of them will be elected by the Senate and the House of Representatives, voting separately.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{political}} parties in Tuvalu. During his term as prime minister Sapoanga had a shifting alliance of MPs who supported him, {{and there was also}} an opposition group against him. Both Sapoanga's group and the opposition group were plagued by defections; a series of by-elections also created uncertainty as to which side would <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> a parliamentary majority. The survival of his government has been described as resulting from his dexterous handling of the distribution of ministerial and other appointments.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1827, Church {{appointed}} Gordon director-general of the army. He probably {{continued to}} serve in this capacity until the Greek defeat of 6 May. Nevertheless, continued resistance, {{the success of the}} Battle of Navarino, and the backing of France, the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland enabled the Kingdom of Greece to <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> a northern frontier from Arta to Volos, but without Crete or Samos. In July 1827, Gordon returned to Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Peabody took Junius Spencer Morgan (father of J. P.

25|$|There {{has been}} an {{academic}} debate about how social media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists Brian Loader and Dan Mercea give an overview of this discussion: They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations' political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.|$|E

25|$|The {{principles}} of evolutionary educational psychology represent the foundational assumptions for an evolutionary educational psychology. The gist is knowledge and expertise that {{is useful in}} the cultural milieu or ecology in which the group is situated will be transferred across generations {{in the form of}} cultural artifacts, such as books, or learning traditions, as in apprenticeships (e.g., Baumeister, 2005; Richerson & Boyd, 2005; Flinn, 1997; Mithen, 1996). Across generations, the store of cultural knowledge accumulates and creates a gap between this knowledge base and the forms of folk knowledge and abilities that epigenetically <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> children’s self-initiated activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{length of}} the mite's cycle depends on species and {{environment}} but normally lasts two to 12 months. The number of cycles in a year depends on the region. For example, in a temperate region, there might only be three per year, but in tropical regions the cycle might be continuous all year long. Adult harvest mites overwinter in protected places such as slightly below the soil. Females become active in the spring, and once the ground temperature is regularly above , she lays eggs in vegetation, up to 15 eggs per day. The eggs are round and are dormant for about six days, after which the nonfeeding prelarvae <b>emerge,</b> <b>with</b> only three pairs of legs. After about six days, the prelarva grows into its larval stage.|$|E
25|$|The victories, however, {{proved to}} be {{something}} of a false dawn as, over the space of five days in September, an injury-hit Ireland dropped five points from two games and saw their qualifying campaign effectively come to an end. Leading 2–1 away to Slovakia the team would <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> just one point after an injury-time strike from Marek Cech cancelled their advantage. Staunton was disappointed by the performance but four days later, on 12 September, a 1–0 defeat to the Czech Republic in Prague crippled the qualifying campaign. A 0–0 draw with Germany on 13 October at Croke Park and a 1–1 draw at home to Cyprus in the same stadium four days later (during which a chorus of boos greeted the final whistle) secured qualification for both Germany and the Czech Republic. Ireland would not be competing in the 2008 European Championship.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1995 the German {{aerospace}} and defence company DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) and its British counterpart British Aerospace {{were said to}} be eager to create a transnational aerospace and defence company. The two companies envisaged including the French company Aérospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation. The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, Aérospatiale and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA into an integrated company; in this aim BAe and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale. As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the Panavia Tornado and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with Matra and <b>emerge</b> <b>with</b> a diluted French government shareholding. A merger was agreed between British Aerospace Chairman Richard Evans and DASA CEO Jürgen Schrempp in December 1998. However, when the British General Electric Company put its defence electronics business Marconi Electronic Systems (MES) up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES to form BAE Systems was announced on 19 January 1999 and completed on 30 November. Evans stated in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.|$|E
