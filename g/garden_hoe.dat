2500|$|The {{universal}} {{currency in}} Kongo {{and just about}} all of Central Africa was shell money known locally as nzimbu. One hundred nzimbu could purchase a hen; 300 a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe</b> and 2000 a goat. Slaves, which were always a part of Kongo's economy but increased in trade after contact with Portugal were also bought in nzimbu. A female slave could be purchased (or sold) for 20,000 nzimbu and male slave for 30,000. Nzimbu shells were collected from the island of Luanda and kept as a royal monopoly. The smaller shells were filtered out so that only the large shells entered the marketplace as currency. The Kongo would not trade for gold or silver, but nzimbu shells, often put in pots in special increments, could buy anything. Kongo's [...] "money pots" [...] held increments of 40, 100, 250, 400, and 500. For especially large purchases, there were standardized units such as a funda (1,000 big shells), Lufuku (10,000 big shells) and a kofo (20,000 big shells).|$|E

5000|$|On Ash Wednesday (March 1) 2017, Dowling {{was arrested}} with fellow Catholic Worker activists for {{removing}} a sword from a Cross of Sacrifice at the Toowong War Memorial and beating {{it into the}} shape of a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe</b> (plowshare).|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{farming and}} <b>gardening</b> <b>hoe</b> with a heavy, broad blade and a {{straight}} edge {{is known as the}} Italian hoe, grub hoe, grab hoe, pattern hoe, Azada, or dago hoe ("dago" [...] is an ethnic slur referring to Italians, Spaniards, or Portuguese).|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} phases within the {{contemporaneous}} Fort Ancient Tradition, local freshwater shell {{was used for}} tools and jewelry. Animal bone and shell were used for <b>garden</b> <b>hoes.</b> Animal bone was shaped for use as tools. These included awls, punches, fish hooks, bone needles, and hide scrapers. Animal bone artifacts included beads, hair pins, pendants, and tinklers. The vertebrate fauna at Hobson was dominated by deer and turkey but also included raccoon, elk, fish, and turtle.|$|R
50|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the term}} hoecake first occurs in 1745, and {{the term is}} used by American writers such as Joel Barlow and Washington Irving. The origin of the name is the method of preparation: they were cooked on a type of iron pan called a hoe. There is {{conflicting}} evidence regarding the common belief that they were cooked on the blades of <b>gardening</b> <b>hoes.</b> A hoecake can be made either out of cornbread batter or leftover biscuit dough. A cornbread hoecake is thicker than a cornbread pancake.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 July 2006, Gulpilil {{was staying}} {{at the home of}} Vaughan Williams in Darwin, when an {{argument}} started over his drinking (Williams' home had a [...] "no alcohol policy"). [...] Williams asked Gulpilil, his wife and their friend (referred to as [...] "JJ") to leave his home. During the argument, Williams and his friend allegedly armed themselves with a totem pole and a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe.</b> In response, Gulpilil produced a machete.|$|E
50|$|Jimmy {{is taken}} away by police. Racked with guilt, Ralph has pot-induced {{hallucinations}} {{of the children who}} got hooked on the Reefer Gangs dope as the living dead. Ralph gets an extreme case of the munchies and cannibalizes Sally. Jack shoots Ralph to stop him ("Murder!"). Seeing similar visions, Mae realizes the error of her ways and tells Jack to do the same. He rejects her pleas and she bludgeons him to death with a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe,</b> gaining her much-needed empowerment ("The Stuff (Reprise)").|$|E
5000|$|The Mammoty's blade {{is about}} four times {{as large as the}} average <b>garden</b> <b>hoe.</b> It is the {{gardening}} implement of choice in these countries. Its name, [...] "mammoty" [...] comes from the word [...] "Man Vetty" [...] ("Man" [...] rhymes with [...] "one") in Tamil, a language spoken in Tamil Nadu in India and some northern parts of Sri Lanka. In the Sinhala language, it is called [...] Udalla [...] [...] "Mann" [...] in Tamil, language means earth or soil and [...] "Vetti" [...] refers to a cutter. Colloquially it is called as [...] " [...] Mambutty or Mambty [...] ".|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Bad", Jackson and his dancers scream loudly for {{no reason}} at random times. Yankovic parodies this by having a scene where he and his dancers scream [...] "Ho!" [...] every now and then. One of the dancers hands Yankovic a <b>gardening</b> <b>hoe,</b> and Yankovic {{comments}} on it by saying [...] "Hoe!" [...] This also occurs when the song is performed live, though, occasionally, a man in a Santa Claus suit comes on stage and is belly-bumped or, as seen on [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic Live!, punched in the face by Al. In the Straight Outta Lynwood tour, in keeping with the [...] "gangsta" [...] theme of the latest album, the man dressed as Santa was replaced by a man dressed as a promiscuous woman. Al points at the visitor and shouts [...] "Ho!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The freight company soon {{fell behind}} on paying its installments, and on July 12, 1861, McCanles {{arrived at the}} station with his 12-year-old son Monroe (or William Monroe), his cousin James Woods, and another employee, James Gordon, {{demanding}} to see Horace Wellman in order to collect a long-overdue payment. There are several different versions of what happened next. In some versions, McCanles was initially met by Wellman's wife and Hickok at the door, who told him that Wellman was either unavailable or unwilling to meet with him. Other accounts suggest that Wellman himself was present for the confrontation. At some point, either by invitation or by force, McCanles entered the station cabin and argued with the occupants. He was then shot by Hickok, who was hiding behind a curtain. McCanles's son immediately rushed into the building. Woods and Gordon, like McCanles, were unarmed and attempted to flee, but Hickok stepped from the cabin and wounded both with his pistols. The two men were then killed by {{other members of the}} relay station, Gordon by station employee J.W. [...] "Doc" [...] Brink with a shotgun blast and Woods by Horace Wellman (or Wellman's wife), who hacked him to death with a <b>gardening</b> <b>hoe.</b> Hickok was not reported as wounded. During the attack, McCanles' son Monroe was able to escape via a dry creekbed.|$|R
6000|$|But {{they must}} decay very quickly, these roots, {{to leave their}} quite fresh graves thus empty: and--now one thinks of it--how few fallen trees, or even dead sticks, there are about. An English wood, if left to itself, would be cumbered with fallen timber; and one has heard of forests in North America, through which it is all but {{impossible}} to make way, so high are piled up, among the still- growing trees, dead logs in every stage of decay. Such a sight {{may be seen in}} Europe, among the high Silver-fir forests of the Pyrenees. How is it not so here? How indeed? And how comes it--if you will look again--that there are few or no fallen leaves, and actually no leaf-mould? In an English wood there would be a foot-- perhaps two feet--of black soil, renewed by every autumn leaf fall. [...] Two feet? One has heard often enough of bison-hunting in Himalayan forests among Deodaras one hundred and fifty feet high, and scarlet Rhododendrons thirty feet high, growing in fifteen or twenty feet of leaf-and-timber mould. And here, in a forest equally ancient, every plant is growing out of the bare yellow loam, as it might in a well- <b>hoed</b> <b>garden</b> bed. Is it not strange? ...|$|R
50|$|A {{quiet and}} mysterious {{boy with a}} violent past. He is {{actually}} named Sasaki and is a childhood friend of Maimai. He {{was sent to a}} juvenile detention center after stabbing a highschool classmate. The reason he attacked the classmate was because he was suffering from constant bullying and eventually snapped. When Hyōketsu no Judgeness was constantly pestering him about the similar japanese characters in their names and accusing him of copying his name, he attacks him with a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe.</b> The others subdue him and imprison him within a cell the found in the village. However he later escapes and is only seen briefly when most {{of the members of the}} tour try to leave the village.|$|E
5000|$|... "Lila" [...] ‒ {{played by}} Susan Stewart ‒ is a {{seemingly}} good-natured go-go dancer who strips at a seedy topless {{bar on the}} Sunset Strip. After taking LSD, Lila becomes a psychopathic serial killer. She continues to pick up men at the bar where she is employed, but after her sanity is lost she routinely is interrupted mid-coitus by psychedelic bad trips in which she visualizes a balding, half-naked old man clutching wads of cash {{in one hand and}} a bunch of bananas in the other. These psychotic episodes cause her to murder her partners by stabbing them with a screwdriver and dismembering them with a rusty meat cleaver (or in one case, a <b>garden</b> <b>hoe)</b> while imagining that she is cutting up cantaloupes and watermelons.|$|E
50|$|The Walton's {{joined the}} members of the Hole-in-the-Rock {{expedition}} in settling a beautiful valley surrounded by red rock cliffs called Bluff, Utah. There, they build the Bluff Fort and dealt with renegade outlaws and murderous Indians. One Indian Chief named William Posey created the greatest concern for the settlers and was feared by them. On one occasion, Jane Walton had a confrontation with Chief Posey in which he threatened her with his rifle. Without thinking, Jane struck the felonious native with her <b>garden</b> <b>hoe</b> and knocked him unconscious to the ground. Fearing she had killed him, Jane returned to her gardening while she gathered her thoughts. Upon hearing her faithful dog growling, Jane turned {{in time to see the}} Indian chief climbing on his pony with her dog hanging from his britches. He rode off and wasn't heard from for weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Mae decides {{the only}} way to find inner peace is to turn herself in and save Jimmy from the {{electric}} chair. Jack tries to bring Mae back to her senses in his usual fashion - by giving her a smoke. Mae stubs it out. An angry Jack slaps her for wasting [...] "half a jay of good mooter". Mae reacts with cold fury and picks up a hoe from the victory garden. Frightened by Mae's intensity, Jack tries to shoot her - alas, he expended all his bullets on Ralph! Mae sings as she slashes Jack with the <b>garden</b> <b>hoe,</b> avenging the deaths of Sally, Ralph, Mary, and every other poor kid Jack has ever hooked on marijuana ("The Stuff" [...] reprise). Fountains of blood spray over the stage. Finally, Mae runs off to save Jimmy.|$|E
