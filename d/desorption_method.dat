Gas content determination techniques generally fall into two categories: (1) direct methods which actually measure the volume of gas released from a coal sample sealed into a desorption canister and (2) indirect methods based on empirical correlations, or laboratory derived sorption isotherm gas storage capacity data. Direct gas content determination techniques may be further. subdivided into quick-crushing and extended <b>desorption</b> <b>methods.</b> The quick-crushing methods are primarily used in mine safety applications outside the United States, but have also been used for resource recovery applications.

However, some data useful for resource recovery applications are lost. Extended desorption techniques are most commonly used for resource assessment and recovery applications where information on desorption rates is useful for reservoir modeling, and for fundamental coalbed methane research. Extended <b>desorption</b> <b>methods</b> allow the gases in the coal sample to desorb under controlled laboratory conditions until a defined low desorption rate cutoff point is reached.
