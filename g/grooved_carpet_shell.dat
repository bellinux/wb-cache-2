40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the presence of Salmonella spp., verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), Vibrio spp., and Norovirus GI-GII in bivalve molluscs, cockles, and European <b>grooved</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shells</b> (Cerastoderma spp. and Ruditapes decussatus) collected from a class B growing natural bed in Sardinia (Italy). All of the samples were analysed for Salmonella spp. detection according to European Commission Regulation (EC) 2285 / 2015. Detection and enumeration of Vibrio spp. were performed according to previously published methods. Presumptive identification of Vibrio spp. isolates was performed by means of conventional biochemical tests. E. coli VTEC was isolated following a direct multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening test. Norovirus GI and GII were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). No Salmonella spp. were detected. The prevalence of Vibrio spp. was 90 %, and the average contamination levels were 3. 19 ± 1. 07 and 2. 84 ± 0. 31 Log 10 cfu/g in cockles and European <b>grooved</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>shells,</b> respectively. The prevalence of E. coli VTEC was 6. 6 %. All of the isolates showed a complete pathogenicity profile.

Stable isotopes analysis, especially for nitrogen, proved to be a good tool for the study of clam deterioration.

In both cases bacteria isolated in pure culture were inoculated into spat of <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams by intravalvar injection and by immersion. The mortality was attributed to the inoculated strains, since the bacteria were obtained in pure culture from the soft tissues of experimentally infected clams. V. alginolyticus TA 15 and V. splendidus biovar II strain TA 2 caused similar histological lesions that affected mainly the mantle, the velum, and the connective tissue of infected organisms. The general enzymatic activity of both live cells and extracellular products (ECPs), as evaluated by the API ZYM system, revealed that whole bacterial cells showed greater enzymatic activity than ECPs and that the activity of most enzymes ceased after heat treatment (100 °C for 10 min). Both strain TA 15 and strain TA 2 produced hydroxamate siderophores, although the activity was greater in strain TA 15.

The present experimental work represents the first attempt to assess detoxification kinetics of fast-acting toxins (FAT) in marine molluscs fed specific diets of non-toxic algae (Isochrysis galbana). To find an optimal detoxification method, two experiments were performed in which clams were first fed the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia selliformis to artificially contaminate them with GYM, thus simulating the effect of natural toxic episodes.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Grooved</b> <b>Carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam Ruditapes decussatus is the {{autochthonous}} European clam and {{the most}} appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. The production is in decline due to several factors such as Perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. After we sequenced R. decussatus transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to Perkinsiosis. Results A database consisting of 41, 119 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12, 479 (30. 3 %) were annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in R. decussatus heavily infected by Perkinsus olseni. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. As expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. The extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed. Conclusions This study represents a first attempt to characterize Ruditapes decussatus transcriptome, an important marine resource for the European aquaculture. The trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. In this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the Carpet shell clam and Perkinsus, two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction. Ample information was obtained to identify biological processes significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes in Perkinsus infected versus non-infected gills.

Observations showed that for each phycotoxin, the contamination rates are species-dependent {{and the most}} contaminated species differ according {{to the kind of}} phycotoxin.

The DA concentration decreased in cooked cockles and razor clams whereas it increased in cooked mussels, <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams and donax. Thus the impact of cooking is bivalve species-dependent. For OAs and SPX, the cooking process was studied on mussels and resulted in an increase in the toxin concentration because of their lipophilic nature.
