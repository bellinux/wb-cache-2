40|$|Cast {{impingement}} cooling geometries {{offer the}} gas turbine designer higher structural integrity and improved convective cooling {{when compared to}} traditional impingement cooling systems which rely on plate inserts. In this paper, it is shown that the surface which forms the jets contributes significantly to the total cooling. Local heat transfer coefficient distributions have been measured in a model of an engine wall cooling geometry using the transient heat transfer technique. The method employs temperature sensitive liquid crystals to measure the surface temperature of large scale perspex models during transient experiments. Full distributions of local Nusselt number on both surfaces of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate,</b> and on the impingement target plate are presented at engine representative Reynolds numbers. The relative effects of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> thermal boundary condition and the coolant supply temperature on the target plate heat transfer has been determined by maintaining an isothermal boundary condition at the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> during the transient tests.

The experimental study uses a high resolution liquid crystal technique for the determination of the convective heat transfer coefficients on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> The heat transfer experiments are performed using a transient heat transfer method. The mean flow and the character of turbulent flow in the free jet is presented through five hole probe and hot wire measurements, respectively. The flow field character of the region near the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> {{plays an important role in}} the amount of convective heat transfer. Detailed surveys obtained from five hole probe and hot wire measurements are provided. An extensive validation of the liquid crystal based heat transfer method against a conventional technique is also presented. After a complete documentation of the mean and turbulent flow field, the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> are presented. The near wall of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> and the free jet region is treated separately. The current heat transfer distributions are compared to other studies available from the literature. The present paper contains complete sets of information on the three dimensional mean flow, turbulent velocity fluctuations, and convective heat transfer to the plate.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to investigate the thermal performances of woks fabricated from materials with different thermal conductivities and surface emissivities. A pre-mixed air/butane flame impinged vertically upwards upon a flat impingement-plate's (to simulate the wok's flat-bottom) surface under laminar-flow conditions. The operation parameters of the premixed flame were kept constant (i. e., Reynolds number = 1200; equivalence ratio = 1; and nozzle-to-plate distance = 5). In order to {{examine the effect of}} conduction, three materials, namely red brass (k = 61 W/mK), bronze (k = 26 W/mK) and stainless steel (k = 14. 9 W/mK), were considered. Because of the lower thermal-conductivity and hence higher conduction-resistance, a significantly lower heat-flux would ensue over the stagnation region for the stainless-steel wok. However, {{there were no significant differences}} in the heat-flux distributions in the wall-jet regions for the stainless-steel, bronze and red-brass <b>impingement</b> <b>plates.</b> To examine the effects of radiation, three red-brass <b>impingement</b> <b>plates</b> with surface-emissivities of either 0. 1, 0. 38 or 0. 98 were tested experimentally.

The present work addresses <b>impingement</b> air cooled <b>plate</b> fin heat sinks for electronic components. Simple impingement flow pressure drop and thermal resistance models based on developing laminar flow in rectangular channels are proposed. Both models are constituted from simple momentum and energy balances and utilize fundamental solutions from heat transfer and fluid dynamics to predict their constitutive components. To test {{the validity of the}} models' predictions, experimental measurements of pressure drop and thermal resistance are performed with heat sinks of various impingement inlet widths, fin spacings, fin heights and flow velocities. The models are expected to achieve accuracies within 20 % for pressure drop and within 20 % for thermal resistance at channel Reynolds numbers less than 1200.

40|$|The {{combination}} of roughness elements with an impingement cooling systems offers an attractive means of achieving high heat transfer. Considerable {{care must be}} taken to choose the shape, size and the position of the roughness elements to maximise heat transfer and minimise pressure loss. In the last decade, many studies have been investigated the effect of changes in many of the geometric features, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the effect of the inevitable fillet. Blades and vanes are normally manufactured by casting so the fillet radius is unavoidable. The present paper investigates the effect of roughness element fillet radii on heat transfer enhancement in an impingement cooling system. Three configurations with streamwise ribs were studied. The streamwise ribs are all trapezoidal in cross section. In the three configurations the fillet radii are (1) 0 mm (sharp-edged), (2) 3 mm, and (3) 5 mm. The extra heat transfer area of the sharp-edged, 3 mm fillet and the 5 mm fillet rib configurations are reported. Two-staggered arrays (a uniform and non-uniform hole diameter array) of <b>impingement</b> <b>plates</b> are used. The jets from odd numbered rows impinge between the ribs while the jets from even numbered rows impinge onto the ribs. Tests were conducted at three different mass flow rates for each configuration. The average and local jet Reynolds numbers varied between 21500 and 31500, and 17000 and 41000 respectively. The transient liquid crystal technique was used to produce detailed Nusselt number distributions and row resolved average Nusselt number levels. The heat transfer enhancement and pressure loss due to the streamwise ribs are also compared to the smooth surface impingement cooling channel. The research showed that the streamwise ribs with fillet radii produced lower Nusselt number levels than both sharp-edged ribs and impingement onto a smooth surface. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} the flame shape and the heat transfer and wall pressure characteristics of a pair of laminar premixed butane/air flame jets impinging vertically upon a horizontal water-cooled flat plate at jet Reynolds numbers of 800, 1000 and 1200, respectively. Equivalence ratio of the butane/air mixture was maintained constantly at unity. The flame shape, the pressure distribution on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> and the heat transfer from the flame to the plate were greatly influenced by the interference occurred between the two flame jets. This interference caused a sharp pressure peak at the between-jet midpoint and the positive pressures at the between-jet area, which led to the separation of the wall jet from the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> after collision. Such interference became more significant when the non-dimensional jet-to-jet spacing (S/d) and the nozzle-to-plate distance (H/d) were reduced. Heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets was at the lowest rate due to this interference at the smallest S/d ratio of 2. 6, resulting from the separation of the high-temperature inner reaction zone of the flame from the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> On the other hand, the interference enhanced the heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets when the S/d ratio was greater than 5, by enhancing the heat transfer coefficient. The average heat flux of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> was found to increase significantly with the increasing H/d ratio until H/d= 6. The present study provided detailed information on flame shape and the heat transfer and wall pressure characteristics of a twin laminar pre-mixed impinging circular flame jets, which has rarely been reported in previous studies.

40|$|The initial aim of {{this study}} was to compare OpenFoam and Ansys Fluent in order to verify OpenFoam’s Lagrangian Library and erosion capabilities. However, it was found that {{previous}} versions of Fluent have been providing wrong results for the discrete phase and the differences with the latest version (Ansys Fluent 15) are shown. A Submerged Jet Impingement Test is an effective method for studying erosion created by solid particles entrained in a liquid. When considering low particle concentrations a Lagrangian modeling of the particulate phase is a reasonable approach. Proper linkage between OpenFOAM’s Lagrangian library and the solver pimpleFoam for incompressible transient flows allows two-phase simulations to be undertaken for comparison with Ansys Fluent with the aim of verifying OpenFoam’s accuracy. Steady state convergence for the fluid flow is first accomplished and the results are compared, confirming a good agreement between the two packages. A transient simulation was then set up and spherical particles incorporated into the fluid flow. An assessment of the two codes’ discrete phase models was carried out, focusing on the differences between impact angles and velocities yielded at the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate’s</b> surface employing a similar strategy to that outlined first by Hattori et al. (2008) and later by Gnanavelu et al. (2009, 2011). In the comparison of OpenFoam with the latest version of Fluent, the main differences between the injection models are highlighted and the coupling possibilities between phases are taken into consideration. Agreement between trends for both impact angles and velocities is satisfactory when the last version of the commercial package is considered and the average discrepancy between numerical values is very low, verifying OpenFoam’s Lagrangian library.

Unsteady flows around the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> placed downstream of the delta wing and in the flow eld downstream of the onset of vortex breakdown are characterized by the existence of unsteady large-and small-scale vortices.

The integrated effects of Reynolds number and equivalence ratio of the air/fuel jet, and distance between the nozzle and the plate (i. e. nozzle-to-plate distance) on heat transfer characteristics of the flame jet system had been investigated. The influence in using <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> with different thermal conductivities, surface emissivities and roughnesses on heat flux received by the plate was examined via comparison, which had not been reported in previous literatures. A higher resistance to heat transfer had been encountered when the stainless steel <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> of lower thermal conductivity was used, which led to a significantly lower heat flux at the stagnation region.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of pulsating frequencies exiting from a hot circular air jet on the local heat transfer of a flat <b>impingement</b> aluminium <b>plate.</b> The velocity profile of a steady heated circular air jet and pulsating air jet at frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz was measured {{in the first part of}} the study. The same set-up was used to measure the heat flux of the pulsating jet impinging on a flat aluminium plate. The heat flux of the heated air jet impinging on the plate was measured using a heat flux micro-sensor at radial positions between 0 to 12 cm away from the stagnation point. Measurement of the heat flux was used to calculate the local heat transfer coefficient and local Nusselt Number for steady air jet and for air jet pulsating frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz. The Reynolds number used were 16 000, 23 300 and 32 000. Results obtained show that the local Nusselt number calculated at all measurement point for pulsating jet were higher than the local Nusselt number for steady jet. The results for pulsating jet Nusselt number was higher than the steady jet Nusselt number for the value of frequencies measured are due to the higher localised heat transfer. The higher Nusselt number obtained at localized radial positions can be due to the higher instantaneous velocity as was shown from the velocity profile plotted in the first part of the experiment. The relationship between the two results shows that higher flow velocity and turbulence intensity gives higher localized heat transfer...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions of a premixed LPG/air circular flame jet impinging upwards normally to a flat rectangular plate. Temperatures of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> were controlled by cooling water at 38 °C, 58 °C and 78 °C which was circulating at its back {{in order to create}} different plate temperatures. Under each plate temperature, the effects of Reynolds number (Re), equivalence ratio (Ф) and nozzle-to-plate distance (H) on the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions were examined. The Re was selected to be 500, 1000 and 1500 to ensure laminar flame jets. The values of Фwere chosen to cover fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions. The H varied from 3 dto 7 d with an interval of 1 d. The flame-side temperature of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> is enhanced when the cooling water temperature increases, but the temperature difference across the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> is reduced. Heat transfer from the flame to the plate is suppressed at higher cooling water temperature.

40|$|Axis {{switching}} in non-circular tube burner flame jets is studied.

A three dimensional CFD simulation {{is carried out}} to explain the phenomenon of axis switching in premixed flame jets. From the CFD simulations {{it is observed that}} the vortices formed near the corner of the tube exit are responsible for the axis switching phenomenon. These vortices control the spreading (in a preferential manner) of the flame jet along the tube axis. This preferential spreading of the flame jet is responsible for switching of contours of heat flux on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> Furthermore, for the rectangular burner, elliptical lobes of heat flux distribution on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> are observed and this is again attributed to vortex structures.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFractures of the {{proximal}} ulna are rare and usually managed surgically. Strong fixation of the harware {{is essential to}} obtain good outcomes. We report our experience with pre-contoured locking plate fixation of complex olecranon fractures and present a critical appraisal of the outcomes. HypothesisPre-contoured locking plates provide good outcomes, but their clinical tolerance may be limited in some instances. Materials and methodsFrom September 2009 to December 2011, 28 patients were managed using a pre-contoured locking compression plate (LCP®). Among them, 6 were excluded because of missing data, which left 22 patients (11 males and 11 females) {{with a mean age of}} 55. 7 years, including 12 who were employed. The fracture was on the dominant side in 11 patients. According to the Mayo Clinic classification, 15 fractures were type II and 7 type III. In addition to the ulnar fracture, a radial head fracture was present in 9 patients and a coronoid process fracture in 5 patients. Functional recovery was assessed using the Broberg-Morrey score and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Radiographs were obtained to evaluate the quality of fracture reduction and fracture healing, as well as to look for ossifications and osteoarthritis. ResultsMean follow-up was 20 months. Flexion was 131 °, extension loss was 9. 5 °, pronation was 79 °, and supination was 80. 5 °. The mean Broberg-Morrey score was 96. 7 and the mean MEPS score 96. 6. Fracture healing occurred in all patients, within a mean of 10. 6 weeks. Evidence of early osteoarthritis was found in 6 patients, ossifications in 3 patients, and synostosis in 1 patient. An infection was successfully treated with lavage and antibiotic therapy in 1 patient. The fixation hardware was removed in 6 patients. No prognostic factors were identified. Discussion-conclusionOur hypothesis was confirmed. The outcomes are encouraging and comparable to those reported in the literature.

40|$|At {{the outlet}} of the HVCA systems, {{whistling}} can occur, due to self-sustained oscillations. In this study, the ventilation outlet is modelled by a free plane subsonic jet impinging on a slotted plate, leading to self-sustained tones production; this configuration {{is known as}} the jet-slot oscillator. The tone's frequency can be predicted through the vortex dynamics within the flow. For jet velocities higher than 16 m/s, the tones couple with the flow-supply-duct’s resonances. These resonances control the vortex dynamics and reinforce the sound production, of about 20 dB. Moreover, when the distance from the jet exit to the plate is increased and reaches 4. 5 times the jet height, the fundamental frequency of the tones is suddenly halved due to some vortex pairing occurring {{at the end of the}} potential core of the jet. In this paper, the vortex pairing is observed with three different experimental techniques. Firstly, comparison between the radiated and the in-duct acoustic fields is conducted. Then the energy transfer from the fundamental to the sub-harmonics of the shear layer's velocity fluctuations is observed with anemometric measurements. Finally high speed flow visualizations are performed and allow to link the vortex <b>impingement</b> on the <b>plate</b> to the sound production...|$|R
40|$|The {{control and}} {{monitoring}} of aircraft engine subsystems {{is one of}} the leading fields of research for improving overall performance. As engine sophistication increases, more sensor information becomes available to the digital control system, as well as options for active flow control technologies. It is important to develop control systems that can take full advantage of these developments. For instance, active control of the turbine casing can reduce excess rotor blade tip clearance; for every 0. 0254 mm of clearance eliminated, specific fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 0. 1 and turbine entry temperature by up to 1 K. However, the tip clearance changes between 0. 1 mm and 0. 4 mm throughout a flight due to differences in the expansion of the rotor disc and seal casing. Active tip clearance control can be used to mitigate this variation and thereby minimise fuel burn. Equally, turbine discs and blades experience large temperature ranges that affect their lives. These can be also be improved by active cooling flow modulation. Clearly, both tip clearance problems and cooling flow modulation require sophisticated real-time models and actuation systems. This thesis has two key objectives; the validation of an active impingement system, and the development of reduced order models for discs and casings. The thesis describes the design and development of a novel facility capable of reproducing typical conditions in a large civil engine's oversegment cavity. The facility recreates the air system at cruise-level temperatures (770 K), pressures (1. 35 MPa) and mass flows (1. 0 kg/s), with a test casing that is instrumented to capture the complete three-dimensional thermal response. The facility has been designed specifically to validate a novel active clearance control concept - step climb alleviation (SCA). The SCA concept uses hot impingement jets from the oversegment cavity to heat the casing, providing a rapid thermal actuation system for tip clearance control during fast engine transients. Research at the facility allows better understanding of the circumferential heat transfer coefficients and the sealing effectiveness of the SCA <b>impingement</b> <b>plates.</b> The development of the facility considers different air system architectural solutions. A novel concentric double-vessel has been designed to accommodate the high temperatures and pressures using predominantly low cost steels. The electric heater and flow bypass system can deliver rapid changes to the test air flow rate without compromising the temperature. The rail system allows rapid change out of test geometries and accommodates the thermal growth of the facility. The commissioning results of the rig show that it can recreate engine realistic conditions. The facility has also been used to provide data for the development of reduced order models. In the second half of the thesis, a model of the test casing is developed using the newly defined LPV-SVD methodology. This method uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify modes of spatial coherence, and linear parameter varying (LPV) systems to model the non-linear dynamics. This is a low order thermal model capable of being run in real-time that requires only a small number of inputs already available in the engine measurement suite. When this is applied to the casing, an accuracy of +/- 30 K is achieved. The LPV-SVD model is capable of being applied directly to other engine components, using either experimental or simulated data for system identification. As such, it has also been applied to modelling the axisymmetric temperature of an IP disc using simulated data from SC 03. In this context, the model is built and validated using flight relevant trajectories. The disc model uses only spool speed, pressure altitude, and compressor exit temperature as inputs, and produces temperature distributions to an accuracy of +/- 32 K, with all but a few points performing much better. The thesis also presents a Kalman filter augmentation to the LPV-SVD model, which helps track noisy trajectories outside the training data set. The filtered model has been validated against a previously unseen noisy flight profile, and achieves an accuracy of +/- 30 K. Finally, a second model of disc temperature has been developed using a physics based approach, a so called grey-box model. Heat transfer from air to disc is modelled using empirical rotor-stator aerodynamics matched to validated computational fluid dynamic analyses. Lumped capacitance models and simplified explicit conduction models simulate the heat diffusion through the axial and radial profile. This physics based model is also capable of being run in real-time, but proves to be less accurate than the LPV-SVD model in like-for-like comparisons. Overall, the LPV-SVD model recreates temperatures with far greater spatial resolution, making it a superior choice for disc life monitoring applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{a study of}} the development of an area-averaged heat flux model for the thermal design of impingement premixed gas-fired round flame jets in terms of the flame and surface conditions. The influencing parameters concerning flame condition include Reynolds number and equivalence ratio of the air-fuel jet, and nozzle-to-surface distance. In terms of the impinging plate surface condition, the two influencing parameters are thermal conductivity and surface emissivity of the plate material, which affect directly the thermal conduction and radiation, respectively. Experimental studies were performed to measure the heat flux and temperature distributions of the impingement plates fabricated with materials of different thermal conductivities and surface emissivities. The premixed air-butane flame was impinging vertically upwards upon the plate's flat bottom surface essentially at laminar flow conditions. In order to examine the influence of thermal conductivity on thermal conduction, there were three materials: brass (k = 61 W/mK), bronze (k = 26 W/mK) and stainless steel (k = 14. 9 W/mK), used to fabricate the plate in the present study. Similarly, influence of surface emissivity on thermal radiation was examined by fabricating the brass <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> with surface emissivities of 0. 1, 0. 38 and 0. 98, respectively. Based on the response surface methodology, one model was developed by taking into consideration the Reynolds number, equivalence ratio, nozzle-to-surface distance and material's thermal conductivity. Another model considering the Reynolds number, equivalence ratio, nozzle-to-surface distance and material's surface emissivity was also developed. The predicted area-averaged heat flux of an <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> has been found to agree closely with that of the experimentally measured data at a 95 % confidence level. It is found that the influence on thermal characteristics of an <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> will be more significant due to its thermal conductivity rather than surface emissivity.

40|$|Background:  The limited soft tissue, {{subcutaneous}} {{location and}} poor vascularity render the dista tibial fractures very challenging. Treatment of distal tibial fractures using minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis technique may {{minimise damage to}} soft tissues and vascular integrity of bony fragments, leaving comminuted fragments out of the mechanical construct, preserving soft tissues with limited operative exposure. Objective:  To assess the outcome of patients treated with minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis technique for closed distal tibial fractures. Methods:  The study included total of 30 patients (24 males and 6 females) with close distal tibia fracture, which were treated with distal tibia locking plate using minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis technique. Results:  The mean ages of the patient were 44. 23 years (30 to 58 years). Patients were followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 1 year after the operation and evaluated clinically and radiologically. Among 30 pateints, all fractures went to union. The mean American orthopaedic foot and ankle score was 89. 23 % (SD- 3. 92). There was 2 case of superficial infection and 3 case of <b>plate</b> <b>impingement</b> with no intraoperative complication and mortality rates. Conclusion:  Minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis is an effective technique {{for the management of}} distal tibial fractures. It is minimally invasive, though technically demanding, but preserves the biological environment by preserving the soft tissue with better outcome in terms of radiological union and functional outcome.

The operation {{was done in}} supine position with small sand bag under shoulder, under general anaesthesia. Fracture was exposed through delto-pectoral approach. Fracture fragments were reduced without stripping periosteum to maximum possible achievable anatomical position and reduction was held with Kirschner wires. Reduction was checked under image intensifier. Definitive fixation with locking proximal humeral plate was done with plate positioned lateral to bicipital groove sparing tendon of long head of biceps. The plate was placed at least 1  cm distal to {{the upper end of}} greater tubercle. Plate was fixed with screw at longitudinal dynamic hole. After achieving near anatomical reduction, multidirectional screws were used to fix proximal fragments. Meticulous repairs of the rotator cuff, capsule and subscapularis muscle tears/avulsions were carried out, if found pre-operatively. Lesser tuberosity was fixed with a separate screw/wire if found avulsed. Range of motion of shoulder was checked on the table for impingement. Wound was closed under negative suction, which was removed after 48 hours. The patient were followed up at 15  days, then monthly for 6  months, and then at 12  months for final evaluation. Standard anteroposterior and axillary radiographs were obtained and evaluated for bony healing, non-union, malunion, loosening of implant, loss of reduction and avascular necrosis of head of humerus. Comparing the immediate postoperative radiographs and those taken {{at the time of the}} final assessment assessed loss of reduction. Assessment and analysis of any complications including axillary nerve injury and <b>impingement</b> due to <b>plate</b> was done. Functional outcome was assessed according to Constant–Murley score [13]. The Constant–Murley score was graded as poor (0 – 55 points), moderate (56 – 70), good (71 – 85), or excellent (86 – 100).|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment of {{proximal}} humerus fractures {{is controversial}} and various operative modalities {{have been tried}} in the literature. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate functional outcome and complication rate after open reduction and internal fixation of displaced proximal humerus fractures by proximal humerus locking plate. Materials and Methods: 52 patients with displaced proximal humerus fractures treated with proximal humerus locking plate between May 2008 and October 2010 were included in the study. Fractures were classified according to Neer′s classification into displaced 2 -part, 3 -part, and 4 -part fractures. Patients were followed for a minimum period of 1 year. 11 patients had less than 1 year of followup and were not considered in the evaluation of final results. Forty one patients were considered for final evaluation. Functional evaluation was done according to the Constant-Murley scoring system. Constant score was compared between 2 -part, 3 -part, and 4 -part fractures at final up and also between young (≤ 60 yrs) and old (> 60 yrs). Results: 11 patients had 2 -part fractures, 22 patients had 3 -part fractures, and 19 patients had 4 -part fractures. The mean followup period was 15. 21 ± 2. 59 months. 65. 8 % (n = 27) patients had good to excellent result, 19. 5 % (n = 8) had fair, and 14. 7 % (n = 6) had poor result. Constant scores for 2 -part (79. 83 ± 6. 95) and 3 -part fractures (74. 22 ± 12. 53) were significantly superior to those of 4 -part fractures (61. 09 ± 14. 29) (P value = 0. 002 and 0. 018, respectively). Difference between 2 -part and 3 -part fractures was not significant (P value = 0. 623). There was no significant difference between younger (≤ 60) and older patients (> 60). Complications encountered in this series were varus malreduction in 17 % (n = 7), screw perforation in 10 % (n = 4), <b>plate</b> <b>impingement</b> in 12 % (n = 5), infection in 2 % (n = 1), and nonunion in 2 % (n = 1) of cases. Conclusion: Proximal humerus locking plate gives reliable fixation for 2 -part and 3 -part fractures. Its use in more complicated fracture patterns of 4 -part fractures is associated with poor clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{impinging}} flame jets {{are widely}} used in industrial heating (Ex. ladle preheating) and melting applications (Ex. glass forming). In the present method, high resolution heat flux distribution is obtained by applying the inverse heat conduction technique using thermal infrared camera. The high resolution thermal imaging enables to capture the steep gradients of spatial heat flux distribution. Nusselt number and effectiveness distributions are obtained by analytical-numerical method of estimation of the adiabatic wall temperature. Three circular tube burners arranged in a staggered pattern with inter tube spacing (S/d) of 2 to 6 is considered. The ratio of distance from tube burner tip to the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> (z/d) is varied from 2 to 6 while the Reynolds number is varied from 400 to 1000. For the smallest S/d = 2, the interaction amongst the flames is significant and leads to non-circular hot spot distribution for heat flux. The average Nusselt number and average effectiveness are higher for higher Re for all z/d unless the inner premixed cone touches the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> The average Nusselt number and average effectiveness are marginally higher for smaller S/d for the same z/d and Re. The coefficient of variance increases {{with the increase in}} S/d. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the main axial flow of butane/air mixture, two tangential air flows {{had been used to}} produce a premixed gas-fired impinging circular flame jet with induced swirl. The flame jet system under investigation was small-scale and operated essentially at the low-pressure and laminar flow conditions. The swirl number was estimated, with the aid of the Continuity Equation, to be 0. 78. The whole investigation was conducted at R e = 1000 and Φ = 7. The non-dimensional nozzle-to-plate distance (H/d) was varied from 10 to 3. 0. The radial heat flux distributions on the horizontally placed <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> had been measured under various experimental conditions, which were compared with those obtained from a previous study [1] with similar impinging flame jet system without induced swirl. The total heat fluxes obtained on the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> at different H/d ratio had also been measured to identify its effect on the thermal performance of the system. It was shown from the present study that the introduction of swirl to the small-scale, low-pressure and low Reynolds number premixed gas-fired impinging flame jet was feasible. Certainly, more investigations would be required to fully understand its heat transfer characteristics.

40|$|In modern gas {{turbines}} parts of combustion chamber and turbine section are under heavy heat load, for example, the rotor inlet temperature is {{far higher than}} the melting point of the rotor blade material. These high temperatures causes thermal stresses in the material, therefore {{it is very important}} to cool the components for safe operation and to achieve desired component life. But on the other hand the cooling reduces the turbine efficiency, for that reason it is vital to understand and optimize the cooling technique. In this project Thermochromic Liquid Crystals (TLCs) are used to measure distribution of heat transfer coefficient over a scaled up combustor liner section. TLCs change their color with the variation of temperature in a particular temperature range. The color-temperature change relation of a TLC is sharp and precise; therefore TLCs are used to measure surface temperature by painting the TLC over a test surface. This method is called Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT). LCT is getting popular in industry due to its high-resolution results, repeatability and ease of use. Test model in present study consists of two plates, target plate and <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> Cooling of the target plate is achieved by impingement of air coming through holes in the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> The downstream surface of the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> is then cooled by cross flow and re-impingement of the coolant air. Heat transfer on the target plate is not uniform; areas under the jet which are called stagnation points have high heat transfer as compare to the areas away from the center of jet. It is almost the same situation for the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> but the location of stagnation point is different. A transient technique is used to measure this non-uniform heat transfer distribution. It is assumed that the plates are semi-infinitely thick and there is no lateral heat transfer in the plates. To fulfill the assumptions a calculated time limit is followed and the test plates are made of Plexiglas which has very low thermal conductivity. The transient technique requires a step-change in the mainstream temperature of the test section. However, in practical a delayed increase in mainstream temperature is attained. This issue is dealt by applying Duhamel’s theorem on the step-change heat transfer equation. MATLAB is used to get the Hue data of the recorded video frames and calculate the time taken for each pixel to reach a predefined surface temperature. Having all temperatures and time values the heat transfer equation is iteratively solved to get the value of heat transfer coefficient of each and every pixel of the test surface. In total fifteen tests are conducted with different Reynolds number and different jet-to-target plate distances. It is concluded that for both the target and impingement plates, a high Reynolds number provides better overall heat transfer and increase in jet-to-target distance decreases the overall heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|Evaporating liquid cascades {{resulting}} from gasoline and {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) tanks overfilling or rupture of elevated pipes create a source of flammable vapour cloud. Such phenomena {{were responsible for the}} formation of the large fuel vapour cloud, the ignition of which resulted in the large scale explosion, in Buncefield [1] on 11 December 2005 at the Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal, an oil storage facility located by Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, England. Despite its significance, there lacks adequate models treating the underlying physics of this phenomenon. The present study numerically analyses fuel cascades which are considered as a droplet-laden system. Consideration is given to vapour production inside the cascade due to droplets evaporation and breakup. The solver used here is a modification of the sprayFoam solver which is present in the open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM® [2]. The fuel droplets evaporate during their motion and create a cloud of flammable vapour. In order to capture the characteristics of the hazardous phenomena, the CFD model needs to address the underlying physics with adequate sub-models. In the present study, the multi-phase flow is simulated with a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The governing equations of the gas phase represent the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy including the source terms arising from the interaction with the droplets. The Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation approach was used for its computational efficiency. The Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) would be more robust in handling the interaction of the droplets with the flow but it would be require more computational resource. The particulate phase is simulated through a Lagrangian deterministic or stochastic tracking models to provide particle trajectories and particle concentration. Particular emphasis is given to the effect of impingement of droplets to account for the effect of splashing in the impact region. The study involves developing robust and accurate modelling approaches for the instabilities and aerodynamic breakup in the cascade which contribute to the formation of the cloud, air entrainment and fuel <b>impingement</b> on deflector <b>plates.</b> Suitable sub-models have been implemented in OpenFOAM® to facilitate the study. The predictions are compared with the experimental measurements and CFD predictions previously conducted by Atkinson and Coldrick [3] from the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL), an agency of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The present predictions are found to better capture the interaction between the droplets and the gas phase. Improved agreement with the experimental measurements in the gasoline fuel cascades has also been achieved...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} the fish and fishery of Stocks Reservoir, Lancashire, {{is the result of}} {{contract}} work undertaken by the researcher for North West Water (NWW). In an attempt to describe the location of the study, relevant information covering the catchment, local geology, reservoir construction and flora and fauna is included. The Authority's remit suggested a study of three facets of the catchment, namely, a {{study of the}} native fish populations, a monitoring of the recently opened fishery and an analysis of operational filter <b>plate</b> <b>impingement.</b> In order to minimise disturbance of the sport fishery, native fish population work was necessarily limited to the reservoir's three major afferent streams, the River Hodder, Hasgill Beck and Bottoms Beck. As a preliminary measure of tributary stream status, a simple invertebrate site study was undertaken by the researcher in 1985. Fish population work based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) was pursued in the spring, summer and winter of 1985, 1986 and 1987 at 8 sites, employing D. C. electric fishing equipment, whilst Carle and Strub's (1978) MWL Method was adopted for population estimations. The validity of the electric fishing survey and age determination are discussed in the text. The native species of brown trout, bullhead, stone loach and minnow were encountered, as was the introduced rainbow trout. Species densities and the population structure of the native brown trout were examined in detail for each survey site. The River Hodder was revealed to be the least populous tributary, whilst Hasgill Beck exhibited the greatest fish densities. Spawning migrations of native brown trout were evident, with fry recruitment at its optimum at site 4 on Hasgill Beck and site 8 on Bottoms Beck. The waterfall on Bottoms Beck might well have precluded upstream access to the head waters of this tributary. Observed mean brown trout length for age data were similar to those recorded by authors researching other upland stream locations. The history of Stocks Reservoir as a sport fishery is outlined prior to the present leaseholder's opening of the reservoir as a day ticket fly fishery for the 1985 season. The water was stocked predominantly with rainbow trout, together with some brook trout and brown trout before fishing commenced. The present study covering the seasons 1985 to 1987 was based primarily on data abstracted from catch return forms, which displayed a notably high rate of submission, and stocking consent data provided by NWW. The validity of return form data is discussed. Over the three seasons studied, angler patronage was observed to decline by 16 %, whilst the number of fish caught and taken also declined by 34. 8 % and 20. 5 % respectively. Angler success was similarly observed to decline in accord with the decrease in patronage and catches. Interestingly, there was an increased reliance on introductions of rainbow trout over the period, including larger fish, and by 1987 a cessation in the stocking of other trout species. From correlations observed between environmental parameters and angler patronage, anglers appeared to prefer fishing in dry, sunny conditions, but decreases in angler success occurred during periods of increased water turbidity. Such declines in success also displayed congruity with decreases in angler patronage. From a comparison undertaken with a cross-section of English and Welsh stillwater trout fisheries, Stocks Reservoir was judged to rate poorly, returning the lowest performance data in the upland stocked category. An examination of the stomach and hind gut contents of 127 rainbow trout, 7 brook trout and 8 brown trout caught by anglers, was undertaken in the 1985 and 1986 seasons, and was compared with the reservoir fauna data of Mills, M. L. (1971). A description of the water treatment plant and its operation is delineated, and a pertinent collection of fish impingement and screening literature is included. Impingement data were collated from lst March 1985 to 31 st December 1987 from routine and emergency cleaning of the filter plates. After storage in a freezer, the thawed fish were examined chronologically, identified, measured and weighed. During the examinations a random sample of stomach and hind guts was procured, and scales from brown trout were removed for possible future reference. The total annual impingement was observed to vary considerably, although brown trout habitually exhibited the greatest losses, comprising 71 %, 64 % and 89 % of fish impinged annually. Of the introduced species, rainbow trout and brook trout, brook trout were the more susceptible to impingement, but remarkably few rainbow trout were lost considering the number stocked. Rainbow trout and brook trout of medium (150 mm to 300 mm) and large (> 300 mm) length classes were impinged, whereas many smaller (< 150 mm) brown trout were lost, a phenomenon concurrent with the recruitment of juvenile stream fish to the reservoir population. Brown trout in particular exhibited an annual dissimilarity in rates of impingement, probably suggesting that seasonal migration was not causative of their increased impingement. Impingement of rainbow trout showed limited correlation with environmental parameters. In 1985 and 1986, increased impingement of both brown trout and brook trout was significantly correlated with low reservoir levels, and to some extent might be linked to rising values of water turbidity. The collecting of stomach and hind gut samples from impinged fish was discontinued after 1985 because of problems in collection associated with delays in sampling and probable regurgitation of stomach contents. The problem of eye fluke infestation in impinged fish was noted and enumerated as sampling progressed. A brief discussion of further routes of operational fish loss from the reservoir is included...|$|R
40|$|Energy from spent flame {{or other}} low grade energy {{can be used}} to {{increase}} the temperature of the air before mixing with fuel. This would improve the heat transfer characteristics of the impinging flame jet. The studies on impinging flame jets reported in the literature are based on the fuel-air mixture at ambient temperature. In the present work, the inlet air for mixture is heated by an electrical heater. The heat flux distribution is estimated using an inverse heat conduction (IHCP) technique. The Nusselt number (Nu) and effectiveness (eta) distributions are obtained by estimating the adiabatic wall temperature (T-aw) by the analytical-numerical method. A circular burner of 13. 5 mm is used for impingement on quartz plate of 3 mm thickness. Reynolds number (Re) varying from 500 to 2000 for the non-dimensional burner tip to <b>impingement</b> <b>plate</b> spacing (Z/d) of 2 - 6 and stoichiometric condition (phi = 1. 0) is considered for varying preheated condition. The effect of equivalence ratio is studied for phi = 0. 75 to 1. 5 for Re = 1000 and Z/d = 4. By increase in preheat temperature, the stagnation point heat flux increases from 20 % to 50 % unless the inner premixed zone touches the <b>impingement</b> <b>plate.</b> CFD simulations are carried out in FLUENT software to explain the distribution of heat flux.
