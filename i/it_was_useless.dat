5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E
5|$|Believing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to {{continue}} arguing with Cao, Vann climbed {{back into his}} L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and left Tan Hiep. Throughout the afternoon, he continued to press Cao to quickly deploy the South Vietnamese paratroopers. He was fearful that the battle {{would turn out to}} be the largest defeat of South Vietnamese forces up to that point of the war. Cao promised to deploy the second Civil Guard battalion which had just arrived at the southwest flank of Ap Bac, and to drop the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion at around 16:00 behind Ba's armored personnel carriers. Late in the afternoon, a flight of C-123 Providers, with about 300 South Vietnamese paratroopers aboard, closed in on their objective and quickly drew machine gun fire from the hamlet. The C-123 pilots changed course to avoid the ground fire, but either the South Vietnamese jump master or the American flight leader did not compensate for the change. As a result, the paratroopers landed right in front of the entrenched Viet Cong positions, instead of behind the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron and the Civil Guards.|$|E
25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, {{because some of}} the batsmen showed beyond all doubt that anyone who could really hit the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose slowly from the turf.|$|E

25|$|Only seven {{machines}} {{had been}} constructed at Laupheim before an air raid halted production in July 1944, and {{wiped out the}} factory. At {{the time of the}} raid, the V18 prototype was ready for delivery, 13 Drachen were in assembly, and there were enough components for a further 19. Following the raid the Air Ministry decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to pursue the project any further and following the mountain trials Focke was assigned to Messerschmitt's staff.|$|E
25|$|We {{had found}} out that the Bf109 and the FW190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless.</b> We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photo-reconnaissance and had to be {{withdrawn}} from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.|$|E
25|$|If Campese wanted to, I am sure {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E

25|$|On 27 July 1809, as Victor pursued Gregorio García de la Cuesta's Spanish army, Arthur Wellesley's British troops {{attempted}} {{to cover their}} retreat across the Alberche River. Having successfully overseen {{the withdrawal of the}} Spanish infantry, Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's British 3rd Division pulled back to the west bank. The British cavalry had been withdrawn because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> in the wooded area near the Casa de Salinas in which Mackenzie's troops were situated. Lapisse's division crossed the Alberche farther north undetected and was able to get close to the British formation because its pickets were badly posted. Wellesley was there in person and even he was completely taken by surprise as Lapisse's division rolled forward against Mackenzie's left flank. With the 16th Light Infantry in the front line with the other three regiments in support, the French fell on Rufane Shaw Donkin's brigade, breaking the 2nd Battalion of the 87th Foot, 1st Battalion of the 88th Foot and 2nd Battalion of the 31st Foot and taking 80 prisoners. The 1st Battalion of the 45th Foot and a half-battalion of the 60th Foot held firm and covered the retreat of the beaten units. Though Lapisse aggressively pressed forward, Mackenzie's division was able to fall back to the main position in good order well-protected by the 14th Light Dragoons and the 1st Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion (KGL). However, the Casa de Salinas action cost the British 447 casualties, including 70 killed, 284 wounded, and 93 missing. The 87th alone lost 198 casualties. Lapisse's losses were probably less than 100.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Three Represents", {{literally}} a Marxism adapted to Chinese conditions, {{was adopted by}} the party at the 16th National Congress. Certain segments within the CCP criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values, supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Jiang disagreed, and had concluded that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to try to force a change in the mode of production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the economic laws of history. The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists, officially referred to as the [...] "new social strata", to join the party {{on the grounds that they}} engaged in [...] "honest labor and work" [...] and through their labour contributed [...] "to build socialism with Chinese characteristics." [...] The 3rd Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee conceived and formulated the ideology of the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is considered to be Hu Jintao's contribution to the official ideological discourse. To apply the Scientific Outlook on Development to Chinese conditions, the CCP must adhere to building a Harmonious Socialist Society.|$|E
500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E

When this perspective was not endorsed by the leadership Zam and his co-thinkers went into the left wing of the Socialist Party of America.|$|E
2500|$|To {{open the}} season, Tech {{defeated}} VMI 7–0. The Cadets played strongly for two quarters, but were near collapse by game's end. Al Barnes starred for VMI and Stumpy Thomason starred for Tech. [...] "The V. M. I. team tried every brand of football they knew. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> against the Tech defense and offense." [...] The lone score came from Warner Mizell.|$|E

2500|$|A second Decauville {{line was}} {{constructed}} in Jerusalem, winding around the mountains close to the Old City, continuing to al-Bireh in the north. This railway was initiated by General Allenby after a Turkish counter-attack on the British in Jerusalem, who had recently occupied the city. Construction began in May 1918 and completed in September of the same year, by which time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> because the front had moved northwards. This short line passed in today's Knesset and Biblical Zoo area. A further narrow gauge extension, at [...] gauge was built by the British from Lydda to Tira and Lubban, partly adjacent to the existing [...] Turkish line.|$|E

2500|$|The other regiments {{were more}} {{significantly}} dispersed. The 508th experienced the worst drop {{of any of}} the PIRs, with only 25 per cent jumping within a mile of the DZ. Half the regiment dropped east of the Merderet, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> to its original mission. The 507th PIR's pathfinders landed on DZ T, but because of Germans nearby, marker lights could not be turned on. Approximately half landed nearby in grassy swampland along the river. Estimates of drowning casualties vary from [...] "a few" [...] to [...] "scores" [...] (against an overall D-Day loss in the division of 156 killed in action), but much equipment was lost and the troops had difficulty assembling.|$|E
2500|$|After {{several years}} away from a regular TV job, Louis-Dreyfus began a new single-camera sitcom, Watching Ellie, which premiered on NBC in February 2002. The series was created by husband Brad Hall, and co-starred Steve Carell and Louis-Dreyfus' {{half-sister}} Lauren Bowles. The initial premise of the show was to present viewers with a [...] "slice of life" [...] from the goings-on and happenings {{of the life of}} Ellie Riggs, a Southern California jazz singer. The first season included a 22-minute countdown kept digitally in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, which many critics panned, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless</b> and [...] "did nothing for the show." [...] Overall, the show received mixed reviews, but debuted strongly with over 16 million viewers tuning in for the series premiere, and maintained an average audience of about 10 million viewers per week.|$|E
2500|$|This {{scheme was}} leaked, then ruined by a decree of the Assembly of 7 November 1789, such that no {{member of the}} Assembly could become a minister. This decree {{destroyed}} any chance {{of the sort of}} harmony between ministers and parliament that existed in England and dashed Mirabeau's hopes. The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau's counsel saying, [...] "I hope that we shall never sink so low that we shall have to ask for aid from Mirabeau.", and La Marck left Paris. However, in April 1790, La Marck was suddenly recalled by the comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the Austrian ambassador to Paris, and became the queen's most trusted political adviser. From this time to Mirabeau's death, he was the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>useless,</b> for Lafayette was not a strong man himself.|$|E
