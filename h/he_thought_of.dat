5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> King Kong after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant gorilla fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.|$|E

5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E

5|$|Saturn's rings require {{at least}} a 15-mm-diameter {{telescope}} to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> them as two moons on Saturn's sides. It was not until Christiaan Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted. Huygens discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap {{now known as the}} Cassini Division.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield's first {{club was}} Evesham Colts under-10s. He played at county level for Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Devon. When his family settled back in Devon he joined Twyford Spartans, scoring 84 goals in 54 matches. He played in Tiverton Town's youth {{team as a}} left back before {{reverting}} to being a striker at his first senior club, non-League side Cullompton Rangers. He later moved to Elmore, where he attracted trials from Exeter City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Torquay United, {{all of which were}} unsuccessful. His siblings joined the Royal Air Force and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> joining them, but continued searching for a breakthrough in professional football.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E

6000|$|For {{the first}} time a {{conscientious}} doubt arose in Edward's mind as to the justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the alternative offered by Miss Aldclyffe.

5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was {{not satisfied}} with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|James Dudley {{began working}} for Jess McMahon in the 1950s, when McMahon was a {{co-owner}} of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When McMahon and his partners {{broke away from the}} National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963, Dudley continued to work for McMahon. Dudley performed many different jobs, from carrying buckets of waters to counting ticket sales. Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon's limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> McMahon as a father figure. McMahon later increased Dudley's responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the Town and Country Jamboree television show.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> an online email directory as an easier to way to find people. Algard bought the Whitepages.com domain for $900, which he says was all of his savings at the time. He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself as an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities {{as a result of}} slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{teaching}} about Zen {{practice and the}} history of Zen (Chan) Buddhism, Suzuki was an expert scholar on the related philosophy called, in Japanese, Kegon, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the intellectual explication of Zen experience.|$|E

60|$|He {{unhooked}} the receiver, {{and asked}} despondently {{to be connected}} with Room Service. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> bitterly <b>of</b> the exigent Jane, whom he recollected dimly as a tall female with teeth. <b>He</b> half <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{going down to the}} grill-room on the chance of finding a friend there, but the waiter {{was on his way to}} the room. He decided that he might as well stay where he was.|$|R
25|$|In a Reddit AmA thread by Dante Basco, the {{original}} voice of Prince Zuko, {{when he was}} asked what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Last Airbender film, he responded by saying that Konietzko and DiMartino told him not to see it.|$|E
25|$|Moro's main aim was {{to widen}} the {{democratic}} base of the government: the cabinets {{should have been able}} to represent a bigger number of voters and parties. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the DC as the fulcrum of a coalition system, on the principles of consociative democracy.|$|E

25|$|According to Vasari, Paolo Uccello was {{so obsessed}} with {{perspective}} that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three Battle of San Romano pictures which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.|$|E
