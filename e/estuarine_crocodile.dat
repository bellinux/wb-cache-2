The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are wild boar, chital horin (spotted deer), Indian otter and macaque monkey.

40|$|We radio-tracked five {{male and}} eight female <b>estuarine</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus porosus) in a {{non-tidal}} waterhole in Lakefield National Park in northern Queensland {{during the late}} dry/mid-wet season (2003 - 04) and the following dry season (2004). Individual crocodiles occupied larger home ranges (River Channel Areas (RCA) during the late dry/mid-wet season (10. 64 ᠲ. 86 ha) than in the dry season (3. 20 ᠱ. 02 ha), and males occupied larger home ranges (23. 89 ᠲ. 36 ha) than females (5. 94 ᠱ. 34 ha) during the late dry/mid-wet season. There were no obvious differences in home range between sexes during the dry season. During the late dry/mid-wet season, adult males often travelled long distances along the waterhole while females moved less. During the dry season, movement patterns were quite variable, with no clear difference between sexes. All crocodiles were most active from late afternoon (1500 - 1800 hours) until midnight. Individual home ranges (RCA) overlapped considerably during the late dry/mid-wet season. The extent of home-range overlap between three adult males {{and the number of}} times they either passed each other or were located near each other was particularly striking. Previous research has come to conflicting conclusions about the extent of territoriality in wild <b>estuarine</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> although it has been widely believed that males are highly territorial. The findings imply that large adult male <b>estuarine</b> <b>crocodiles</b> are not highly territorial in non-tidal freshwater systems that are geographically confined. No Full Tex...|$|R

Enrofloxacin plasma concentrations were determined by diode array detection-high-performance liquid chromatography (limit of detection/limit of quantitation: 0. 05 microg/ml). Data were subjected to noncompartmental analysis. The integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) variables showed that optimal area under the curve {{from the time of}} dosing to 24 hr:minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (> 125) and peak plasma concentrations:MIC (> 8) ratios, as reported for concentration-dependent bactericidal antimicrobials like fluoroquinolones, were achievable with both a single i. v. or i. m. dose for susceptible microorganisms with MIC values of < or = 0. 5 microg/ml, while the relatively slow onset of peak time allowed an effective plasma drug level only on day 3. The persistence of useful plasma concentrations indicated the possibility of redosing every 3 day for parenteral routes of administration, while further studies are needed for the oral route. Nevertheless, the absence of adverse reactions in the animals following i. v., i. m., or p. o. administration of enrofloxacin after a single dose of 5 mg/kg indicates the possibility of its safe and effective clinical use in captive <b>estuarine</b> <b>crocodiles...</b>|$|R
