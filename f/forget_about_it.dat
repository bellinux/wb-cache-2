Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, we have to be honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1902–03, Bosanquet took part in another tour, this time with Lord Hawke's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner. In New Zealand, he played two matches against a New Zealand {{representative}} side, and in all matches scored 148 runs {{at an average of}} 18.50 with one fifty, an innings of 82 against South Island. Bosanquet also took 18 wickets at an average of 22.61; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention. [...] In one game, Charles Bannerman, who played in Australia's first Test match in 1877, was umpire. He told Warner: [...] "When the next team goes to Australia, be sure that Mr Bosanquet is in it. He bowls a lot of bad 'uns; but that ball of his that breaks the wrong way will be very useful on the hard Australian wickets." [...] However, the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury. Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings, but bowled poorly afterwards. He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball, it {{looked as if he had}} bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket-keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: [...] "You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that." [...] Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated. However, the incident continued to attract attention. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.|$|E

2500|$|Years {{passed and}} Richter became a {{successful}} screenwriter. Mac Rauch took Richter {{up on his}} offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director Irwin Winkler who gave Mac Rauch rent money {{for the next six}} months. Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife about a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by [...] "all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early '70s". Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several Banzai stories and that he [...] "would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one". Mac Rauch recalled, [...] "It's so easy to start something and then—since you're really not as serious about it as you should be—end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in a drawer and try to <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Over the years, I started a dozen Buckaroo scripts that ended that way".|$|E

2500|$|The germ of {{the idea}} for their next film together, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) came from Buñuel and Serge Silberman {{discussing}} uncanny repetition in everyday life; Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to <b>forget</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so that, {{on the night of}} the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes. The film tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in The Exterminating Angel, where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal. For this film, Buñuel, Silberman and Carrière assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, [...] "a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema", according to one critic. For the first time, Buñuel made use of a video-playback monitor, which allowed him to make much more extensive use of crane shots and elaborate tracking shots, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for reshoots. Filming required only two months and Buñuel claimed that editing took only one day. When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which it won, leading Buñuel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of, [...] "2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – the way she was opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her.
