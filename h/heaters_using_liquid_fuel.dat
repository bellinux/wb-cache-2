50|$|Some common {{properties}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are that they}} are easy to transport, and can be handled with relative ease. Also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications, and home use.

5000|$|Early {{blowtorches}} <b>used</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> {{carried in}} a refillable reservoir attached to the lamp. Modern blowtorches are mostly gas-fuelled. Their fuel reservoir is disposable or refillable by exchange. The term [...] "blowlamp" [...] usually refers to liquid-fuelled torches still used in the UK. Liquid-fuelled torches are pressurized by a piston hand pump, while gas torches are self-pressurized by the fuel evaporation.|$|R
50|$|A furnace can be {{lit by a}} small {{pilot flame}} or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames {{nowadays}} are lit by an ignition transformer (much like a car's spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both diesel and natural gas. When <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels,</b> an atomizer is <b>used,</b> otherwise, the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (like a match).|$|R

50|$|Gasoline is {{the most}} widely <b>used</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel.</b> Gasoline, {{as it is known}} in United States and Canada, or petrol {{virtually}} everywhere else, is made of hydrocarbon molecules (compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon only) forming aliphatic compounds, or chains of carbons with hydrogen atoms attached. However, many aromatic compounds (carbon chains forming rings) such as benzene are found naturally in gasoline and cause the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to the fuel.|$|R
5000|$|Energy {{efficiency}} in transport is often, and confusingly, {{described in terms}} of fuel consumption, being fuel consumption the reciprocal of fuel economy. Nonetheless, fuel consumption is linked with a means of propulsion which <b>uses</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels,</b> whilst energy efficiency is applicable to any sort of propulsion. To avoid said confusion, {{and to be able to}} compare the energy {{efficiency in}} any type of vehicle, experts tend to measure the energy in the International System of Units, i.e., Joules.|$|R
50|$|The {{launch of}} the rocket called Pajohesh marked Iran's first <b>use</b> of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> in such an operation. The rocket reached the {{altitude}} of 72 miles before Fargam was returned to Earth safely.|$|R

25|$|By 1939, von Kármán's GALCIT had {{received}} Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets {{to assist in}} aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered. Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech, since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rockets with solid fuel, while he was <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{invention}} of the portable stove in the 19th century, a wide variety of designs and models have seen use {{in a number of different}} applications. Portable stoves can be broken down into several broad categories based on the type of fuel used and stove design: unpressurized stoves that <b>use</b> solid or <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> placed in the burner before ignition; stoves that <b>use</b> a volatile <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> in a pressurized burner; bottled gas stoves; and gravity-fed [...] "spirit" [...] stoves.|$|R
50|$|Various {{scientists}} and engineers contributed {{to the development of}} internal combustion engines. In 1791, John Barber developed a turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a Gas Engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to <b>use</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel,</b> and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens built the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz built an internal combustion engine ignited by an electric spark. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially.|$|R
40|$|Combustion instabilities remain one of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems encountered in developing propulsion and power systems. Large amplitude pressure oscillations, driven by unsteady heat release, can produce numerous detrimental effects. Most previous active control studies utilized gaseous fuels to suppress combustion instabilities. However, <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> to suppress combustion instabilities is more realistic for propulsion applications. Active instability suppression in vortex-driven combustors <b>using</b> a direct <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injection strategy was theoretically established and experimentally demonstrated in this dissertation work. Droplet size measurements revealed that with pulsed fuel injection management, fuel droplet size could be modulated periodically. Consequently, desired heat release fluctuation could be created. If this oscillatory heat release is coupled with the natural pressure oscillation in an out of phase manner, combustion instabilities can be suppressed. To identify proper locations of supplying additional <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> for the purpose of achieving control, the natural heat release pattern in a vortex-driven combustor was characterized in this study. It was found that at high Damköhler number oscillatory heat release pattern closely followed the evolving vortex front. However, when Damköhler number became close to unity, heat release fluctuation wave no longer coincided with the coherent structures. A heat release deficit area was found near the dump plane when combustor was operated in lean premixed conditions. Active combustion instability suppression experiments were performed in a dump combustor <b>using</b> a controlled <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injection strategy. High-speed Schlieren results illustrated that vortex shedding {{plays an important role in}} maintaining self-sustained combustion instabilities. Complete combustion instability control requires total suppression of these large-scale coherent structures. The sound pressure level at the excited dominant frequency was reduced by more than 20 dB with controlled <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injection method. Scaling issues were also investigated in this dump combustor to test the effectiveness of <b>using</b> pulsed <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injection strategies to suppress instabilities at higher power output conditions. With the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injection control method, it was possible to suppress strong instabilities with initial amplitude of 5 psi down to the background noise level. The stable combustor operating range was also expanded from equivalence ratio of 0. 75 to beyond 0. 9...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) have the {{advantage}} of being able to operate with fuels other than hydrogen. In particular, <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> are especially attractive for powering portable applications such as small power generators or auxiliary power units, in which case the direct utilization of the fuel would be convenient. Although <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> are easier to handle and transport than hydrogen, their direct use in SOFC can lead to anode deactivation due to carbon formation, especially on traditional nickel/yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni/YSZ) anodes. Significant advances have been made in anodic materials that are resistant to carbon formation but often these materials are less electrochemically active than Ni/YSZ. In this review the challenges of <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> directly in SOFC, in terms of gas-phase and catalytic reactions within the anode chamber, will be discussed and the alternative anode materials so far investigated will be compared...|$|R

30|$|BSCF {{membranes}} [28] {{produce the}} highest oxygen fluxes under given operating conditions. Recent research papers [29, 30, 31] {{indicate that there}} are substantial efforts to enhance the performance and the stability of BSCF based membranes, especially hollow fiber membranes [30, 31]. Though, there is little work conducted on ITMs performance under reactive conditions, {{there is absolutely no}} work carried out on ITMs utilizing <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> as oxidizers. Therefore, the present article presents the investigation of characteristics of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> in a BSCF parallel tube ITM reactor. The advantages of <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> include high specific energy, storage safety and availability. Oxy-combustion of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> has been investigated recently as a solution for carbon capture and reduction of soot and NOx emissions [32]. The use of ITMs to produce oxygen for the conversion of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> into thermal energy in an oxygen transport reactor (OTR) while capturing CO 2 is presented. In this case, the OTR will have two functions: O 2 separation and reaction of evaporated <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> with oxygen. A parametric study of the influence of parameters such as oxygen pressure in the feed and the permeate sides on the performance of the OTR is conducted.|$|R
50|$|The Ares was a {{proposed}} {{intercontinental ballistic missile}} (ICBM) derived from the Titan II missile. It was a single-stage rocket with a high-performance engine to increase the rocket's specific impulse. Both Aerojet and Rocketdyne carried out engine design studies for the project, but Ares was ultimately cancelled in favour of solid-fuel ICBMs, which were safer to store and could be launched with much less notice. The Ares missile series was canceled due to the inconvenience of <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel.</b> Some reasons included extensive protection from corrosion within the silos, {{as well as the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> propellant, ideally <b>used</b> in the proposed Ares missiles, being more expensive to maintain. Thus making the transition to use the Titan II missiles, that ran on solid fuel, easier because solid fuel was more reliable for sand was less expensive than previous projects. Hence the cancellation of the Ares missile series.|$|R
50|$|The Magnum {{was a large}} super-heavy-lift rocket {{designed}} by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center during the mid-1990s. The Magnum, which never made it past the preliminary design phase, {{would have been a}} booster some 96 meters (315 feet) tall, on the scale of the Saturn V and was originally designed to carry a human expedition to Mars. It was to have used two strap-on side boosters, similar to the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), but <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> instead. Some designs had the strap-on boosters using wings and jet engines, which would enable them to fly back to the launch area after they were jettisoned in flight. The Magnum was designed to carry around 80 tons of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO).|$|R
50|$|Previous {{long-range}} missiles <b>used</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> {{that could}} only be loaded just prior to firing. The loading process took from 30 to 60 minutes in typical designs. Although lengthy, this was not considered to be a problem at the time, because it took about {{the same amount of time}} to spin up the inertial guidance system, set the initial position, and program in the target coordinates. Minuteman was designed from the outset to be launched in minutes. While solid fuel eliminated the fueling delays, the delays in starting and aligning the guidance system remained. For quick launch, the guidance system would have to be kept running and aligned at all times, which was a serious problem for the mechanical systems, especially the gyroscopes which used ball bearings.|$|R
30|$|The present work aims at {{investigating}} {{oxy-fuel combustion}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> in a concentric parallel tube oxygen transport reactor (OTR) using BSCF ion transport membrane (ITM) for oxygen separation. A computational model {{was developed and}} validated utilizing the available experimental results. It is assumed that the same model will be sufficient to capture reasonable results with <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> oxy-combustion. The <b>use</b> of ITMs to produce oxygen for the conversion of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> into thermal energy in an oxygen transport reactor (OTR) while capturing CO 2 is presented. In this case, the OTR has two functions: O 2 separation and reaction of evaporated <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> with oxygen. A parametric study {{of the influence of}} parameters such as oxygen pressure in the feed and the permeate sides on the performance of the OTR is conducted. The effect of the rates of the feed flow and sweep flow on the permeation of oxygen permeation has been evaluated. Subsequently, the effects of flow rates of feed and sweep on temperature and reaction characteristics are also explored. The optimal flow rates and flammability limits for the present geometry model to obtain maximum output are suggested. The feasibility of <b>using</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> as potential fuel to be used in near future oxygen transport reactors is presented.|$|R
40|$|A need {{exists to}} develop and {{demonstrate}} a low pollutant emission gas turbine combustor design that <b>uses</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> for propulsion applications. The present work addresses this need by developing and demonstrating design guidelines for a <b>liquid</b> <b>fueled,</b> lean burn, gas turbine combustor injector. This injector is designed to accommodate all the combustion air, and includes a fuel and air mixing section with an internal venturi contour that contains an aerodynamic swirler, and an atomizer. The atomizer is a plain jet, airblast type with eight ports that spray radially into a high-velocity cross-stream of combustion air. Reacting test {{results show that the}} fuel and air are sufficiently well mixed to create a uniform distributed reaction which is (1) of finite length, and (2) free from pulsation or other combustion-induced instabilities. Emissions data at elevated pressure and temperature establish that this injector has low pollution emissions, and high combustion efficiency. © 1998 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N. V...|$|R

50|$|Before the One Year War, {{an average}} space fighter <b>uses</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> rocket engine for {{propulsion}} and directed solid fuel pellet for turning.

It was not only used as the main fighter of the EFSF but also as a trainer plane for Z Plus pilots.|$|R
