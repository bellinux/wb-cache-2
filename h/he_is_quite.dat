His {{appearance}} is that of a female and he acts in a feminine way due to his upbringing, wearing girl's clothing within and outside his father's temple. He is also a close friend and classmate of Shiina, who often asks him to try on her cosplay costumes, but as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> shy, he generally refuses. He harbors homosexual feelings towards Okabe, who calls him by a nickname , and thinks of Luka as his pupil. He is 16 years old. While he does become a female for part of the story and in most of the time lines throughout the story, canonically he is male by the end, and in only one of multiple time lines Luka was female.|$|E

25|$|Tatsuya is {{the main}} male protagonist in the story. He is very {{knowledgeable}} about {{the moon and the}} Kingdom of Sphere because he has been interested in it since he was very young.

Tatsuya constantly finds enjoyment in teasing Natsuki about random things. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> loyal toward Feena and her aim to fulfill her mother's dream to reunite the Earth and Moon.

25|$|Rett is Deshwitat's {{best friend}} and {{fighting}} partner, both {{in the past and}} in the present. Rett led a party of men to attempt to stop Kalutika's rebirth into a God, but arrived too late. Because of their past friendship, Kalutika forced immortality on him so that Rett would have to witness the end of the world. Rett is a good natured and rowdy man who enjoys beer, women, and good living. He is often able to read Deshwitat's true feelings, no matter how much the vampire tries to conceal them. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> lecherous, particularly to Millenear, Remy and Beryun.

25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Wilcher left The Wiggles. Their spokesperson, Dianna O'Neill, {{claims that}} he {{submitted}} a letter of resignation {{because he wanted to}} continue composing classical music. According to fellow founding member Greg Page, [...] "Archie had considerable input into the arrangement of some songs on that first CD ... <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> a musical genius ... However ... the musical direction of The Wiggles was changing". Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) awarded the band members, including Wilcher, with gold and platinum certificates for the album.|$|E
500|$|Blofeld {{makes his}} third {{appearance}} in the Bond series in You Only Live Twice and Benson notes that on this occasion <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> mad and egocentric in his behaviour; Tanaka refers to him as [...] "a devil who has taken human form". Comentale, Watt and Willman note that Fleming, through Bond, parallels Blofeld with Caligula, Nero and Hitler, and that this exemplifies Blofeld's actions as being on [...] "a titanic scale", {{as much of the}} criminal action was throughout the Bond series. Linder echoes this, noting that the crimes perpetrated are not against individuals per se, but entire nations or continents.|$|E

So now, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> positive just where his house should <b>be,</b> <b>he</b> swam around the pond to make doubly sure. Then, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> satisfied, <b>he</b> swam over to the place he had chosen. It was where the water <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> deep.|$|R

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> willing to remain with us." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxygène {{initially}} proved {{difficult to}} sell. Jarre {{was turned down}} by several record companies, until another of Schaeffer's students, Hélène Dreyfus, persuaded her husband to publish the album on his label, Disques Motors. The first pressing of 50,000copies was promoted through hi-fi shops, clubs and discos, and by April 1977 the album had sold 70,000copies in France. When interviewed in Billboard magazine, Dreyfus's director Stanislas Witold said [...] "In a sense we're putting most of our bets on Jean-Michel Jarre. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> exceptional and we're sure that by 1980 he will be recognised worldwide." [...] Oxygène has since sold an estimated 12million copies, the best-selling French record of all time. It reached number2 in the UK, number65 in Canada, and broke the top100 in the US. It also contains his most recognisable single, [...] "Oxygène IV", which reached number4 in the UK single charts.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World said, [...] "This well known story is rendered into a motion picture {{in a way}} that will please the most exacting. ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even an old story is attractive. The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> as good on the curtain as he is in the book, and there he has always been a favorite. The different parts are played to perfection. The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience." [...] The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are. The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and is apt to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out, and the strike scene is far from impressive. The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly, instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done." [...] Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers.|$|E

500|$|In Longacre's {{first years}} as chief engraver, no {{original}} designs were required for coins. [...] Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, {{and his successor}} had time to learn arts necessary for coin production {{that he had not}} needed as a maker of print engravings. [...] These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre [...] "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. [...] Indeed I do not know that he has ever made an attempt in this art." [...] By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had [...] "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. [...] He has shown too that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> competent to make the required model from his drawings." [...] Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.|$|E

[...] They are possessive of toys and food, and owner control is essential. [...] They are highly trainable and responsive to positive dog training techniques. [...] They do not respond well to punishment, and have 'a long memory.' [...] They are high energy dogs that require a lot of space.|$|E
