It is likely that in the 16th and 17th centuries {{they would have been}} occupied by the senior servants; the lower servants would <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> in any vacant corner or space on the ground or basement floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} wedding, Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), {{who wants}} another chance at Finn, {{suggests}} that he reveal that they had sex to boost his popularity at school. He is unwilling to do so, as he truly loves Rachel, who recently admitted to him that she lied when she claimed to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> with her then-boyfriend Jesse (Jonathan Groff); Finn also lied at the same time, by saying he never had sex with Santana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains are shaking, she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E

5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly {{was killed by a}} slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E

25|$|Human sleep needs vary {{by age and}} amongst individuals, {{and sleep}} is {{considered}} to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy, and those affected with sleep state misperception may typically report <b>having</b> <b>slept</b> only four hours despite <b>having</b> <b>slept</b> a full eight hours.|$|R

25|$|Reptiles have {{quiescent}} periods {{similar to}} mammalian sleep, and {{a decrease in}} electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals. In reptiles, sleep time increases following sleep deprivation, and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared to when they <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper.|$|E
25|$|The Rig Veda, in {{the tenth}} Mandala, {{contains}} a hymn {{in which they}} sing to each other. Yami proposes marriage to Yama but Yama flatly refuses as he considers it incest. The Atharva Veda also has {{a variant of the}} tale. In both texts, Yami argues that since they <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> together inside their mother's womb together, it was not wrong to sleep together outside it. However, the hymns abruptly end, without the final outcome being known. In later version of the tale, they are depicted as the first human beings and it is conjectured that Yami was successful in becoming Yama’s wife.|$|E
25|$|In 1865 at age 18, Nechayev {{moved to}} Moscow, {{where he worked}} for the {{historian}} Mikhael Pogodin. A year later, he moved to St. Petersburg, passed a teacher's exam and began teaching at a parish school. From September 1868, Nechayev attended lectures at St. Petersburg University (as an auditor, he was never enrolled) and became acquainted with the subversive Russian literature of the Decembrists, the Petrashevsky Circle, and Mikhail Bakunin, among others, as well as the growing student unrest at the university. Nechaev was even said to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> on bare wood and lived on black bread in imitation of Rakhmetov, the ascetic revolutionary in Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?.|$|E

25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, the Old House {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).|$|E
25|$|Richard Cotton's {{alterations}} to the Great Hall (now the library) {{are thought}} to include concealing the hammerbeam roof with a plaster ceiling and putting in a fireplace. Timbers {{in one of the}} bedrooms have been dated to around this time. It is unclear whether he installed a grand staircase to access the Hall, which is on the first floor. The room's existing screen is believed to date from somewhat later; it is known to have been moved at some point from its original northern position to {{the south side of the}} Hall, where it now stands. William III stayed at the house in 1690, while travelling to the Battle of the Boyne, and his visit may have been the cause of internal reorganisation. The room where the king is thought to <b>have</b> <b>slept,</b> known as the Orange Bedroom, is adjacent to the Great Hall; its timbers have been dated to 1546–81. There is also evidence for building work in around 1725.|$|E
500|$|Part IV {{consists}} {{of only one}} chapter, which, like the book's opening chapter, is mostly composed {{of a series of}} seemingly unrelated vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder of the chapter {{consists of}} the vignettes [...] "Saint Kevin", [...] "Berkely and Patrick" [...] and [...] "The Revered Letter". ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband, declaring [...] "Rise up, man of the hooths, you <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> so long!", and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.|$|E

500|$|The {{occupation}} of Serbia by the Central Powers pained Bojić {{far more than}} the everyday struggles of the exodus itself. He is said to <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> very little, telling Živadinović: [...] "You don't realize what you are missing by sleeping. In circumstances like these, the entire soul must be kept constantly awake. Whole centuries have never painted such a vast fresco. Never has death been so greedy, nor heroes so indifferent to it." [...] In December 1915, Bojić reached Shëngjin with the others and reunited with his fiancée. Živadinović recalled: [...] "I shall never forget the day that we saw the sea. Only then did Bojić begin to speak about the future. He was making plans for a vast novel in verse, for comedies, dramas, tragedies, all intended to bring the great events of our history back to life." [...] Upon reaching the coast, Bojić was told that he could not board the ship to Italy because he was of fighting age. His fiancée was allowed to board and his fifteen-year-old brother was judged to be too young for military service and granted passage as well. Unable to go with them, Bojić and his companions continued {{down the length of the}} Albanian coast until they reached Corfu, where the Allies had sent ships to transport the remnants of the Serbian Army to the Greek mainland.|$|E

Wheeler told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that Nicola calls Ivan for [...] "some comfort" [...] and they get drunk and [...] "very cosy"; but Ivan presumes they are just good friends. Ivan {{gets out of the}} shower wearing a towel and is confronted with Nicola [...] "dressed in her sexiest underwear". Ivan tells Nicola to stop because he loves Paul, but Simon's mother Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) walks in on them and assumes that they are having an affair. Nicola does not correct Lesley and tells her to believe what she likes and then Paul learns of the situation. Wheeler said that Nicola realises she cannot [...] "get out of the lie now" [...] and even tells her father, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) that she has slept with Ivan. The actress added that [...] "Nicola's just quite pleased with the fact that she's got her own back on Ivan". He confronts her in public and asks her to tell the truth, but she [...] "turns on the waterworks" [...] to get everyone to turn against Ivan. Later Nicola argues with Paul and she tells him that she and Ivan <b>have</b> <b>slept</b> together many times. Wheeler said that Nicola just thinks [...] "Sod it, I'm going to leave them all stewing". Her lies ruin Ivan's relationship with Paul, who believes Nicola's lies.|$|E
