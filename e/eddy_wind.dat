40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Saturn exhibits dynamical structures (jets, bands, spots, eddies) with horizontal scales ranging from one scale height (60 km) {{up to the}} planetary radius (60, 000 km). Although the kinds of structures {{are the same as}} those on Jupiter, there are quantitative differences. First, Saturn's equatorial jet speed is four times greater and the jet width is two times wider than on Jupiter. Eastward jets at higher latitudes are also speedier and wider, but westward jets are slower compared with Jupiter. There are fewer spots in all size ranges, and no spot comparable in size to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The rms <b>eddy</b> <b>wind</b> speed is lower, as is the conversion of eddy kinetic energy to zonal mean kinetic energy (the measured rate of conversion is positive but not significantly so). Saturn's convective regions, where eddy lifetimes are a few days or less, are more isolated and cover less area than on Jupiter. The basic causes of these differences have not been quantitatively identified. Basic differences between the two planets include Saturn's lower heat source, lower gravity, and consequently greater depth of atmosphere and deeper nonconducting fluid layers. Observed temperatures imply that the zonal winds decrease from cloud top upwards, but change more gradually below the cloud tops. One possibility is that zonal winds are constant on concentric cylinders that extend throughout the planet. However the observations, which are limited to cloud-top altitudes and above, do not preclude other configurations. It is remotely possible that Saturn's internal rate of rotation is different from that of its radio emissions. Dynamical models differ in their assumption about the interior and its dynamical interaction with the atmosphere. The time-dependent behavior of the large-scale structures offers a promising way of testing the models and choosing among the various assumptions...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic is an {{important}} component of the Earth’s climate system, and it is a region dynamically coupled to climate phenomena at lower latitudes, through both atmospheric and oceanic paths. The coupling has significant effects on the hydroclimate variability in the Arctic, including effects on sea ice and Arctic precipitation. In this dissertation, we explore the coupling of the lower latitudes and the Arctic hydroclimate through atmospheric mechanisms with dynamical and thermodynamical components, with a focus on the following examples of variability: i) the decadal variability of boreal winter Arctic precipitation, ii) the variability of the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex in boreal winter, and iii) the initial melt of Arctic sea ice in late boreal spring. The goal of the research is to understand what drives the Arctic hydroclimate variability in each of these examples through improved knowledge of the mechanisms linking them to the tropics and Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. In the first part of the analysis, we explore the mechanisms responsible for the decadal variability of boreal winter Arctic precipitation. We find that the decadal variability of cool-season Arctic precipitation is at least partly connected to decadal modulation of tropical central Pacific sea surface temperatures related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The modulation can be described as the oscillation between periods favoring central and eastern Pacific warming events [CPW and EPW, respectively], which are two common types of ENSO variability. By analyzing a collection of CPW and EPW events in reanalysis data, we establish the following connecting mechanism. First, the increase of central Pacific SSTs drive a Rossby wave train that destructively interferes with the zonal wavenumber 1 component of the background extratropical planetary wave in the subpolar region. Next, as a result of this interference, the magnitude of the vertical Rossby wave propagation from the troposphere to the stratosphere decreases and the stratospheric polar vortex strengthens. Finally, the strengthening of the vortex translates into a tendency towards a positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) in the troposphere and a poleward shift of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude storm tracks, increasing moisture transport from lower latitudes and increasing total Arctic precipitation. In a further investigation of a crucial component of the above mechanism, the initial response of the stratospheric polar vortex to the influence of CPW and EPW is investigated. A 20 -member ensemble run of an idealized model experiment in the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is conducted with prescribed CPW and EPW pattern SST anomalies. Both CPW and EPW events weaken the polar vortex in the ensemble mean. The weakening is mainly tied to changes in the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation, with some contribution from eddy momentum flux convergence. There is a significant spread between ensemble members with identical CPW and EPW forcing, where a few of the ensemble members exhibit a weak strengthening response. The initial conditions of the extratropical atmosphere and subsequent internal variability after the introduction of the CPW and EPW forcing help drive the spread in response between individual members. In the last part of the analysis, using MERRA reanalysis data, the means by which atmospheric eddies affect the trend and variability of the initial melt of Arctic sea ice are explored. We focus specifically on the effects of lower troposphere (i. e. 1000 - 500 mb average) meridional heat transport by atmospheric eddies, a dynamical component of the atmospheric eddy mechanism, and eddy-generated surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation anomalies, a thermodynamical component. Although in a climatological sense, atmospheric eddies in all major frequency bands transport heat poleward into the Arctic, we find that the lower-troposphere eddy meridional heat transport does not contribute to the trend of an earlier initial melt date. However, eddy heat transport still plays {{an important}} role in the initialization of individual episodes of initial melt with large areal coverage. In the investigation of two specific episodes, the meridional heat transport term that represents the interaction between the <b>eddy</b> <b>wind</b> and mean temperature fields (i. e. the product of the meridional <b>eddy</b> <b>wind</b> and the mean temperature fields) is most associated with the initial melt in both episodes. Additionally, melt in one of the episodes is also associated with surface downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation anomalies, a result of eddy-generated cloud cover anomalies. Therefore, in individual melt events, the combination of direct eddy meridional heat transport and surface longwave and eddy-driven shortwave radiation anomalies may significantly contribute to the initial melt of Arctic sea ice. This combination may be especially important in episodes where significant initial melt occurs over a large area and over a period of a few days. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} of the stratospheric wave driving during northern winter is often quantified by the Jan. -Feb. mean poleward eddy heat flux at 100 hPa, averaged over 40 Deg- 80 Deg N (or a similar area and period). Despite the dynamical and chem. relevance of the wave driving, the causes for its variability are still not well understood. In this study, ERA- 40 reanal. data for the period 1979 - 2002 are used to examine several factors that significantly affect the interannual variability of the wave driving. The total poleward heat flux at 100 hPa is poorly correlated with that in the troposphere, suggesting a decoupling between 100 hPa and the troposphere. However, the individual zonal wave- 1 and wave- 2 contributions to the wave driving at 100 hPa do exhibit a significant coupling with the troposphere, predominantly their stationary components. The stationary wave- 1 contribution to the total wave driving significantly depends on the latitude of the stationary wave- 1 source in the troposphere. The results suggest that this dependence is assocd. with the varying ability of stationary wave- 1 activity to enter the tropospheric waveguide at mid-latitudes. The wave driving anomalies are sepd. into three parts: one part due to anomalies in the zonal correlation coeff. between the eddy temp. and <b>eddy</b> meridional <b>wind,</b> another part due to anomalies in the zonal eddy temp. amplitude, and a third part due to anomalies in the zonal <b>eddy</b> meridional <b>wind</b> amplitude.

40|$|Abstract: Transformers {{are major}} {{components}} in power {{systems and the}} main impact of harmonics on transformers {{is an increase in}} the rated power losses that results in temperature rise inside the transformers.

The contributing factors that cause the increase in transformer losses due to harmonics are an increase in rms current, an increase in the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> currents caused by proximity effect, and an increase in other stray losses.

40|$|The {{strength}} of the stratospheric wave driving during northern winter is often quantified by the January&ndash;February mean poleward eddy heat flux at 100 hPa, averaged over 40 &deg;&ndash; 80 &deg; N (or a similar area and period). Despite the dynamical and chemical relevance of the wave driving, the causes for its variability are still not well understood. In this study, 45 years of ERA- 40 reanalysis data are used to examine several factors that significantly affect the interannual variability of the wave driving. The total poleward heat flux at 100 hPa is poorly correlated with that in the troposphere, suggesting a decoupling between 100 hPa and the troposphere. However, the individual zonal wave- 1 and wave- 2 contributions to the wave driving at 100 hPa do exhibit a significant coupling with the troposphere, predominantly due to their stationary components. The stationary wave- 1 contribution to the total wave driving significantly depends on the latitude of the stationary wave- 1 source in the troposphere. The results suggest that this dependence {{is associated with the}} varying ability of stationary wave- 1 activity to enter the tropospheric waveguide at mid- to subpolar latitudes. If composites of strong and weak wave-driving years are compared, we find significantly higher refractive index values in the midlatitude stratosphere for the strong composite than for the weak composite. Since wave activity tends to propagate towards higher refractive index values, this could explain part of the interannual variability of the wave driving. Finally, an alternative approach is taken, in which the wave driving anomalies are separated into three parts: one part due to anomalies in the zonal correlation between the eddy temperature and <b>eddy</b> meridional <b>wind,</b> another part due to anomalies in the zonal eddy temperature amplitude, and a third part due to anomalies in the zonal <b>eddy</b> meridional <b>wind</b> amplitude.

40|$|Submesoscale eddies {{generated}} by baroclinic instability of upper ocean fronts lead to rapid restratification of the mixed {{layer on a}} time scale of days. This restratification can be opposed by a down-front wind stress (acting {{in the direction of}} the geostrophic velocity) that drives a surface Ekman flow from the dense side to the light side of the front to arrest the slumping of isopycnals. A scaling diagnostic is suggested to determine whether the effect of <b>eddies</b> or <b>wind</b> dominates under different conditions. Using a numerical model, we investigate the juxtaposition of submesoscale <b>eddies</b> and down-front <b>winds</b> acting on the mixed layer.

Though the cross-front transport of buoyancy induced by the down-front component of the wind opposes restratification by mixed layer eddies, it becomes diminished as the eddies and growth of the frontal instability disrupt alignment between the wind and frontal axis.

40|$|M. Ing. The study {{looks into}} the impact of {{harmonic}} distortion on power-plant equipment in general, and then focuses on the impact it has on power transformers operating near the thermal limit. The feasibility {{of the study is}} firstly evaluated and then the theory on harmonics and transformer losses is analysed. The study had been narrowed down to power transformers due to the high numbers of failures nationally and internationally attributed to unknown causes. A transformer model is then developed through theoretical considerations. Finally, a case study is done on the capability of a fully loaded transformer under harmonics conditions evaluated through transformer capability calculations and the proposed transformer model. Thereafter the transformer model developed is verified with measured results. The main impact of harmonic current distortion on power transformers is an increase in the rated power losses that results in a temperature rise inside the power transformer. The heat build-up can lead to degradation of insulation, which can shorten the transformer’s life and lead to eventual breakdown. The harmonic current distortion impacts transformer losses – namely, ohmic losses, the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses and other stray losses. All of these harmonic effects on transformer losses are verified theoretically, mathematically and practically. The harmonic impact on the transformer capability is then evaluated through a numerical example of a transformer feeding a harmonic load. The transformer capability is determined via two methods – namely, harmonic capability calculations in the standard “IEEE Recommended Practice for Establishing Transformer Capability when Supplying Nonsinusoidal Load Currents”, [11] and a proposed transformer model derived from theoretical and mathematical analysis. The results show that an increase in the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses can decrease the maximum permissible nonsinusoidal load current substantially. If the load current of the transformer is derated accordingly it translates into a loss of the output power capacity of the power transformer. The standard recommended capability calculations for <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses are conservative and not satisfactorily accurate. This results in a large loss of power capacity. The proposed transformer model includes a parameter that estimates the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current loss in the transformer that results in a smaller loss in power capacity. Furthermore, it was shown that the harmonic current distortion levels could exceed the permissible levels although the harmonic voltage distortion levels are within acceptable levels. The proposed transformer equivalent model is thereafter practically verified with experimental results of papers published by M. A. S. Masoum, E. F. Fuchs and D. J. Roesler, [19], [20] and [29]...|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the seasons gradually rolled on. The little frogs that had piped in the meadows in early spring, croaked as bull-frogs in the brooks {{during the summer}} heats, and then sunk into silence. The peach tree budded, blossomed, and bore its fruit. The swallows and martins came, twittered about the roof, built their nests, reared their young, held their congress along the eaves, and then winged their flight in search of another spring. The caterpillar spun its winding-sheet, dangled in it from the great buttonwood tree that shaded the house, turned into a moth, fluttered with the last sunshine of summer, and disappeared; and finally {{the leaves of the}} buttonwood tree turned yellow, then brown, then rustled one by one to the ground, and whirling about in little <b>eddies</b> of <b>wind</b> and dust, whispered that winter was at hand.|$|R

He tried to smoke, but found no comfort in it after he had with difficulty lighted his pipe; {{he did not feel}} inclined to talk, and {{it was a relief to}} him when Lisle sank into slumber.|$|R
