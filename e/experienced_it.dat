5|$|Most of {{the women}} who {{reported}} homosexual activity had not <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> more than ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Generalmajor Richard Heidrich, the 1st Parachute Division {{consisted}} of the 1st, 3rd and 4th Parachute Regiments, with an artillery regiment, tank-destroyer, anti-aircraft, and engineer battalions, and other support units. The division was the successor of the original German airborne force, the 7th Air Division, and was highly <b>experienced.</b> <b>It</b> had spearheaded the German invasion in the west in 1940, and fought in the battles of Greece and Crete, and in the Soviet Union. Withdrawn from the Soviet Union in 1943, the division had already fought against British paratroops during operations in Sicily. However, on 9 September only three combat battalions and the headquarters were in Apulia.|$|E
5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they <b>experienced</b> <b>it.</b> Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E

25|$|Moby-Dick {{contains}} large sections—most of them {{narrated by}} Ishmael—that seemingly {{have nothing to}} do with the plot, but describe aspects of the whaling business. Although a successful earlier novel about Nantucket whalers had been written, Miriam Coffin or The Whale-Fisherman (1835) by Joseph C. Hart, which is credited with influencing elements of Melville's work, most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny, and Melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate a way as he had <b>experienced</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Limerence is {{characterized}} by intrusive thinking and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense joy or as extreme despair, {{depending on whether the}} feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned passion or love, {{even to the point of}} addictive-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never <b>experienced</b> <b>it,</b> and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.|$|E

25|$|Both {{boys and}} girls could {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> more frequently. Members of the school community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls {{on their way to}} and from school. In some cases, this could involve sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. Girls could be abducted for marriage which meant the man did not have to pay a bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E
25|$|Adolescence {{represents}} {{a period of}} unique vulnerability for developing addiction. Not only are adolescents more likely to initiate and maintain drug use, but once addicted they are more resistant to treatment and more liable to relapse. Statistics have shown that those who start to drink alcohol {{at a younger age}} are more likely to become dependent later on. About 33% of the population tasted their first alcohol between the ages of 15 and 17, while 18% <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> prior to this. As for alcohol abuse or dependence, the numbers start off high with those who first drank before they were 12 and then drop off after that. For example, 16% of alcoholics began drinking prior to turning 12 years old, while only 9% first touched alcohol between 15 and 17. This percentage is even lower, at 2.6%, for those who first started the habit after they were 21.|$|E
25|$|As {{mounting}} evidence, {{from all}} sorts of intelligence sources and from observation of ground movements, indicated that the Germans were suffering desperate local shortages, the tactical air forces intensified their attacks on oil trains and storage dumps near the front lines. The Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces showed improvement {{in the use of}} H2X radar devices, and RAF Bomber Command was employing Gee-H to better advantage as its crews became more <b>experienced.</b> <b>It</b> was discovered that synthetic oil plants lent themselves to successful air attacks more easily than oil refineries, since the former could be put out of action by relatively small damage to critical parts of their complicated machinery. Furthermore, the synthetic plants were much larger than the refineries and were more likely to appear on radar screens because they usually stood some distance outside of cities. The 15AF sharply raised its level of accuracy and developed techniques, {{such as the use of}} diamond-shaped formations, which ensured more safety for the bombers as well as greater precision in attack.|$|E

25|$|Ottoman rule {{ended in}} 1630, when the Zaydis took over Yemen. Jews {{were once again}} persecuted. In 1679, {{under the rule of}} Al-Mahdi Ahmad, Jews were {{expelled}} en masse from all parts of Yemen to the distant province of Mawza, and many Jews died there of starvation and disease as consequence. As many as two-thirds of the exiled Jews did not survive. Their houses and property were seized, and many synagogues were destroyed or converted into mosques. This event was later known as the Mawza exile, and it is recalled in many writings of the Yemenite Jewish rabbi and poet Shalom Shabazi, who <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> himself. About a year after the expulsion, the survivors were allowed to return for economic reasons; Jews were the majority of craftsmen and artisans, and thus a vital asset in the country's economy. However, they were not allowed to return to their former homes, and found that most of their religious articles had been destroyed. They were instead resettled in special Jewish quarters outside the cities.|$|E
500|$|Ocean {{titled the}} album as a {{reference}} to grapheme-color synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon in which an individual's perception of numbers and letters {{is associated with the}} experience of colors. He discussed the phenomenon with Pharrell, who had also <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> and similarly referenced it for the title of his side project N.E.R.D's 2008 album Seeing Sounds. West also <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> as a youth and used it as an inspiration when creating his short film Cruel Summer in 2012. The title also alludes to the first time that Ocean fell in love, as it was summer and he perceived everything to be orange. Ocean's mother called it [...] "a perfect summertime album" [...] after attending a listening session.|$|E

500|$|Solar plants' {{reliable}} solid-state systems require minimal maintenance, {{compared to}} rotating machinery for example. [...] A major {{aspect of the}} O contract will be continuous monitoring {{of the performance of}} the plant and all of its primary subsystems, which is normally undertaken remotely. [...] This enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually <b>experienced.</b> <b>It</b> also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance. A small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter or maximizer for each solar panel, which provide individual performance data that can be monitored. For other solar farms, thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement.|$|E
500|$|Reger {{completed}} {{the composition of}} the psalm in May to August 1909. The work was published by Peters in Leipzig, first the vocal score with piano in September 1909, with the piano reduction prepared by Reger himself. The score and the parts appeared in December that year. The complete work was premiered simultaneously on 23 February 1910 in both Chemnitz and Breslau. In Chemnitz, Reger conducted the church choir of St. Lukas and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, [...] conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the journal NMZ: [...] "" [...] (Still under the impression of what we heard and <b>experienced,</b> <b>it</b> is unspeakably difficult for me to express here all the deeply experienced, the sublime and divine of that hour.

Jeanine Basinger notes that critics <b>experienced</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in James Wolcott's words, a [...] "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films have always been [...] "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war". Its success revived interest in World War II films.
