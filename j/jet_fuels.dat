25|$|Solazyme {{is one of}} {{a handful}} of {{companies}} which is supported by oil companies such as Chevron. Additionally, this company is also backed by Imperium Renewables, Blue Crest Capital Finance, and The Roda Group. Solazyme has developed a way to use up to 80% percent of dry algae as oil. This process requires the algae to grow in a dark fermentation vessel and be fed by carbon substrates within their growth media. The effect is the production of triglycerides that are almost identical to vegetable oil. Solazyme's production method is said to produce more oil than those algae cultivated photosynthetically or made to produce ethanol. Oil refineries can then take this algal oil and turn it into biodiesel, renewable diesel or <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|E
500|$|In December 2008 an Air New Zealand jet {{completed}} the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel. [...] More {{than a dozen}} performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport. A biofuel blend of 50:50 jatropha and Jet A1 fuel was used to power one of the Boeing 747-400's Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Air New Zealand set several criteria for its jatropha, requiring that [...] "the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous 20 years, that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable {{for the majority of}} food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated". The company has also set general sustainability criteria, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional <b>jet</b> <b>fuels,</b> and that they should be cost competitive.|$|E

Airline Industry Mengdong He This study {{examines}} {{the relation between}} <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging and firm value using a sample of 36 publicly-traded U.

We then focus our analyses on the specific ways in which <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging by airlines can affect firm value. Specifically, we investigate the effect of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging on firm value based on different hedging levels, different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> exposures, different hedger types, different operating costs spent on <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> and different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> price volatility.

40|$|AbstractJet fuel {{is a kind}} of {{hazardous}} chemical and it can easily result in combustion or explosion accidents in the process of production, use, storage, transportation and other aspects, so its safety issues are essential and urgent. Explosion performance testing device and combustion performance testing device have been used to study the combustion and explosion characteristics of high flash point <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> and No. 3 <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> The results show that the explosion pressure and explosion pressure rise rate have a rising trend with the spray pressure increases. The ignition time of high flash point <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> was later than that of No. 3 <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> showing that high flash point <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> is more safety than No. 3 <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> The obtained combustion and explosion parameters of the two kinds of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> from the experiments can be used to evaluate their safety quantitatively...|$|R

2500|$|Excises (or {{exemptions}} from them) {{are also}} used to modify consumption patterns of a certain area (social engineering). For example, a high excise is used to discourage alcohol consumption, relative to other goods.

Similar taxes may exist on tobacco, pornography, etc., and they may be collectively referred to as [...] "sin taxes". A carbon tax is a tax on the consumption of carbon-based non-renewable fuels, such as petrol, diesel-fuel, <b>jet</b> <b>fuels,</b> and natural gas.

2500|$|The U-2 {{has used}} Jet Propellant Thermally Stable (JPTS) since the aircraft's {{development}} in the 1950s. JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude fuel, created specifically as fuel for the U-2. JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard Air Force fuels. In 1999, the United States Air Force spent approximately $11.3 million on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and {{was looking for a}} lower cost alternative. JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the per-gallon price of the Air Force's primary jet fuel, JP-8. Research is under way to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, is being considered.

Due to its increasing share of greenhouse gas emissions, aviation has been thrust into the spotlight as an industry {{with the potential to}} abate carbon emissions. Despite collaborative intentions, many countries cannot come to an agreement for aviation standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets. In projecting <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption levels in 2030 and 2050, I hope to create the basis upon which discussions for setting <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption policy can begin.

40|$|Hydrocarbon residues, {{microbial}} numbers, and microbial activity {{were measured}} and correlated in loam soil contaminated by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> spills resulting in 50 and 135 mg of hydrocarbon g of soil− 1. Contaminated soil was incubated at 27 °C either as well-aerated surface soil or as poorly aerated subsurface soil. In the former case, {{the effects of}} bioremediation treatment on residues, microbial numbers, and microbial activity were also assessed. Hydrocarbon residues were measured by quantitative gas chromatography. Enumerations included direct counts of metabolically active bacteria, measurement of mycelial length, plate counts of aerobic heterotrophs, and most probable numbers of hydrocarbon degraders. Activity was assessed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis. <b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> disappeared much more rapidly from surface soil than it did from subsurface soil. In surface soil, microbial numbers and mycelial length were increased by 2 to 2. 5 orders of magnitude {{as a result of}} <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> contamination alone and by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude {{as a result of the}} combination of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> contamination and bioremediation. FDA hydrolysis was stimulated by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> and bioremediation, but was inhibited by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> alone. The latter was traced to an inhibition of the FDA assay by <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> biodegradation products. In subsurface soil, oxygen limitation strongly attenuated microbial responses to <b>jet</b> <b>fuel.</b> An increase in the most probable numbers of hydrocarbon degraders was accompanied by a decline in other aerobic heterotrophs, so that total plate counts changed little.

50|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>fuel</b> {{is often}} used in ground support {{vehicles}} at airports, instead of diesel. The United States military makes heavy use of JP-8, for instance.
