40|$|Objectives: Spatial {{assessment}} of traffic noise pollution intensity will provide urban planners with approximate estimation of citizens exposure to impermissible sound levels. They could identify critical noise pollution areas wherein noise barriers should be embedded. The present study aims at using the Geographic Information System (GIS) to assess spatial changes in traffic noise pollution in Tehran, {{the capital of}} Iran, and the largest city in the Middle East. Material and Methods: For this purpose, while measuring equivalent sound levels at different time periods of a day and different days of a week in District 14 of Tehran, wherein there are highways and busy streets, the geographic coordination of the measurement points was recorded at the stations. The obtained {{results indicated that the}} <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> did not show a statistically significant difference between weekdays, and morning, afternoon and evening hours as well as time intervals of 10 min, 15 min and 30 min. Then, 91 stations were selected in the target area and <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was measured for each station on 3 occasions of the morning (7 : 00 – 9 : 00 a. m.), afternoon (12. 00 – 3 : 00 p. m.) and evening (5 : 00 – 8 : 00 p. m.) on Saturdays to Wednesdays. Results: As the results suggest, the maximum <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (Leq) was reported from Basij Highway, which is a very important connecting thoroughfare in the district, and was equal to 84. 2 dB(A), while the minimum <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (Leq), measured in the Fajr Hospital, was equal to 59. 9 dB(A). Conclusions: The average <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was higher than the national standard limit at all stations. The use of sound walls in Highways Basij and Mahallati as well as widening the Streets 17 th Shahrivar, Pirouzi and Khavaran, benchmarked on a map, were recommended as the most effective mitigation measures.

However, data regarding the acute effects of different styles of music on cardiac autonomic regulation are lacking. The literature has indicated that auditory stimulation with white noise above 50 dB induces cardiac responses. We aimed to evaluate the acute effects of classical baroque and heavy metal music of different intensities on cardiac autonomic regulation. Study design: The study was performed in 16 healthy men aged 18 - 25 years. All procedures were performed in the same soundproof room. We analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) in time (standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals [SDNN], root-mean square of differences [RMSSD] and percentage of adjacent NN intervals with a difference of duration greater than 50 ms [pNN 50]) and frequency (low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF] and LF/HF ratio) domains. HRV was recorded at rest for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the volunteers were exposed {{to one of the}} two musical styles (classical baroque or heavy metal music) for five minutes through an earphone, followed by a five-minute period of rest, and then they were exposed to the other style for another five minutes.

Mesurements for four hours was done at eight schools set north and south of the city centre. The measurement period included one school break and one lunch break. The results of the measurements were that the equivalent and maximum sound level had small variations between the schools with some exceptions. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> was Leq 58 - 62 dB(A) and this shows a small variation. The school with the highest <b>equivalent</b> <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> of 67 dB was Maria skolan. This high level can be explained by more children on the school yard together at the same time etc. The maximum sound level was 85 - 89 dB(A), this if the level for Sofia skolan 82 dB was ignored. The level 85 - 89 dB(A) also shows a small variation. Calculations of the sound reduction index (R'w) for facade elements were also carried out for all the schools. The resulting sound reduction index for the whole facade was 34 - 41 dB. After assuming a 200 mm thick concrete facade for Sjöstadsskolan another calculation of building elements gives that the window have to reduce R'w 32 dB to meet the indoor requirements.
