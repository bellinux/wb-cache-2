5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> secondary reference electrode.|$|E

In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> {{major source}} of variation, {{mutation}} may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities {{at the molecular level}} for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
