40|$|Abstract. The Effect of intercritical quencing on {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} properties of ultra low <b>carbon</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> were studied by utilizing SEM, TEM, tensile and impact tests. The specimens were firstly subjected to an annealing treatment at 930 o C followed by quenching to ambient temperature, then were repeatedly annealing at the temperatures being varied {{in the range}} of 600 ~ 870 o C, and then repeatedly quenched to ambient temperature in cold water. When the intercritical quenching was just slightly above Ac 1, the strength and low temperature toughness were remarkably deteriorated attributing to the massive grain and some twins in the bainite islands. However, the more when the annealing temperature increased higher than Ac 1 but still below Ac 3, the more regions can be austenized, which cause the average of carbon content in the austenized regions to be relatively low. So it was difficult that these austenite regions changed into twin martensites after interctitical quenched. Then the comprehensive properties including low temperature toughness became good again...|$|R
