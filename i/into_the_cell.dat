5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.|$|E
5|$|The HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the {{adsorption}} of glycoproteins on {{its surface}} to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane {{and the release of}} the HIV capsid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in phospholipid and cholesterol homeostasis. After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase. ApoE may be the signalling ligand responsible for ApoER2's role in modulating the JNK signalling pathway.|$|E
30|$|A {{significant}} luminescence of SiNPs {{was observed}} in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> 24  h after their incubation. It is evident {{that the majority of}} SiNPs could penetrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> and locate in their cytoplasm. We assume that nanoparticles penetrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> due to <b>the</b> mechanism of endocytosis [41]. The localization of SiNPs in <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> cytoplasm was confirmed by z-scan imaging [see Additional file 1 : Movie S 1].|$|R

50|$|Sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) {{proteins}} are {{proteins that}} {{are bound to}} <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> membrane and have the role of transporting glucose through <b>the</b> membrane <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> against <b>the</b> concentration gradient of glucose. This is done by using the sodium gradient, produced by sodium/potassium ATPase pumps, so {{at the same time}} glucose is transported <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>the</b> Na+ is too. Since it is against the gradient, it requires energy to work. SGLT proteins cause the glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate, independent of insulin.|$|R
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances are taken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> whereas for exocytosis substances are {{moved from the}} cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|On July 7, {{the morning}} of Beauchamp's {{scheduled}} execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while she dressed. Anna tried another overdose on laudanum, {{but was unable to}} keep it down. She had smuggled a knife <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it. When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home and tended to by doctors.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA major {{system for}} net {{transepithelial}} secretion {{of a wide}} range of hydrophobic organic anions (OAs) exists in the proximal renal tubules of almost all vertebrates. This process involves transport <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> against an electrochemical gradient at the basolateral membrane and movement from <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lumen down an electrochemical gradient. Transport <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> at <b>the</b> basolateral membrane, which is the dominant, rate-limiting step, is a tertiary active transport process, the final step which involves countertransport of <b>the</b> OA <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> against its electrochemical gradient in exchange for α-ketoglutarate moving out of <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> down its electrochemical gradient. The outwardly directed gradient for α-ketoglutarate is maintained by metabolism (∼ 40 %) and by transport <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> across both <b>the</b> basolateral and luminal membranes by separate sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporters (∼ 60 %). The inwardly directed sodium gradient driving α-ketoglutarate uptake is maintained by the basolateral Na+–K+–ATPase, the primary energy-requiring transport step in the total tertiary process. The basolateral OA/α-ketoglutarate exchange process now appears to be physiologically regulated by several factors in mammalian tubules, including peptide hormones (e. g., bradykinin) and the autonomic nervous system acting via protein kinase C (PKC) pathways and epidermal growth factor (EGF) working via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway...|$|R

30|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a serious}} worldwide health problem associated with acute and chronic complications. In type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> ignore <b>the</b> insulin necessary {{for the use of}} glucose as an energy supply. Insulin takes the sugar from <b>the</b> blood <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> Diabetes complications occur when glucose builds up in the blood instead of going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> Diabetes mellitus has been proposed (Hooper & Hooper 2009) to be a vicious cycle of metabolically induced inflammation, impaired insulin responsiveness and loss of homeostatic signaling.|$|R
5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell,</b> allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E
5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} flexible reusable surface {{insulation material}} for future space shuttle flights was investigated. A conventional fly shuttle loom with special modifications to weave an integral double layer triangular core fabric from quartz yarn was used. Two types of insulating material were inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> of <b>the</b> fabric, and a procedure {{to accomplish this}} was developed. The program is follow up of a program in which single layer rectangular cell core fabrics are woven and a single type of insulating material was inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a potent cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor, on loading quin 2 acetoxymethyl ester (quin 2 /AM) and fura 2 /AM into smooth muscle cells {{isolated}} from guinea pig taenia coli was investigated spectrofluorometrically. The presence of DFP during the loading permitted {{the incorporation of}} quin 2 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells,</b> so that it became possible to measure intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations using the ester of this dye. Also, DFP significantly enhanced the incorporation of fura 2 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate that loading of quin 2 /AM and fura 2 /AM <b>into</b> <b>the</b> smooth muscle <b>cells</b> may depend on the suppression of ChE or various serine protease activities outside cells...|$|R
5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E
5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell.</b> Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

She hides in the closet and struggles to remain conscious. Mercer and Moe enter the room and are about to miss her, but Veronica’s cell phone rings and they knock her out. Parker (Julie Gonzalo) calls attention to Mercer. In addition to a bomb threat against Hearst, Dean O’Dell notices his window being egged before a mysterious man enters and the Dean asks “What are you doing here?” Keith arrests Mercer and Moe. Logan intentionally gets himself arrested so he can go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> with Mercer and Moe.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded viral DNA that is then transported <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> nucleus. The integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
50|$|As we eat and glucose levels increase, insulin is {{released}} from <b>the</b> pancreas and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blood stream. Increased insulin levels cause the uptake of glucose <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cells.</b> GLUT4 {{is stored in}} <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> in transport vesicles, and is quickly incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plasma membrane of <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> when insulin binds to membrane receptors.|$|R

5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Hell in a Cell match between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. The match began with Michaels {{delivering}} a Thesz Press and slamming Triple H <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> wall, resulting in Triple H bleeding. Triple H got the advantage, {{as he was}} able to counter a piledriver and performed a back body drop on Michaels. Another attack saw Triple H hit Michaels with the steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. A spot in the match saw Michaels lay Triple H on a table, as he climbed onto a ladder that he took out from under the ring, and performed a diving elbow drop onto Triple H through the table. Afterwards, Triple H gained the advantage and performed a Pedigree on Michaels for the win. After the match, Michaels was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
