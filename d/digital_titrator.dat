30|$|Temperature, {{electrical}} conductivity (EC) and {{total dissolved solids}} (TDS) measurements were conducted in situ in the field by the HACH conductivity and pH metre. On-site testing of these variables was necessary since these parameters are likely to change during transport. HCO 3 − titration was done at the wellhead using a HACH <b>digital</b> <b>Titrator.</b> Sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were analysed using flame emission photometer (Sherwood model 420), magnesium (Mg 2 +) and calcium (Ca 2 +) using Varian AA 240 Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Chloride (Cl−), sulphate (SO 42 −) and nitrate (NO 3 −) were analysed using ICS- 90 ion chromatography at the Nuclear Chemistry and Environmental Research Centre, Ghana Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
40|$|Stress {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} health and social problems. Previous studies have demonstrated stress influence on the clinical course of a number of gastrointestinal diseases, but its physical and psychological effects on gastric acid and pepsin secretions are largely unknown. 48 male wistar rats weighing 200 - 250 gr were used in this study. Animals were divided into 6 groups (n= 8); Control, Physical stress, Psychological stress, L-NAME+ Physical stress and L-NAME+ Psychological stress groups. In this study, electrical shock generated in a communication box was used as physical shock and the emotional stress was as psychological stress. Gastric juice was collected by washout technique. Acid output was also measured by <b>digital</b> <b>titrator.</b> Gastric pepsin and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites were quantified using Anson and Griess micro assay methods respectively. Basal and stimulated gastric acid and pepsin in physical and psychological stress groups were significantly more than others. NO metabolites level of gastric tissue in physical and psychological stress groups (286. 9 ± 5. 8, 287. 7 ± 5. 7 μmol/gr weight wet tissue, respectively) were significantly more than other groups. But no significant differences among basal and stimulated gastric acid, pepsin and NO metabolites level were seen in physical and psychological stress groups...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{groundwater}} samples, namely, monitoring, domestic and hand dug wells from five districts were sampled. The sampling campaign {{was carried out}} in the dry season, in the months of October and November, 2013. In sampling from boreholes with hand pumps, purging was done for a minimum of 10  min to flush stagnant water retained in the pipes. In the case of hand dug wells, it was properly checked and confirmed that the well was being used daily. This was to ensure that stale and stagnant water was not sampled. All the water samples were collected in 250  mL preconditioned high-density polyethylene bottles. The bottles were conditioned by washing with 5  % nitric acid, and then rinsed several times with distilled water. This was carried out to ensure that the sampling bottles were free from contaminants. Temperature, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements were conducted in situ in the field by the HACH conductivity and pH meter. On-site testing of these variables was necessary since these parameters are likely to change during transport. Bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) titration was done at the well head using a HACH <b>digital</b> <b>titrator.</b> Sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were analysed using flame emission photometer (Sherwood model 420), magnesium (Mg 2 +) and calcium (Ca 2 +) using Varian AA 240 Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. Chloride (Cl−), sulphate (SO 4 2 −) and nitrate (NO 3 −) were analysed using ICS- 90 ion chromatography at the Nuclear Chemistry and Environmental Research Centre, Ghana Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
40|$|Agriculture, rapid {{urbanization}} and geochemical processes {{have direct}} or indirect effects on the chemical composition of groundwater and aquifer geochemistry. Hydrochemical investigations which are significant for assessment of water quality {{have been carried out}} to study the source of dissolve ions in the groundwater in some rural communities {{in the northern part of}} the Densu River basin. Twenty six samples comprising of twenty one boreholes, one hand-dug well and four surface waters were sampled for this study. The samples were analyzed in-situ for pH, Conductivity and salinity using a Hach potable meter, bicarbonate using a <b>digital</b> <b>titrator.</b> Major ions such as Na+, Ca 2 +, K+, SO 42 -, NO 3 -, Cl- etc were analyzed using ion-chromatography, flame photometer and Atomic Absorption spectrometer. The results showed that the groundwater in the study area are fresh and low in TDS (49. 5 - 361 mg/l) and generally mildly acidic to alkaline (pH 5. 57 - 7. 48). The ground water quality of the study area are suitable for domestic purposes, since most of the parameters measured were within the WHO recommended values for drinking water, with the exception of nitrate (NO 3 [...] N which showed an elevated concentration in most of the samples (about 60 %). Higher concentrations of NO 3 -, Cl-, SO 42 - etc were observed at the middle portion of the basin where there is extensive agriculture and rapid urbanization. The Piper diagram shows three major water types namely Na-Cl or Na-HCO 3 -Cl, Na-Mg-Ca-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3 water types and Ca-Mg-HCO 3 as minor about (8 %) which are moderately mineralized. Ion-exchange, Weathering, Oxidation and Dissolution of minerals were found to be the major geochemical processes governing the groundwater evolution in the study area...|$|E
30|$|Water {{samples were}} {{collected}} in July 2011 in the wet season and February 2012 in the dry season. Four streams, Canal (S 1), Lome (S 2), Odzador (S 3) and Okue (S 4), and 38 surface water samples on different locations on the lower Volta River were analyzed to determine the concentration of various parameters and stable isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 2 H). Locations of selected sampling sites were determined using the Garmin Vista CP GPS (Fig.  2). The R, M and L inserted in the location map represent the right, middle and left portions of the river. The numbers attached to R, M and L are the elevations above mean sea level. pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS) and bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 −) were measured in situ. Concentrations of the major cations (Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +) were determined in the laboratory after the samples had been treated with acid {{in the field to}} discourage bacterial action and oxidation processes. The water samples for anion (NO 3 −, PO 4 3 −, Cl− and SO 4 2 −) determination were filtered and collected into a 500  ml plastic container. Unfiltered water samples for stable isotope analysis (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) were collected into 60  mL glass bottles with poly-sealed lid, not acidified, and any remaining head space was topped off and capped tightly. The pH and temperature were determined using a (Ecoscan Ion 5) pH meter. EC, salinity and TDS were determined using a specific conductance meter (HACH SensIon 5). HCO 3 − was determined using HACH, Loveland Co. USA <b>digital</b> <b>titrator.</b> The chloride was determined by the argentometric method, sulfate by the turbidimetry method, phosphate by the vanadate molybdate method and nitrate by UV spectrophotometric method (APHA 1998). Sodium and potassium ions were determined by flame photometry (AWWA 1998).|$|E
30|$|A total 20 {{groundwater}} {{samples were}} collected from different locations {{of the study area}} (Fig.  1) from shallow tubewells. Most of the sampled wells were fitted with a standard Bangladesh number- 6 hand pump. Prior to sampling each well were pumped for few minutes until it purged out approximately twice the well volume, or until steady state chemical conditions (pH, EC and temperature) were obtained. pH of the water samples were measured on spot by using pH meter (EcoScan Ion- 6, Singapore); total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured by (HANNA HI 8734, Romania) portable meter. Electric conductivity (EC) and salinity were measured by portable EC meter (HANNA HI 8033, Romania). Temperature was also measured simultaneously by using the same TDS meter. The geographical location of each wells were determined with a GARMIN handheld global positioning system (GPS) and the approximate depth of wells were noted from the well owner’s records. Samples for major ion (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl–, SO 4 2 –, NO 3 – and HCO 3 −) analysis were collected in 500  mL polyethylene bottles. Each bottle was rinsed with distilled water before pouring the sample water. The bottles were labeled and air-tight. Two sets of {{samples were collected}} from each location and filtered through 0.45  μm cellulose nitrate hydrophilic syringe filters. Among them one was acidified using concentrated HNO 3 to reach a pH < 2 for preventing absorption and chemical precipitation. For ion analysis Gallenkamp Flame Analyzer was used for Na+ and K+ and, ICS- 5000 DIONEX SP, ion chromatography (IC) for Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl−, SO 4 2 −, and NO 3 − analysis. Samples were diluted several times and the relative standard deviation of measured major ions was found to be within ± 3 %. Alkalinity (HCO 3 −) was measured by titration method with <b>Digital</b> <b>Titrator</b> (16900, HACH International, Colorado, USA) and 1.6  N H 2 SO 4 cartridge.|$|E
