5|$|Having no {{children}} of his own, David adopted his kinsman, the young prince Bagrat, <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> the Bagratid throne of Kartli (Iberia).

Furthermore, through his mother Gurandukht, sister of the childless Abkhazian king Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential <b>heir</b> <b>to</b> the realm of Abkhazia. Making a plan for the creation of an all-Georgian state, David occupied Kartli for his foster-son in 976 and repulsed the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had recently occupied the western sector of Kartli with its rock-hewn city of Uplistsikhe.
