5000|$|HIV enters host {{cells in}} the blood by {{attaching}} itself to receptors {{on the surface of}} the CD4+ cell. [...] Viral entry to the CD4+ cell begins with attachment of the R5 HIV-1 <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>120</b> (gp120) to the CD4+ T-cell receptor, which produces a conformational change in gp120 and allows it to bind to CCR5, thereby triggering glycoprotein 41 (gp41) mediated fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and the nucleocapsid enters the host cell (Figure 1). CCR5 co-receptor antagonists prevent HIV-1 from entering and infecting immune cells by blocking CCR5 cell-surface receptor. Small molecule antagonists of CCR5 bind to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the transmembrane helices of the CCR5 receptor. [...] They are thought to interact with the receptor in an allosteric manner locking the receptor in a conformation that prohibits its co-receptor function.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{entry into}} CD4-positive cells commences when three {{subunits}} of a <b>glycoprotein</b> <b>120</b> (gp120) bind to CD4 receptor and a coreceptor. Glycoprotein gp120 is closely associated to a trimer of gp41 via van der Waals interactions. Upon binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and coreceptor, {{a number of}} conformational changes in the structure leads to the dissociation of gp120 and to the exposure of gp41 {{and at the same}} time to the anchoring of the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide sequence into the host cell. A spring-loaded mechanism is responsible for bringing the viral and cell membranes in close proximity that they will fuse. The origin of the spring-loaded mechanism lies within the exposed gp41, which contains two consecutive heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) following the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the protein. HR1 forms a parallel, trimeric coiled coil onto which HR2 region coils, forming the trimer-of-hairpins (or six-helix bundle) structure, thereby facilitating membrane fusion through bringing the membranes close to each other. The virus then enters the cell and begins its replication. Recently, inhibitors derived from HR2 such as Fuzeon (DP178, T-20) bind to the HR1 region on gp41 have been developed. However, peptides derived from HR1 have little viral inhibition efficacy due to the propensity for these peptides to aggregate in solution. Chimeras of these HR1-derived peptides with GCN4 leucine zippers have been developed and have shown to be more active than Fuzeon, but these have not entered the clinic yet.|$|E

HIV- 1 infection is initiated through a high-affinity interaction between the HIV- 1 external envelope <b>glycoprotein</b> (gp <b>120)</b> and the CD 4 receptor on T cells.
