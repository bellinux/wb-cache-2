50|$|In the end, {{the only}} CBM-II models to enter {{production}} and {{be sold to}} end users were the B128/600, B256/700, CBM-128/710, and PAL model P500s. The B128 and P500 were slimline models with no <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> or attached monitor while the CBM 128 and B256 were high-profile models. The B128 was the biggest selling of the three.|$|E
50|$|The NCR Voyager was an SMP {{computer}} platform {{produced by the}} NCR Corporation. It is MCA-based with NUMA. 486 and Pentium based. The Voyager architecture, or V'ger, reached its zenith with a 16-way SMP that scaled to {{the equivalent of about}} 6 CPUs. The Voyager architecture used a high overhead directory based cache cohererency scheme. There were several excellent aspects of the architecture, including power fail recovery, a large number of IO slots, up to 56 <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> and an excellent power subsystem.|$|E

50|$|The PX-8 did {{not have}} any <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> and instead allowed either memory to be {{partitioned}} into application memory and a RAM disk, or an external 60 KB or 120 KB intelligent RAM disk module to be attached (64K and 128K internally but some used for the processor). The intelligent RAM disk module had its own Z80 processor with a backup battery.|$|R
50|$|Loop {{recording}} is {{the process}} of recording audio continuously to an endless tape (if magnetic tape is used) or to computer memory, or recording video feeds (such as from video surveillance or camera signals) on a video server. This process is a never-ending one: {{at the end of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> the recording process continues to record at the beginning, erasing the previously recorded material and replacing it with the new content.|$|R
50|$|After the {{successful}} {{release of the}} CPC464, consumers were constantly asking for two improvements: more memory and an <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> For Amstrad, the latter was easier to realize. At the deliberately low-key introduction of the CPC664 in May 1985, the machine was positioned not only as the lowest-cost disk system but even the lowest-cost CP/M 2.2 machine. In the Amstrad CPC product range the CPC664 complemented the CPC464 which was neither discontinued nor reduced in price.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{principles}} of MythTV distributions and GeeXboX, Kodibuntu is designed to simplify a permanent installation of Kodi onto a computer {{to be used as}} a dedicated home theater PC in the living-room, as such the user can directly install XBMC from the bootable CD to either a USB flash drive or to an <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> as it comes with a complete instant-on (Linux kernel-based) embedded operating system. When installed onto a USB flash <b>drive</b> or <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> Kodibuntu has the ability to save settings and make updates to XBMC and the operating-system back onto the USB flash <b>drive</b> or hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> that it is installed onto.|$|R
5000|$|From a legal perspective, {{the term}} [...] "S.M.A.R.T."

Because of this the specifications of SMART are entirely vendor specific and, while many of these attributes have been standardized between drive vendors, others remain vendor-specific. SMART implementations still differ {{and in some cases}} may lack [...] "common" [...] or expected features such as a temperature sensor or only include a few select attributes while still allowing the manufacturer to advertise the product as [...] "SMART compatible." ...|$|R
25|$|This codename was {{assigned}} to a QL follow-on project running from 1984 to 1986. Among the features associated with Tyche were increased RAM capacity, <b>internal</b> floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> the Psion Xchange application suite on ROM, and possibly the GEM GUI.|$|R
50|$|Most hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> in {{the early}} 1980s were sold to PC end users by systems integrators such as the Corvus Disk System or the systems {{manufacturer}} such as the Apple ProFile. The IBM PC XT in 1983, included an internal standard 10MB hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> and soon thereafter <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> proliferated on personal computers.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, laptop {{computers}} were becoming popular among business people. The COMPAQ SLT/286 debuted in October 1988, being the first battery-powered laptop to support an <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and a VGA compatible LCD screen. It weighed 14 lbs.|$|R

2500|$|Expansion {{capabilities}} {{new to the}} Amiga line {{were the}} PCMCIA Type II slot and the internal 44-pin ATA interface both most commonly seen on laptop computers. Both interfaces are controlled by the 'Gayle' custom chip. The A600 has internal housing for one 2.5" [...] <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> connecting to the ATA controller.|$|R
5000|$|The 3B2 was {{introduced}} using the WE-32000 32-bit microprocessor with memory management chips that supported demand-paging. The 3B2 Model 300 was approximately 4 in {{high and the}} 3B2 Model 400 was approximately 8 in high. The 300 was soon supplanted by the 3B2/310, which featured the WE-32100 CPU as did all follow on models. The Model 400 allowed more peripheral slots and more memory. It also had a built-in 23 megabyte QIC tape drive managed by a floppy disk controller (nicknamed the [...] "floppy tape"). These three models used standard MFM 5¼" [...] hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> The 3B2/600 offered an improvement in performance and capacity. It featured a SCSI controller for the 60 megabyte QIC tape and two <b>internal</b> full-height <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> The 600 was approximately twice as tall as a 400, and was oriented with the tape and floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> opposite the backplane (instead of at a right angle to it as on the 3xx, 4xx and later 500 models). Early models used an internal Emulex card to interface the SCSI controller with ESDI disks, with later models using SCSI drives directly. The 3B2/500 was the next model to appear, essentially a 3B2/600 with enough components removed {{to fit into a}} 400 case. One <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and several backplane slots were sacrificed in this conversion. Unlike the 600 which, because of its two large fans was quite loud, the 500 was tolerable in an office environment, like the 400. The 3B2/700 was an uprated version of the 600 featuring a slightly faster processor. The 3B2/1000 was an additional step in this direction.|$|R
5000|$|The last use of {{the name}} was for the Quadra 630, which was a {{variation}} of the LC 630 using a [...] "full" [...] Motorola 68040 instead of the LC's 68LC040, and introduced together with it in 1994. The 630 was the first Mac to use an IDE based drive bus for the <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> whereas all earlier models had used SCSI.|$|R
50|$|The CPC664 {{features}} 64 KB RAM and an <b>internal</b> 3-inch floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> It {{was introduced}} in May 1985 in the UK. Initial suggested retail prices for the CPC664 were GBP£339.00/DM1198.00 with a green screen and GBP£449.00/DM1998.00 with a colour monitor.|$|R
50|$|The CPC6128 {{features}} 128 KB RAM and an <b>internal</b> 3-inch floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> Aside {{from various}} hardware and firmware improvements, {{one of the}} CPC6128's most prominent features is the compatibility with the CP/M+ operating system that rendered it attractive for business uses.|$|R
50|$|The PVR {{includes}} an <b>internal</b> 1TB hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> for recording programs. The PVR and wired HD receivers can {{be connected to}} the network through either a coaxial cable or Category 5 cable and the wireless HD receiver connects using 5 GHz 802.11n.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the portables (the Portable and Portable II) had CRT monitors, {{while others}} (the Portable III and the Portable 386) had flat, single-color, usually amber, plasma displays.

5000|$|MZ-2500 (SuperMZ) series: Launched in 1985, the {{computers}} {{in this series}} all used a Z80B processor running at 6 MHz. They included a data recorder {{and at least one}} 3.5 <b>internal</b> floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> as well as a YM2203 FM sound chip, hardware scrolling, and a palette of 256 colors (upgradable to 4096). This makes them among the most powerful 8-bit machines ever released for home use. Some models are also compatible with the MZ-80B and MZ-2000.|$|R
5000|$|The TX had a 3.5" [...] <b>internal</b> floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> {{mounted in}} a 5.25" [...] bay with {{room for an}} {{optional}} second internal 3.5" [...] or 5.25" [...] floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> It had ports for two joysticks in the front panel which included a volume control and an -inch headphone jack. The rear panel had the same ports as the 1000 SX except that an RS-232C serial port replaced the light-pen port. The memory size was 640 KB, with sockets for an additional 128 KB devoted to video frame buffering. The computer came bundled with Personal DeskMate 2.|$|R
5000|$|The Cromemco Z-2H {{computer}} {{was based on}} the Z-2D, but in addition had an 11 megabyte <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> [...] While the Z-2 and Z-2D had 21 S-100 slots, the Z-2H was limited to 12 expansion slots due {{to the size of the}} <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk.</b> Over 1000 Z-2H systems were sold in the first six months on the market. The 11-megabyte hard disks were also offered as a separate unit, the HDD, that could be used with a Z-2D computer. The HDD came with either one or two hard disks, for up to 22 megabytes of storage.|$|R
50|$|Puppy's {{compact size}} {{allows it to}} boot from any media that the {{computer}} can support. It can function as a live USB for flash devices or other USB mediums, a CD, an <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> an SD card, a Zip drive or LS-120/240 SuperDisk, through PXE, and through a floppy boot disk that chainloads the data from other storage media. It has also been ported to ARM and can run on a single board computer such as the Raspberry Pi.|$|R
50|$|The early models did {{not come}} with an {{internal}} CD-ROM drive, but these soon appeared as mobile technology progressed. Such models can link up with an external CD-ROM drive through the parallel port on the rear (since USB ports came later as well). Some Satellites also lacked an <b>internal</b> floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> but a port on the side allowed {{the use of a}} proprietary external module for such. These machines tended to be smaller in physical size than their contemporaries.|$|R
50|$|SCSI {{is popular}} on {{high-performance}} workstations, servers, and storage appliances. Almost all RAID subsystems on servers have used {{some kind of}} SCSI hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> for decades (initially Parallel SCSI, recently SAS and Fibre Channel), though a number of manufacturers offer SATA-based RAID subsystems as a cheaper option. Moreover, SAS offers compatibility with SATA devices, creating a much broader range of options for RAID subsystems together with the existence of nearline SAS (NL-SAS) drives. Instead of SCSI, modern desktop computers and notebooks typically use SATA interfaces for <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> with M.2 and PCIe gaining popularity as SATA can bottleneck modern solid-state drives.|$|R
5000|$|HD Receiver (6400) is a single-tuner HDTV {{receiver}} which decodes MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 signals. It offers both an HDMI and composite {{video output}} but removed component video output that was {{included on the}} 6131 model connectors for HDTV purposes. It does not include an <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> but can receive PVR capabilities when an external hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> is connected to its USB 2.0 port. The drive stores a one-hour data buffer, allowing one to rewind and pause a live TV program for that time period. [...] The iTV button on the 6400's remote {{has been replaced by}} a [...] "Movies" [...] button because the receiver does not support iTV.|$|R
40|$|Live {{operating}} systems and virtualisation allow a known, defined, {{safe and secure}} execution environment to be loaded in to a PC’s memory and executed with either minimal or possibly no reliance on the PC’s <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> The ability to boot a live operating system or load a virtual environment (containing an operating system) from a USB storage device allows a secure portable execution environment to be created. Portable execution environments have typically been used by technologists, for example to recover data from a failing PC <b>internal</b> hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> or to perform forensic analysis. However, with the commercial potential of portable execution environments becoming realised the requirement for such environments to be secure is becoming increasingly important. To be considered truly secure a portable execution environment should require authentication prior to loading the executing environment (from the USB mass storage device) and provide full encryption of the whole mass storage device. This paper discusses the outcomes from building four portable execution environments, using commercially available and/or freeware technologies. An overview is given of the emerging commercial requirement for secure portable USB execution environments, the security threats addressed and research performed in the area. The technologies and products considered in the review are outlined together with rationale behind th...|$|R
50|$|The 8-bit Swan SongDuring this period, three venerable 8-bit {{computers}} {{made something}} of a comeback, if short-lived. These were the Commodore 128 in January 1985 (and its variant C-128D a bit later), the Radio Shack Color Computer 3 in July 1986, and the Apple IIGS (whose CPU is a full 16-bit processor) in September 1986. They incorporated features typical of business-class computers like expanded memory beyond 64 kilobytes, 80 column text screens, higher resolution graphics with more colors, {{and in the case}} of the IIGS a Macintosh-like graphical interface. The C-128 had a Z80 chip for CP/M compatibility and the C-128D a PC-style case with an <b>internal</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> that could read and write data to PC disks. The new Coco could run a windowing, multitasking operating system called OS-9. Yet these updated veterans offered full compatibility with the software of their ancestors. Eventually these three, like all the other home computers, were eclipsed by the PCs due to constantly falling prices for the newer technologies. The three companies that opened the 8-bit home computer era in 1977, Tandy/Radio Shack, Apple, and Commodore, at last closed it.|$|R
