5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has {{cinnamon}} upperparts, brownish crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts. Its redder coloration and small size led German naturalist Ernst Hartert to <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a distinct taxon in 1906. The call is {{similar to those of}} the Australian subspecies.|$|E
5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions of Babylon. The British Museum and scholars of the period <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

Chris Smith writes in Boy Genius Report that {{just this one}} version of Android is affected {{but that it is}} a popular version of Android (Chitika claim 4.1.1 is on 50 million devices; Google <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> less than 10% of activated Android devices). Other Android versions are not vulnerable as they either have heartbeats disabled or use an unaffected version of OpenSSL.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E
5|$|No {{information}} on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' accounts from the 19thcentury. The British archaeologist Charles Fellows {{was the first to}} explore the region of Lycia, and visited the bridge in May1840. Fellows, as well as T.A.B. Spratt and Edward Forbes, who visited the site two years later, <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east. However, this mission failed to produce any plans or sketches of the site.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Gray in 1831 as the Chamaeleon cucullatus. Duméril and Bibron <b>described</b> <b>it</b> in 1836: 227 as Chamaeleo cucullatus, and Gray <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Bradypodium cucullatum in 1865: 351.

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a radical revolution.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé vary. Some legends <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{having an}} elephant-like {{body with a}} long neck and tail and a small head, a {{description}} which has been suggested to be similar in appearance {{to that of the}} extinct Sauropoda, while others <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> more closely resembling elephants, rhinoceros, and other known animals. It is usually described as being gray-brown in color. Some traditions, such as those of Boha Village, <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a spirit rather than a flesh and blood creature.|$|E
5000|$|It {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the}} Guardian <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a debut of rare accomplishment", and Strange Horizons <b>describing</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having [...] "a pretty good twisty plot {{at the core}} of the novel—but sadly ... buried underneath layers of cinematic flash-bang frippery and clunky long-winded exposition." [...] SF Signal <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "not always successful, but ... definitely a promising start." ...|$|R
5000|$|Perfect Sound Forever <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "an {{altogether}} {{more mature}} and unified work" [...] than Affenstunde. Head Heritage <b>described</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the most mind-blowing mystical experience" [...] and [...] "awe-inspiring".|$|R

25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{situation of}} the BP informal speech {{in relation to the}} standard language is controversial. There are authors (Bortoni, Kato, Mattos e Silva, Bagno, Perini) who <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a case of diglossia, considering that informal BP has developed– both in phonetics and grammar– in its own particular way.|$|E
25|$|Middle ear {{myoclonus}} {{occurs in}} {{the muscles of the}} middle ear. These muscles may include the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles.

5000|$|In {{half of the}} song, Kristoff {{sings the}} song as a duet between himself and [...] "Sven" [...] (with Sven's part merely being Kristoff using a goofy voice).

25|$|Paul's {{conversion}} {{experience is}} discussed in both the Pauline epistles and in the Acts of the Apostles.

25|$|In the Aeneid of Vergil, Nisus, a Trojan soldier, is in a {{relationship}} with Euryalus, a younger Trojan soldier. Although Vergil avoids directly describing the nature of their relationship due to the decorum of the epic poem, the nature of their relationship has been the source of academic discourse. While some believe the relationship to be platonic, others <b>describe</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> pederastic.|$|E
