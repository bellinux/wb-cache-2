5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae). Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> and birds-foot-trefoil.

25|$|The Breton forests, dunes, moorlands and marshes {{are home}} to several iconic plants, such as endemic cistus, aster and linaria varieties, the <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> and the lotus maritimus.|$|E
25|$|The site is of high entomological interest, with 29 {{varieties}} of resident breeding species of butterfly recorded. The <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> (Hippocrepis comosa) is locally plentiful and supports both the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and the Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) butterflies. Other butterfly species {{to be found}} on and around the site include for the Duke of Burgundy (Hamaeris lucina), the grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), the dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), and the small blue (Cupido minimus).|$|E
25|$|The SSSI {{designation}} for {{the site}} arises due to interest in the biodiversity and species present upon the earthworks of the fort themselves, with the inner and surrounding parts of the site being of improved agricultural grassland of little interest. The earthworks support a rich chalk grassland flora, including for several rare species. There are 16 species of grass and sedge recorded; with upright brome (Bromus erectus), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), quaking grass (Briza media), crested hair-grass (Koeleria cristata), and dwarf sedge (Carex humilis). Various herb species include for dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> (Hippocrepis comosa), common thyme (Thymus praecox), squinancywort (Asperula cynanchica) and common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium).|$|E
2500|$|The {{grassland}} {{is generally}} dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), red fescue (Festuca rubra), and upright brome (Bromus erectus). There are also several varieties of herbs, characteristic to the Wiltshire downland, including for devil's bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), and chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea). There are also many other native and site specific plants, including for orchids, meadow grasses, nettles, and other flora.

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the Adonis blue is calcareous grasslands with hot and dry conditions. This {{is because the}} larva feeds on <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> (Hippocrepis comosa) which is largely restricted to these habitats. This plant flourishes on sheep-grazed pastures and disappears {{after a few years}} when cattle graze. Sometimes human-created landforms provide refuges for the plant and the butterfly; an example of this is on Martin Down in Dorset, where <b>horseshoe</b> <b>vetch</b> only occurs on ancient earthworks with thin calcareous soils.|$|E

The caterpillar creates a shelter by spinning leaves together and feeds until fully grown in August. It then creates a larger tent {{to form a}} hibernaculum where it hibernates. Pupation occurs the following spring without further feeding. Adults are on the wing from mid-May till mid-June.|$|E
