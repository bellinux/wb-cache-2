50|$|Sinus surgery with {{balloons}} may {{be performed}} in a hospital, outpatient surgery setting or in the physician’s office under local anesthesia. The physician inserts a <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> through the nostril and near the sinus opening under endoscopic visualization. A flexible guide wire is then introduced into the targeted sinus to confirm access. Most guide wires have a light on the tip which may produce light transmission seen through the skin to help the physician with correct placement of the guide wire. Once access to a blocked sinus is confirmed, a balloon catheter is advanced over the guide wire and positioned in the blocked sinus opening for inflation. The balloon is inflated. If the procedure is successful, the sinus will remain open after the balloon is deflated and removed as the bone surrounding the sinus is permanently remodeled.|$|E

The system consists of several components: a <b>guide</b> <b>catheter,</b> a steerable navigation catheter, and planning and navigation software and hardware (i.e., computer and monitor). Navigation is facilitated by an electromagnetic tracking system that detects a position sensor incorporated into a flexible catheter advanced through a bronchoscope. Information obtained during bronchoscopy is super-imposed on previously acquired computed tomography (CT) data and 3-dimensional virtual images. The system was designed to solve the clinical problem of reaching small suspected lesions in the peripheral lung airways and mediastinal lymph nodes and is being proposed as an alternative to open surgical biopsy of distant lung lesions and as an alternative to transthoracic implantation of radiosurgical markers.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Treating a blocked ("stenosed") {{coronary}} artery with a stent follows the same steps as other angioplasty procedures {{with a few}} important differences. The interventional cardiologist uses angiography to assess the location and estimate {{the size of the}} blockage ("lesion") by injecting a contrast medium through the <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> and viewing the flow of blood through the downstream coronary arteries. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be used to assess the lesion's thickness and hardness ("calcification"). The cardiologist uses this information to decide whether to treat the lesion with a stent, and if so, what kind and size. Drug eluting stents are most often sold as a unit, with the stent in its collapsed form attached onto the outside of a balloon catheter. Outside the US, physicians may perform [...] "direct stenting" [...] where the stent is threaded through the lesion and expanded. Common practice in the US is to predilate the blockage before delivering the stent. Predilation is accomplished by threading the lesion with an ordinary balloon catheter and expanding it to the vessel's original diameter. The physician withdraws this catheter and threads the stent on its balloon catheter through the lesion. The physician expands the balloon which deforms the metal stent to its expanded size. The cardiologist may [...] "customize" [...] the fit of the stent to match the blood vessel's shape, using IVUS to guide the work. It is critically important that the framework of the stent be in direct contact with the walls of the vessel to minimize potential complications such as blood clot formation. Very long lesions may require more than one stent—this result of this treatment is sometimes referred to as a [...] "full metal jacket".|$|E
5000|$|In this {{single-stage}} procedure the urethra will be visualized (in {{the area}} of the defect), and the incision will be started at its mid-line (usually) using a bovie knife to dissect the dermal and sub-dermal layers until the associated musculature, corpus cavernosum, corpus spongiosum, and ventral urethral aspects are exposed. Particular care is used during the dissection to prevent damage to nerves and blood vessels (which could result in erectile dysfunction or loss of tactile sensation of the penis). The area of the defect is evaluated and marked both mid-line (laterally), and at the distal and proximal borders (transversely). Marked/labeled positioning sutures are secured (one, each) at the proximal and distal ends of the mid-line area of urethra closest to the bisection points. Using an index finger, the urethra is gently separated from the cavernosum, and a specially designed retractor is then placed behind the urethra (to protect vulnerable areas from damage during the transecting and removal of the urethral defect. The now patent ends of the urethra are prepared using a technique called [...] "spatulation", which (essentially) allows for the end-to-end anastomosis to adjust to the differing diameters of the urethra. A silicone catheter is inserted through the penis and (temporary) distal-urethral end, and threaded into the (temporary) proximal-urethral end, leaving a wide loop for the surgeon to have access to the dorsal urethral aspect for micro-suturing, and start of the anastomosis. The dorsal one-third of the urethral anastomosis is begun, completed, and the catheter is retracted slightly to allow for its positioning within the pre-anastomosed urethra. At this time, using micro surgical technique, the anastomosis is completed and fibrin glue is applied to the anastomotic suture line to help prevent leakage and fistula formation. The silicone <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> will then be withdrawn from the penis and (a) replaced by an appropriately sized Foley catheter (and urinary drainage system), and the incision closed (layer by layer). Some surgeons will inject a local anesthetic such as 2% plain lidocaine or 0.5% bupivicaine into the areas to allow the patient an additional period of relief from discomfort.|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy {{with the use of a}} stent retriever in acute ischemic stroke, performed by using a balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> or non-balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter.</b> Materials and Methods In accordance with the institutional review board approval obtained at the two participating institutions, retrospective analysis was performed in 183 consecutive patients treated between 2013 and 2014 for occlusions in the middle cerebral artery or carotid terminus by using a stent retriever with a balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> (n = 102) at one center and a non-balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> (n = 81) at the other center. Data on procedure duration, number of passes, angiographic findings, type of stent retriever used, and expertise of the operators were collected. Successful recanalization was defined as grade 3 or 2 b modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia recanalization accomplished in up to three passes. Univariate and multivariate subgroup analyses were conducted to control for the confounding variables of prior thrombolysis, location of occlusion, and operator expertise. Results Successful recanalization with the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> was achieved in 89. 2 % of thrombectomies (91 of 102) versus 67. 9 % (55 of 81) achieved with the non-balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> (P =. 0004).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} proximal flow control on efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in an in vitro middle cerebral artery occlusion. METHODS: Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter,</b> were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS: Use of the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the formation of large distal emboli with a diameter 3 ̆e 1 mm, regardless of the device used (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Applying aspiration via the balloon <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> {{in place of the}} conventional <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69. 2 +/- 27. 3 and 45. 5 +/- 22. 8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> was used (1. 5 versus 1. 1).

40|$|Ponangi Udaya Prashant CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, India Abstract: Appropriate <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> {{selection}} is a paramount requirement for successful angioplasty of complex coronary artery lesions. When choosing an appropriate <b>guide</b> <b>catheter,</b> the diameter {{and shape of}} the guide are the most important factors to be considered, and depend on the anatomy of the coronary artery and backup support required to cross the obstructive lesion. In turn, backup support of the <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> depends on the size and terminal shape of the guide rather than the route of intervention chosen and can be expressed mathematically. Many radial route-specific guide catheters have been developed by introducing extratertiary curves and angles to previous existing femoral guides. Backup support can be enhanced by various maneuvers and innovations like the “mother-child” technique. Computer-aided aortogram analysis can help in choosing the right catheter for anomalous coronary arteries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using a 6. 5 Fr sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> as a default system in transradial (TRA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: TRA PCI has been shown to reduce mortality rates through a reduction in access site related bleeding complications compared with procedures performed though a femoral approach. Complications associated with the TRA route increase with the size of sheath used. These complications may be reduced by the use of a sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> system (Asahi Intecc, Japan) that is 1 - 2 Fr sizes smaller in diameter than the corresponding introducer sheath. METHODS: We performed PCI in 100 consecutive cases using 6. 5 Fr sheathless guides to determine the procedural success, rates of symptomatic radial spasm and radial occlusion. RESULTS: Procedural success using the 6. 5 Fr sheathless <b>guide</b> <b>catheter</b> system was 100 % with no cases requiring conversion to a conventional guide and catheter system. There were no procedural complications recorded associated with the use of the catheter.

The sheathless <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> system that is in diameter 1 - 2 French (Fr) smaller than the corresponding introducer sheath may overcome these difficulties. Methods: From January 2010 through December 2010 in 5 Italian high-volume hospitals, 213 consecutive patients who underwent TRA-PCIs using the sheathless Eaucath <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> system because of small radial artery caliber (Group 1) or undergoing bifurcation PCIs (Group 2) were enrolled in this registry.

Results: Among the 213 patients enrolled, 270 vessels were treated for 316 lesions. No procedures required conversion to a conventional <b>guiding</b> <b>catheter</b> system. There were significantly more female patients in Group 1, and they were, older, shorter, and thinner than patients in Group 2. No cases of major vascular complications were observed in either groups.
