5|$|The {{first stage}} starts in pre-war Amiens, France. Stephen Wraysford visits and lives with René Azaire, his wife Isabelle and their children. Azaire teaches Stephen about the French textile industry. He {{witnesses}} a comfortable middle class life in Northern France alongside industrial worker unrest. Azaire and the significantly younger Isabelle express discontent with their marriage. This sparks Stephen's interest in Isabelle, {{with whom he}} soon falls in love. During one incident, Azaire, embarrassed that he and Isabelle cannot <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child,</b> beats her in a jealous rage. Around the same time, Isabelle helps give food {{to the families of}} striking workers, stirring rumours that she is having an affair with one of the workers.|$|E
5|$|When Susan's husband, Karl, is {{suspected}} of causing {{the death of a}} patient, he decides to move their family to Erinsborough for a fresh start. As Susan settles into Ramsay Street, she hopes to get back into teaching. Susan gets involved in the drama society and works at the Coffee Shop for Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies). Karl wants to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child,</b> but Susan is opposed to the idea. She later decides that she wants to return to teaching and is given a job at Erinsborough High. Susan chaperones Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) on a trip to South Africa and she confesses to him that she helped her mother to die. Susan invites Billy's best friend, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to move in and he becomes a surrogate son after Malcolm leaves. Susan is offered the position of principal at a school in Wangaratta and she accepts, knowing that she will have to leave her family. After a few months, Susan is offered the job of principal at Erinsborough High. While Susan is away, Karl kisses his receptionist, Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles).

It takes months before Susan forgives Karl, but they work on trying to save their marriage by attending counselling.

A few days later the request was granted. Letourneau and Fualaau were married on May 20, 2005, in the city of Woodinville, Washington, in a ceremony at the Columbia Winery. Exclusive access to the wedding was given to the television show Entertainment Tonight, and photographs were released through other media outlets.

500|$|Franklin and his brother, James, criticized {{smallpox}} inoculation, {{which was}} performed by drawing a string, previously {{in contact with the}} pustules of a smallpox victim, through a small incision on the person being inoculated. At the time, inoculation offered a mortality chance of 2%, while smallpox contracted naturally was fatal to 15% of the infected. Later, while James still opposed inoculation, Franklin came to support it, believing it was a [...] "safe and beneficial practice." [...] In 1736, however, Francis contracted smallpox and died on November 21 of that year, without having been inoculated. Both Franklin and Deborah were devastated, and their devastation was compounded because they were unsure they could <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child.</b> Ironically, Franklin had written his paper, [...] "On the Death of Infants", while Francis was still alive, and was inspired by his youngest son when writing about the beauty of babies.

One of her early sound film appearances was with her sister Helene in Warner Bros.'s all-star extravaganza, The Show of Shows (1929). Her acting career became less a priority for her following the birth of her first child, Dolores Ethel Mae [...] "DeeDee" [...] Barrymore (born April 8, 1930) and she retired from the screen in 1931 to devote time to her family.

Nandi and Shaka were initially accepted into Senzangakhona's kraal, and she was treated as a lesser wife. As she was not his Great Wife, Shaka was not the heir. Senzangakona was unwilling to acknowledge Nandi as his chief consort, an important status symbol among the amaZulu. He did <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child</b> with her, Shaka's sister Nomcoba. Mkabi, the Great Wife, did, however, treat Nandi well. Nevertheless, Nandi's relationship with Senzangakhona eventually deteriorated, so she and Shaka were forced to leave the kraal.|$|E
2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. [...] As a result, the couple must {{decide what to do with}} these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo’s humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child,</b> the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|E

Her family decide Michelle should have an abortion but she refuses, keeping the baby but keeping the father's name a secret. Vicki is born in 1986 and Den is allowed to hold her but he and Michelle agree that he should keep his distance so nobody guesses he is her father. Michelle raises Vicki with her fiance, Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), who she marries after jilting him at the altar, although Den provides for Vicki secretly. After Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff) realises that she has had a phantom pregnancy, she is devastated and suggests to Michelle that she lets her and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih) adopt Vicki.

40|$|The present paper studies {{fertility}} rates in partnerships {{with and without}} children from previous partners in East and West Germany. Data from the German "Fertility and Family Survey" is used to estimate piecewise-linear hazard rate models for <b>having</b> <b>another</b> <b>child.</b> It turns out that a proportional-hazard model would give incorrect results because childbirth follows different time patterns for couples who have already a shared child and couples who do not. Therefore, a model with specific clocks for various experiences of parenthood is specified. Based on these model estimations the probability for <b>having</b> <b>another</b> <b>child</b> within a certain time is calculated. In West Germany the estimated likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>another</b> <b>child</b> within six years varies little by child composition. In contrast, East-German couples with no shared child have a higher likelihood than couples with a shared child {{to have a child}} within six years. fertility, hazard rate model, proportionality assumption, stepfamily...|$|R

60|$|In this dismal but splendid museum, I remarked {{two little}} tombs with little red fezzes, very small, and for very young heads evidently, which were lying under the little {{embroidered}} palls of state. I forget {{whether they had}} candles too; but their little flame of life was soon extinguished, {{and there was no}} need of many pounds of wax to typify it. These were the tombs of Mahmoud's grandsons, nephews of the present Light of the Universe, and children of his sister, the wife of Halil Pasha. Little children die in all ways: these of the much-maligned Mahometan Royal race perished by the bowstring. Sultan Mahmoud (may he rest in glory!) strangled the one; but, having some spark of human feeling, was so moved by the wretchedness and agony of the poor bereaved mother, his daughter, that his Royal heart relented towards her, and he promised that, should she ever <b>have</b> <b>another</b> <b>child,</b> it should be allowed to live. He died; and Abdul Medjid (may his name be blessed!), the debauched young man whom we just saw riding to the mosque, succeeded. His sister, whom he is said to have loved, became again a mother, and had a son. But she relied upon her father's word and her august brother's love, and hoped that this little one should be spared. The same accursed hand tore this infant out of its mother's bosom, and killed it. The poor woman's heart broke outright at this second calamity, and she died. But on her death-bed she sent for her brother, rebuked him as a perjurer and an assassin, and expired calling down the divine justice on his head.
