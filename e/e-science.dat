25|$|The Enabling Grids for <b>E-sciencE</b> project, {{based in}} the European Union and {{included}} sites in Asia and the United States, was a follow-up project to the European DataGrid (EDG) and evolved into the European Grid Infrastructure. This, along with the LHC Computing Grid (LCG), was developed to support experiments using the CERN Large Hadron Collider. A list of active sites participating within LCG can be found online as can real time monitoring of the EGEE infrastructure. The relevant software and documentation is also publicly accessible. There is speculation that dedicated fiber optic links, such as those installed by CERN to address the LCG's data-intensive needs, may one day be available to home users thereby providing internet services at speeds up to 10,000 times faster than a traditional broadband connection. The European Grid Infrastructure has been also used for other research activities and experiments such as the simulation of oncological clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|The King's Buildings (KB) {{is located}} further {{south of the}} city. Most of the Science and Engineering College's {{research}} and teaching activities {{take place at the}} King's Buildings, which occupy a 35 hectare site. It includes C. H. Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and the School of Mathematics), The Royal Observatory, William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment) and other schools' buildings. There were three libraries at KB: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. A new library called The Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the 2012/13 session as a replacement for the previous three libraries. It also houses National <b>e-Science</b> Centre (NeSC), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC), and the Scottish Institute for Enterprise.|$|E

[...] It is a partner of the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, has erected robotic telescopes in Tenerife and the Antarctic, develops astronomical instrumentation for large telescopes such as the VLT of the ESO.

5000|$|Cyberinfrastructure is {{more often}} called <b>e-Science</b> or e-Research. [...] In particular, the United Kingdom started an <b>e-Science</b> {{initiative}} in 2001.; the Systems Geology initiative of the British Geological Survey is an example.Others distinguish <b>e-Science</b> as the work that is done using the cyberinfrastructure.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{research}} activities into <b>e-Science</b> {{have focused on the}} development of new computational tools and infrastructures to support scientific discovery. Due to the complexity of the software and the backend infrastructural requirements, <b>e-Science</b> projects usually involve large teams managed and developed by research laboratories, large universities or governments. Currently there is a large focus in <b>e-Science</b> in the United Kingdom, where the UK <b>e-Science</b> programme provides significant funding. In Europe the development of computing capabilities to support the CERN Large Hadron Collider has {{led to the development of}} <b>e-Science</b> and Grid infrastructures which are also used by other disciplines.|$|E
50|$|He {{founded the}} <b>e-Science</b> Institute in August 2001, {{as a central}} focus for the <b>e-Science</b> {{community}} in the UK. Its mission was to stimulate {{the creation of new}} insights in <b>e-Science</b> and computing science by bringing together international experts and enabling them to successfully address significant and diverse challenges.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) <b>e-Science</b> {{task force}} issued its report on <b>e-Science</b> and librarianship. The ARL's report {{encouraged}} its member libraries to position themselves {{to engage with}} researchers involved in <b>e-Science</b> (eScience) by cultivating new research support strategies and developing their digital scholarship infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>E-Science</b> has {{multiple}} attributes; Tony and Jessie Hey framed <b>e-Science</b> {{for the library}} community by characterizing it as a research methodology: [...] "e-Science {{is not a new}} scientific discipline in its own right: <b>e-Science</b> is shorthand for the set of tools and technologies required to support collaborative, networked science".|$|E
50|$|A {{call for}} {{applications}} {{for the role of}} <b>e-Science</b> Senior Research Fellow for the <b>e-Science</b> Core Programme was issued by the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in 2005. Malcolm Atkinson was the successful candidate and started his work as the <b>e-Science</b> Envoy on 1 April 2006 under EPSRC Grant No EP/D079829/1. Consequently, he stepped down {{as the director of the}} UK National <b>e-Science</b> Centre. The director post was taken up by Prof. Peter Clarke who held it until August 2009.|$|E
50|$|The Centre was {{a founder}} {{member of the}} UK’s National <b>e-Science</b> Centre (NeSC), the hub of Grid and <b>e-Science</b> {{activity}} in the UK. EPCC and NeSC were both partners in OMII-UK, which offers consultancy and products to the UK <b>e-Science</b> community.

5000|$|In 2009 the Lamar Soutter Library at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, New England Region (NN/LM NER) funded an <b>e-Science</b> {{program for}} {{building}} the skills highlighted above for librarians. Elaine Russo Martin, Director of Library Services at the Lamar Soutter Library and Director of the NN/LM NER developed this comprehensive <b>e-Science</b> program to build librarians' subject {{expertise in the}} sciences, developing their data management skills, and their familiarity with cyberinfrastructure and <b>e-Science.</b> Three major products of this program are the <b>e-Science</b> web portal for librarians, the <b>E-Science</b> Symposium, and the New England Collaborative Data Management Curriculum (NECDMC). [...] This portal includes educational resources for specific tools and subject/discipline tutorials and modules to assist librarians new to <b>e-Science.</b> It is available at: http://esciencelibrary.umassmed.edu/escience. UMMS and NN/LM NER also publish an open access journal called the Journal of eScience Librarianship.|$|E
5000|$|<b>E-science</b> tends toward inter- and {{multidisciplinary}} {{approaches that}} depend on computation and computer science. Research libraries have traditionally been discipline focused and, although increasingly technologically sophisticated, do not have systems of the scale or complexity of the <b>e-science</b> environment. <b>E-science</b> is data intensive, but research libraries have not typically been responsible for scientific data. <b>E-science</b> is frequently conducted in a team context, often distributed across multiple institutions and on a global scale. The primary constituency of libraries generally comprises those affiliated with the local institution. Licenses for electronic content are typically restricted to a particular institutional community, and the infrastructure to move institutional licenses into a multi-institutional environment is not well developed. <b>E-science</b> challenges all these traditional paradigms of research library organization and services. -Neil Rambo ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to academic libraries' interests in providing {{support for their}} researchers engaging in <b>e-Science,</b> the health sciences library community also emerged as a major proponent for creating librarian positions for supporting the information needs of large-scale, networked, research collaborations on their campuses.
