2500|$|If {{the umpire}} makes an {{incorrect}} signal, he may revoke it. [...] To do so, he crosses <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, then makes the corrected signal. A revocation {{may be made}} if the umpire discovers an incorrect application of the laws, such as, signalling [...] "out" [...] before realising that the other umpire signalled a no-ball. Also, an umpire may revoke if he accidentally signals a four though he intended to signal six. See [...] With {{the implementation of the}} Decision Review System, a signal may also be revoked if the Third Umpire reports that his review supports reversing the call.|$|E
60|$|He got up, shook himself, {{and slapped}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast vigorously.|$|E
60|$|Here {{he put his}} wet {{fingers in}} his mouth, blowing on them afterward, and smacking <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast to restore the circulation.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear lord," [...] Surajah said, as {{he knelt}} {{beside him and}} laid <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, [...] "you frighten me. Has aught gone wrong? Are you ill?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dan said nothing, but laid <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> {{face and}} lay quite still. Seeing that the pathetic little message had done its work {{even better than}} he hoped, the {{chaplain}} went on, unconscious how soothing his paternal voice was to the poor prisoner who longed to 'go home', but felt he had forfeited the right.|$|R
60|$|Mr Snawley looked steadfastly {{at his son}} for a full minute, {{and then}} {{covering}} his eyes with his hand, and once more raising his hat in the air, appeared deeply occupied in deploring his black ingratitude. Then drawing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> eyes, he picked up Mr Squeers's hat, and taking it under one <b>arm,</b> and <b>his</b> own under the other, walked slowly and sadly out.|$|R
60|$|In {{his room}} Lieut. Feraud {{unhooked}} the clasp, flung his new dolman on the bed, and, folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, {{turned to the}} other hussar.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Moore {{leaned back}} in his chair and folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. Miss Keeldar resumed her square of silk canvas, and {{continued}} the creation of a wreath of Parmese violets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{there are}} three of us," [...] went on the Man. [...] "The {{stranger}} from the East has found defenders from the West. On, defenders, for I do not fight thus," [...] and he folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> broad breast and smiled with the awful eyes.|$|E
60|$|But Beniah stood speechless, {{a strange}} {{expression}} on his face, his lips firmly compressed and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough Mr. Archer’s pallor and {{agitation}} {{had continued}} to increase; his cheeks were deathly, his clenched fingers trembled pitifully. ‘The weakness is physical,’ he sighed, and had nearly fallen. Nance led him from the spot, and he was no sooner back in the tower-stair, than he fell heavily {{against the wall and}} put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> eyes. A cup of brandy had to be brought him before he could descend to breakfast; and the perfection of Nance’s dream was for the first time troubled.|$|R
60|$|He leant with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> the table, <b>his</b> eyes {{glittering}} with excitement.|$|R
60|$|It was nipping cold, and, {{even with}} the window tightly closed and nailed over with slats, Sam could not endure it {{to remain on the}} bench long. Leaping up he began to stamp his feet and slap <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest to get them warm. Soon he heard Tubbs doing the same thing.|$|E
60|$|Vitality {{was strong}} in the sailor. It needed only a few seconds' working of the human machine to call it into full play. He {{squeezed}} {{the water out of}} his jacket and trousers, and then slapped <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest with extreme violence, stamping his feet the while, so that he was speedily in a sufficiently restored condition to devote his attention with effect to the child, which still lay motionless on the grass.|$|E
60|$|The {{watchman}} made {{no reply}} to the greeting, but, breathing heavily, resumed his old seat on the post; and, folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> panting bosom, looked down with majestic scorn upon the schooner and all its contents. Long after the satisfied mate had forgotten the incident in sleep, he sat there striving to digest the insult {{of which he had}} been the victim, and to consider a painful and fitting retribution.|$|E
6000|$|Sure enough Mr. Archer's pallor and {{agitation}} {{had continued}} to increase; his cheeks were deathly, his clenched fingers trembled pitifully.

60|$|Dale {{saw that}} {{beautiful}} hand slowly creep up <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, and slide round {{his neck to}} clasp there. He was powerless to inhibit the picture. And what he felt then was boundless, unutterable. No woman had ever yet so much as clasped his hand, and heretofore no such imaginings had ever crossed his mind, yet deep in him, somewhere hidden, had been this waiting, sweet, and imperious need. In the bright day he appeared to ward off such fancies, but at night he was helpless. And every fancy left him weaker, wilder.|$|R
60|$|Rising {{and going}} quietly out, he beat <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> vigorously <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest until {{circulation}} was fully restored. Then he mounted a neighbouring ice-ledge, and saw {{at a glance}} that their case had become desperate.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, Cap, who had {{announced}} his approach {{by a couple}} of lusty hems, now made his appearance on the bastion, where, after nodding to his niece and her companion, he made a deliberate survey of the expanse of water before him. In order to effect this at his ease, the mariner mounted on one of the old iron guns, folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast, and balanced his body, as if he felt the motion of a vessel. To complete the picture, he had a short pipe in his mouth.|$|E
60|$|After {{delivering}} {{himself of}} all this and much more as if preaching a sermon, he was assisted from his horse and led by the hand to the front door, after which the boy drew back and folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast stared haughtily at us children and the others who had congregated at the spot. Evidently {{he was proud of}} his position as page or squire or groom of the important person in the tall straw hat, red cloak, and iron spurs, who galloped about the land collecting tribute from the people and talking loftily about the Powers above.|$|E
60|$|In {{accordance}} {{with the fact that}} squaring the elbows and clenching the fists are gestures by no means universal with the men of all races, when they feel indignant and are prepared to attack their enemy, so it appears that a helpless or apologetic frame of mind is expressed {{in many parts of the}} world by merely shrugging the shoulders, without turning inwards the elbows and opening the hands. The man or child who is obstinate, or one who is resigned to some great misfortune, has in neither case any idea of resistance by active means; and he expresses this state of mind, by simply keeping his shoulders raised; or he may possibly fold <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|E
60|$|An old-looking man spoke. He {{lay with}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast, {{addressing}} apparently the smoky rafters. He was a Russian, {{a teacher of}} languages in Paris at {{the outbreak of the}} war, and had joined the French Army.|$|R
60|$|The mucker {{caught the}} girl in <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> {{throwing}} her <b>across</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. The blood from his wounds smeared her hands and clothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would he mind if I {{woke him}} up? I want {{very much to}} talk to him." [...] Harris peered inside. He could see a neat room, with a desk, a rug and lamp, and two bunks. On one of the bunks was Westerburg, lying face up, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, his eyes tightly closed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather think," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "it must {{be because}} they have too strong a faculty of criticism. You can't teach {{a man to be}} proud of his own work; that lies in his blood [...] "; folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast, he heaved a sigh. Under the dark foliage, his eyes on the sunlight, he was the type of all those Englishmen who keep their spirits bright and wear their bodies out in the dark places of hard work. [...] "You can't think," [...] he said, showing his teeth in a smile, [...] "how {{delightful}} it is to be at home! You learn to love the old country when you're away from it." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{waiting to}} be served I {{mentioned}} that, born from parents settled in St. Petersburg, I had acquired the language as a child. The town I did not remember, having left it for good as a boy of nine, but in later years I had renewed my acquaintance with the language. He listened, without as much as moving his eyes the least little bit. He had to change his position when the beer came, and the instant draining of his glass revived him. He {{leaned back in his}} chair and, folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, continued to stare at me squarely. It occurred to me that his clean-shaven, almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile sort, and that the absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of a revolutionist, of a conspirator everlastingly on his guard against self-betrayal in a world of secret spies.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I said my {{wife was}} mad," [...] he began, suddenly, causing d'Alcacer to start, [...] "I didn't mean it literally, of course." [...] His tone sounded {{slightly}} dogmatic and he didn't seem {{to be aware of}} any interval during which he had appeared to sleep. D'Alcacer was convinced more than ever that he had been shamming, and resigned himself wearily to listen, folding <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. [...] "What I meant, really," [...] continued Mr. Travers, [...] "was that she is the victim of a craze. Society is subject to crazes, as you know very well. They are not reprehensible in themselves, but the worst of my wife is that her crazes are never like those of the people with whom she naturally associates. They generally run counter to them. This peculiarity has given me some anxiety, you understand, in the position we occupy. People will begin to say that she is eccentric. Do you see her anywhere, d'Alcacer?" ...|$|E
60|$|Armand {{had said}} nothing during this time. While Blakeney was {{unfolding}} {{his plan for}} him and for Lord Hastings--a plan which practically was a command--he had sat with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, his head sunk upon his breast. When Blakeney had asked if they were satisfied, he had taken no part in Hastings' protest nor responded to his leader's good-humoured banter.|$|R
40|$|Black {{and white}} lantern slide of Fr. Frederick Dietz, MM, {{talking to a}} child at a clinic. Fr. Deitz stands {{outdoors}} with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. He wears a white cassock. The child sits with his knees pulled up to his chest on the grass {{in front of a}} building with a terra cotta roof. With <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> folded, he looks up at Fr. Dietz...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{then walked}} along {{back into the}} yard, and {{began to think of}} the subject of the sun's shining in at the south door. He looked up towards the sun, and began to {{consider}} what sort of a change in its place, at noon, on different days, would be necessary in order to account for its shining in more at south doors and windows, on some days, than on others. He reflected that if the sun were exactly overhead, at noon, it could not shine in at any doors at all; for the rays would then strike perpendicularly down the sides of the houses. While he was standing thus, lost in thought, looking up to the sun, with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> forehead, to shelter his eyes a little from the dazzling rays, he suddenly felt the pressure of two soft hands upon his ears, as of somebody who had come up behind him. He turned round, and found his cousin Lucy standing there.|$|R
60|$|He {{would go}} to her now. She would tell him what to do; and after dinner, when the dear lady was {{thinking}} of early bedtime, he might slip away with Isabel Doan's check. He must return it in person. He shifted {{from one foot to}} the other and beat <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast. The charge of the blizzard was paralyzing. Down the way a car was coming--a red one, he was sure of it--glad of it. His mother would be waiting for him. For the time he forgot a parallel track and that other destination directly west. Suddenly like songs of sirens, he heard the buzz of opposing trolleys. Two cars would meet before his eyes! But the red one still led. Yet how strange: it had just stopped. The yellow opponent came on. The priest breathed hard. Fate seemed to be thrashing his will with the storm. Again the red car moved and the yellow one halted. Chance was playing a game. He leaned expectant from the curb. Something had gone wrong, for once more the red line had lost the trolley, then an instant later a yellow car stood on the crossing. Father Barry sprang over the tracks, veered around to an open side, jumped aboard.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few weeks}} later {{a part of our}} army made an assault upon the enemy's left. The attack, which was made upon an unknown {{position}} and across unfamiliar ground, was led by our brigade. The ground was so broken and the underbrush so thick that all mounted officers and men were compelled to fight on foot--the brigade commander and his staff included. In the mêlée Thurston was parted from the rest of us, and we found him, horribly wounded, only when we had taken the enemy's last defense. He was some months in hospital at Nashville, Tennessee, but finally rejoined us. He said little about his misadventure, except that he had been bewildered and had strayed into the enemy's lines and been shot down; but from one of his captors, whom we in turn had captured, we learned the particulars. [...] "He came walking right upon us as we lay in line," [...] said this man. [...] "A whole company of us instantly sprang up and leveled our rifles at his breast, some of them almost touching him. 'Throw down that sword and surrender, you damned Yank!' shouted some one in authority. The fellow ran his eyes along the line of rifle barrels, folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast, his right hand still clutching his sword, and deliberately replied, 'I will not.' If we had all fired he would have been torn to shreds. Some of us didn't. I didn't, for one; nothing could have induced me." ...|$|E
60|$|A slight {{observer}} {{would speak}} of the old man's quietude; but, on closer scrutiny, you discover {{that there is a}} continual unrest within him, which somewhat resembles the fluttering action of the nerves in a corpse from which life has recently departed. Though he never exhibits any violent action, and, indeed, might appear to be sitting quite still, yet you perceive, when his minuter peculiarities begin to be detected, that he is always making some little movement or other. He looks anxiously at his plate of cakes or pyramid of apples and slightly alters their arrangement, with an evident idea that a great deal depends on their being disposed exactly thus and so. Then for a moment he gazes out of the window; then he shivers quietly and folds <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> breast, as if to draw himself closer within himself, and thus keep a flicker of warmth in his lonesome heart. Now he turns again to his merchandise of cakes, apples, and candy, and discovers that this cake or that apple, or yonder stick of red and white candy, has somehow got out of its proper position. And is there not a walnut-kernel too many or too few in one of those small tin measures? Again the whole arrangement appears to be settled to his mind; but, {{in the course of a}} minute or two, there will assuredly be something to set right. At times, by an indescribable shadow upon his features, too quiet, however, to be noticed until you are familiar with his ordinary aspect, the expression of frostbitten, patient despondency becomes very touching. It seems as if just at that instant the suspicion occurred to him that, in his chill decline of life, earning scanty bread by selling cakes, apples, and candy, he is a very miserable old fellow.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of {{the manager of the}} Los Angeles Angels, Bill Rigney, ca. 1961. Bill poses with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> crossed <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest as he is pictured with {{a smile on his face}} from the chest up. He wear a lightly colored baseball uniform with the words "Los Angeles" written across the front of the jersey and a darkly colored baseball cap with the letters "LA" stitched onto it...|$|R
2500|$|Born in Manchester, {{the son of}} a prostitute, Lee {{was brought}} up in children's homes and {{suffered}} from epilepsy and congenital spastic hemiplegia in his right limbs, which left him with a limp in his right leg and a compulsion to hold <b>his</b> right <b>arm</b> <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. [...] As an adult, he worked as a labourer and was known locally as [...] "daft Peter". In 1979, his mother remarried. His stepfather's surname was Lee, and Dinsdale changed his name as an homage to Bruce Lee.|$|R
6000|$|Maynard {{brought his}} field-glasses {{to bear on}} the desperado. [...] "He has dismounted," [...] he said. [...] "He is squatted beside his horse, the bridle-rein on <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> a rifle <b>across</b> <b>his</b> knees, and is faced this way. His {{attitude}} is resolute and 'sassy.'" ...|$|R
