Prominent {{among them is the}} mantapa within which Kuvempu's marriage was solemnised. Next to the Mantapa is the laminated Lagnapatrike, the invitation card used for inviting guests to Kuvempu's marriage. Large wooden boxes used for storing rice and other grains can also be seen in the main hall. Next to the hall, is the Baananti Kone, which is a room dedicated for caretaking of mothers who have just given birth to a child. A wooden Tottilu (cradle) used for putting the baby to sleep is a rare item present there. The kitchen is a revelation in itself and consists of utensils and other articles hardly seen in kitchens today. Some of the items include a big kadigolu, a ladle like utensil used for churning curd into buttermilk, a sarigolu which is a steam pot used for making idlis and a sambar marriage which is a box containing various compartments used to hold items that make a sambar. An interesting innovation in the kitchen is that of a Hoge Atta, which is an opening in the roof used to let out smoke generated by firewood in the kitchen. The Hoge Atta is made of wood with openings to let out smoke. Since Malnad region is a <b>high</b> <b>moisture</b> <b>area,</b> there are good chances that perishable food items will not stay for long. These items are placed on the Hoge Atta so that the smoke can prevent moisture from destroying these items. Another room contains a lot of photographs taken of Kuvempu's childhood and also of important events in his lifetime. A small room serves a shop where one can purchase books authored by Kuvempu and cassettes and CDs based on his work. A 10% discount is provided over the actual price of the items purchased here.|$|E

Unlike river rock, which is non-porous and highly explosive when heated, fire rock is considered a porous substance that is capable of releasing heat through tiny holes in its outer layer.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relative}} influence of biotic and abiotic factors on community dynamics using an integrated approach and highlights {{the influence of}} space on genotypic and phenotypic traits in plant community structure. We examined the relative influence of topography, environment, spatial distance, and intra- and interspecific interactions on spatial distribution and performance of Boechera stricta (rockcress), a close perennial relative of model plant Arabidopsis. First, using Bayesian kriging, we mapped the topography and environmental gradients and explored the spatial distribution of naturally occurring rockcress plants and two neighbors, Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) and Solidago missouriensis (goldenrod) found in close proximity within a typical diverse meadow community across topographic and environmental gradients. We then evaluated direct and indirect relationships among variables using Mantel path analysis and developed a network displaying abiotic and biotic interactions in this community. We found significant spatial autocorrelation among rockcress individuals, either because of common microhabitats as displayed by high density of individuals at lower elevation and <b>high</b> soil <b>moisture</b> <b>area,</b> or limited dispersal as shown by significant spatial autocorrelation of naturally occurring inbred lines, {{or a combination of}} both. Goldenrod and dandelion density around rockcress does not show any direct relationship with rockcress fecundity, possibly due to spatial segregation of resources. However, dandelion density around rockcress shows an indirect negative influence on rockcress fecundity via herbivory, indicating interspecific competition. Overall, we suggest that common microhabitat preference and limited dispersal are the main drivers for spatial distribution. However, intra-specific interactions and insect herbivory are the main drivers of rockcress performance in the meadow community...|$|R

This study investigates {{the effect on}} the incidence of brown centres in raw kernel after maintaining <b>high</b> <b>moisture</b> content in macadamia nuts-in-shell stored at temperatures of 30 °C, 35 °C, 40 °C and 45 °C. RESULTS: Brown centres of raw kernel increased with nuts-in-shell storage time and temperature when <b>high</b> <b>moisture</b> content was maintained by sealing in polyethylene bags. Almost all kernels developed the defect when kept at <b>high</b> <b>moisture</b> content for 5 days at 45 °C, and 44 % developed brown centres after only 2 days of storage at <b>high</b> <b>moisture</b> content at 45 °C. This contrasted with only 0. 76 % when stored for 2 days at 45 °C but allowed to dry in open-mesh bags.
