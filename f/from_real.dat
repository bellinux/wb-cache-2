In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's.

5|$|Original Stories <b>from</b> <b>Real</b> Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness is {{the only}} {{complete}} work of children's literature by the 18th-century English feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft.

The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn <b>from</b> <b>real</b> examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E

During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint.

A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request {{to return to the}} Church.

5|$|By 2008, {{the club}} was in a financially {{precarious}} position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club a year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, {{the club was}} purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho <b>from</b> <b>Real</b> Madrid for £32.5million. Performances were not a huge improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on {{a place in the}} Champions League, and competed in the UEFA Europa League in season 2010–11.|$|E
