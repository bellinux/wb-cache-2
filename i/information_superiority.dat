Celebrities qualify well for gossip since information about them is easy to find and share. The more popular a celebrity is, the easier gossip circulation becomes which then fuels further popularity and creates a self-energizing bandwagon effect.

40|$|Current {{measures}} of global gene expression analyses, such as correlation and mutual information-based approaches, largely {{depend on the}} degree of association between mRNA levels {{and to a lesser extent}} on variability. I develop and implement a new approach, called the Ratiometric method, which is based on the coefficient of variation of the expression ratio of two genes, relying more on variation than previous methods. The advantage of such modus operandi is the ability to detect possible gene pair interactions regardless of the degree of expression dispersion across the sample group. Gene pairs with low expression dispersion, i. e., their absolute expressions remain constant across the sample group, are systematically missed by correlation and mutual <b>information</b> analyses. The <b>superiority</b> of the Ratiometric method in finding these gene pair interactions is demonstrated in a data set of RNA-seq B-cell samples from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium.

40|$|In many sensory systems, {{the neural}} signal splits into {{multiple}} parallel pathways. For example, in the mammalian retina, ∼ 20 types of retinal ganglion cells transmit {{information about the}} visual scene to the brain. The purpose of this profuse and early pathway splitting remains unknown. We examine a common instance of splitting into ON and OFF neurons excited by increments and decrements of light intensity in the visual scene, respectively. We test the hypothesis that pathway splitting enables more efficient encoding of sensory stimuli. Specifically, we compare a model system with an ON and an OFF neuron to one with two ON neurons. Surprisingly, the optimal ON–OFF system transmits the same information as the optimal ON–ON system, if one constrains the maximal firing rate of the neurons. However, the ON–OFF system uses fewer spikes on average to transmit this <b>information.</b> This <b>superiority</b> of the ON–OFF system is also observed when the two systems are optimized while constraining their mean firing rate. The efficiency gain for the ON–OFF split is comparable with that derived from decorrelation, a well known processing strategy of early sensory systems. The gain can be orders of magnitude larger when the ecologically important stimuli are rare but large events of either polarity. The ON–OFF system also provides a better code for extracting information by a linear downstream decoder. The {{results suggest that the}} evolution of ON–OFF diversification in sensory systems may be driven by the benefits of lowering average metabolic cost, especially {{in a world in which}} the relevant stimuli are sparse...|$|R
40|$|Experts appear able {{to handle}} much larger amounts of {{specialized}} information than nonexperts, and handle it without an apparent superior memory capacity. This finding, based on research on chess players with chess information, was replicated on Go players with Go <b>information.</b> Assuming this <b>superiority</b> occurs because the experts process chunks of information through their limited capac-ities rather than individual elements, the question then becomes one of de-fining what the chunks are {{and how they are}} related. To this end, the technique of partitioning recall and reproduction data into chunks on the basis of inter-response times (IRTs) (introduced in their work on chess by Chase and Simon, 1973) was applied to the reproduction and recall of Go patterns by a Go Master and a Go beginner. Unlike its application in chess, no single IRT was able to produce consistent, veridical chunks for either Go player. Sub-sequent analysis of the underlying assumptions of the technique showed it to be limited to only those patterns that can be partitioned into a linear set of chunks, not nested chunks, and to situations in which retrieval and over...|$|R

Three theories were evaluated: Ericsson and Kintsch’s (Psychol Rev 102 : 211 – 245, 1995) theory of long-term working memory, Haider and Frensch’s (J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cognit 25 : 172 – 190, 1999) information-reduction hypothesis, and the holistic model of image perception of Kundel et al. (Radiology 242 : 396 – 402, 2007). Eye movement and performance data were cumulated from 819 experts, 187 intermediates, and 893 novices. In support of the evaluated theories, experts, when compared with non-experts, had shorter fixation durations, more fixations on task-relevant areas, and fewer fixations on task-redundant areas; experts also had longer saccades and shorter times to first fixate relevant <b>information,</b> owing to <b>superiority</b> in parafoveal processing and selective attention allocation.

Where the focus in the past has been on traditional organization resources such as land, labor, and capital, today knowledge is being recognized as the most strategically significant organization resource (Drucker 1993). The focus on knowledge and knowledge processes has led to the concept and practice of knowledge management (KM). Definitions for KM abound, but what is necessary to understand is that the general purpose of KM is to enhance organizational performance by explicitly designing and implementing tools, processes, systems, structures, and cultures to improve the creation, sharing, and use of 8 ̆ 5 knowledge that [is] critical for decision-making (Delong and Fahey 2000, para 14).
