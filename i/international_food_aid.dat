25|$|Debate {{over the}} {{specific}} cause or {{causes of the}} Bengali famine hinges {{on a series of}} interlinked questions: when the nature and scope of the disaster were recognized, whether enough food was available at the provincial or national level (or via <b>international</b> <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> arranged by Great Britain) to feed the population of Bengal, and whether the failure of the colonial rulers to alleviate the crisis was due to incompetence or insensitivity to Bengal's needs. The relative impact of each of these factors as a cause or contributing factor to the levels of death and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. In addition to the complexity of the issues and the questionable accuracy of much of the statistical data that could resolve the debates, a potentially complicating factor is that the conclusions are highly politicised, which may tend to predispose the content and tone of the conclusions reached.|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia has {{experienced}} {{more than five}} major droughts {{in the past three}} decades, leading to high dependency on <b>international</b> <b>food</b> <b>aids.</b> Nevertheless, studies indicate that asset depletion has not been prevented; neither did food insecurity diminish. Since 2004 / 5, the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) has been implemented to improve food security in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Critics point out that the implementation of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> programmes can have negative impacts as well as positive outcomes for local communities. Accordingly, this survey study aimed to analyse the distribution and allocation of <b>food</b> <b>aids</b> in the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Tigray. Results of 479 interviews revealed that targeting different households in the PSNP has been considerably linked to socio-demographic attributes among which age and size of family were decisive factors to receive <b>food</b> <b>aids.</b> Furthermore, older households with smaller family size received more direct support. Inequality between genders was another major finding of this study. When combined with the marital status, there was also a big difference in the percentage of married or unmarried women receiving <b>food</b> <b>aids.</b> These findings could provide fundamental information for policy intervention to correct food security programmes at household level and reduce hunger. Given that, socio-demographic factors can help to identify particular and usually different requirements, vulnerabilities and coping strategies {{of the members of the}} <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> programme, so that they can be much more addressed when an emergency happens...|$|R

This essay argues that humanitarian <b>aid,</b> and especially <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> is not a substitute for political action, but that it has become the main channel of the US’s Sudan policy for the past ten years. Torn between its conflicting economic, political, geo-strategic, and moral imperatives, the US has had to adopt a difficult strategy: supporting the rebels, but not openly, and not enough to enable them to win the war. In this situation, humanitarian aid, with its reputation of neutrality and its moral appeal concealing a fundamental vulnerability to all sorts of manipulation, is a very efficient tool. <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> is especially useful: it directly counteracts Khartoum’s strategy (starving the South into submission) and directly helps the rebel movement and army in a number of ways (bringing them resources, as well as domestic and <b>international</b> legitimacy). <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> also has the crucial advantage of fitting perfectly into western prejudices about Africa – a starving continent dependent on the West – so that no one thinks about questioning the underlying motives of US relief aid to Sudan...|$|R
40|$|A {{model in}} which policy makers {{maximize}} a weighted welfare function of producer, consumer, and taxpayer groups is applied to explain the effects of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> receipts on <b>food</b> policies in the countries receiving <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> Consumer subsidies for wheat in nine countries receiving <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> are examined during the 1955 - 83 period. Econometric results indicate <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> increases domestic <b>food</b> subsidies in the recipient countries, but that other factors (development, country-specific factors) are more important in determining subsidy level. Key words: consumer subsidy, <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> welfare function, wheat. <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> has long been controversial for its po-tential to depress prices and act as a disincen-ti ve to agricultural production in recipient countries (Schultz, Fisher, Seevers). The impact of <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> principally wheat, on internal pric-ing policies is at {{the crux of the}} debate. Critics claim that by augmenting food supplies and providing cheap food for the cities, <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> al-lows governments to maintain low price sup-ports for farmers, neglect in vestment in agriculture, and become increasingly dependent on imported food (Maxwell and Singer). The strength of these relationships has been exam-ined in considerable detail for production policy. Effects of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> on consumption policy have received little empirical attention (Byerlee and Sain, p. 962), although the de-scriptive literature has increasingly suggested the likely importance of effects on consumption policy (Byerlee, Stevens).

40|$|Magister Artium - MAThe food {{security}} crisis which gripped the sub Sahara Africa after the drought in 1999 / 2000 threatened development initiatives in these countries.

40|$|ReportThe global {{food crisis}} of 2007 - 08 was {{characterized}} by {{a dramatic increase in}} the prices of agricultural commodities in international markets. Between January 2007 and March 2008, the food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) rose 61 %. Staple food crop prices rose even more steeply: over the same period, the prices of wheat and rice doubled, while that of maize increased by 42 %. Since then, food prices have declined somewhat, but prices remain significantly higher than the average in 2006. For example, the average price of rice in 2009 is 90 % higher than the average level in 2006 (FAO, 2009). High world prices were transmitted to domestic markets, eroding the purchasing power of urban households and other net buyers of food, forcing them to reduce non-food spending and shift to cheaper foods. Poor urban households were particularly affected because they spend a large share of their income on food. At the national level, food importing countries faced balance of payment pressure as the cost of food imports rose. In addition, the cost of operating food and nutrition programs at the national and international level rose steeply. In dozens of countries, the high prices sparked demonstrations and sometimes riots. A number of countries, including Argentina, India, Russia, and Vietnam, responded by restricting rice and wheat exports in an attempt to keep domestic prices from rising.
