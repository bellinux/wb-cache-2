5000|$|In mid-2009 Cadbury {{replaced}} {{some of the}} {{cocoa butter}} in their non-UK chocolate products with palm oil. Despite stating this {{was a response to}} consumer demand to improve taste and texture, there was no [...] "new improved recipe" [...] claim placed on New Zealand labels. Consumer backlash was significant from environmentalists and chocolate lovers in both Australia and New Zealand, with consumers objecting to both the taste from the cheaper formulation, and the use of palm oil given its role in the destruction of rainforests. By August 2009, the company announced that it was reverting to the use of cocoa butter in New Zealand and Australia, although palm oil is still listed as an ingredient in Cadbury's <b>flavoured</b> <b>sugar</b> syrup based fillings (where it referred to as 'vegetable oil'). In addition, Cadbury stated they would source cocoa beans through Fair Trade channels. In January 2010 prospective buyer Kraft pledged to honour Cadbury's commitment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInvestigating depression-like {{conditions}} in animals is methodologically challenging, but potentially important for welfare. Some riding horses display ‘withdrawn’ states of inactivity and low responsiveness that resemble the reduced {{engagement with the}} environment shown by certain depressed patients. To assess whether these animals are experiencing a depression-like state, we investigated anhedonia – the loss of pleasure, a key symptom of human depression – in 20 withdrawn and non-withdrawn horses from the same stable. The time horses spent being withdrawn appeared unrelated to age or sex, but correlated with time devoted to stereotypic behaviour, a possible marker of lifetime stress. Comparison with data collected 5 years earlier also revealed that horses scored as withdrawn then remained significantly likely to display the behaviour. We measured sucrose intake, a classic measure of anhedonia never previously applied to horses. <b>Flavoured</b> <b>sugar</b> blocks, novel to these subjects, were mounted in each stall and weighed 3, 8, 24 and 30  h after provision. We predicted that if affected by depression-like states, the most withdrawn horses would consume the least sucrose. This prediction was met (F 1, 18  =  4. 65, two tailed p =  0. 04). This pattern could, however, potentially reflect general appetite levels and/or food neophobia. To control for these confounds, hay consumption was measured over 5 days, as were subjects’ latencies to eat a meal scented with a novel odour. Although low hay consumption and long latencies to eat scented food did predict low sucrose consumption, statistically controlling for these confounds did not eliminate the relationship between being withdrawn and consuming less sucrose (although reducing it to a strong trend) : F 1, 15  =  4. 28, two-tailed p =  0. 056. These data thus suggest long-lasting depression-like states in certain riding horses, which correlate with stereotypic behaviour and are characterised by anhedonia and bouts of ‘withdrawn’ unresponsiveness...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome riding horses display {{states of}} {{inactivity}} and low responsiveness to external stimuli that we term ‘withdrawn’, and that resemble the reduced {{engagement with the}} environment seen in clinically depressed people. To assess whether these animals are indeed affected by a depression-like condition, we investigated anhedonia: the loss of pleasure that is a core symptom of human clinical depression. Subjects were withdrawn horses and controls from the same stable (16 geldings and 4 mares, 7 - 20 years old, 85 % French Saddlebred). The time individuals spent being withdrawn was determined by a trained observer using instantaneous scan sampling every 2 minutes over 1 h long periods repeated daily over 15 days. To measure sucrose intake, a classic measure of anhedonia in rodent-based biomedical research never previously applied to horses, commercially-available <b>flavoured</b> <b>sugar</b> blocks, novel to these subjects, were mounted in each stall and weighed 3,, 24 and 30 h after provision. We hypothesized that if depressed-like, withdrawn horses would consume less sucrose than controls. Horses spending the most time withdrawn did show reduced sucrose consumption (F 1, 18 = 4. 65, P= 0. 04, in a repeated measures model also controlling for age, sex, and the time each horse spent in its stall – thus able to eat the sucrose – during testing). We then controlled for two possible alternative explanations for this pattern: neophobia towards novel foods, and generally low appetites. Hay consumption was measured over 5 days, as were subjects’ latencies to eat a meal scented with a novel odour. When included in our model, high hay consumption strongly tended to predict high sucrose consumption (F 1, 14 = 4. 52, P= 0. 051), while long latencies to eat a novel food predicted low sucrose consumption (F 1, 14 = 8. 34, P= 0. 012). However, statistically controlling for these two confounds did not eliminate the relationship between being withdrawn and consuming less sucrose (although reducing it to a strong trend: F 1, 15 = 4. 28, P= 0. 056), suggesting that neither overall food consumption levels nor neophobic reactions explained our previous findings. Overall, this study illustrates the methodological challenges of investigating anhedonia in non-conventional species; reveals possible depression-like conditions in riding horses; and suggests a way of assess anhedonia in other animals showing profound inactivity (e. g. working equids in the developing world) ...|$|E
