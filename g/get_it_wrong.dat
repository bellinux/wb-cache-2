Brandy McDonnell of The Oklahoman described Outlaw Run as the highlight of Silver Dollar City: [...] "it's a speedy and spine-tingling ride worth waiting a few hours to take".

She {{was one of those}} East End snobs. I drew on all of those experiences." [...] In a 2009 radio {{interview}} with Dale Winton, Windsor said three people have influenced her portrayal of Peggy: Violet Kray (thus retracting her earlier statement), her own mother, and the actor Mike Reid, who played her on-screen husband Frank Butcher.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the events}} of [...] "The Bells of Saint John", in which he {{encountered}} a third version of Clara, the Doctor decides {{to learn more about}} his new companion and travels into her past to observe her. He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager. The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara, then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet, with a shining pyramid on one of them. The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens, including a merchant named Dor'een who attempts to rent them a space bike. The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value; this appalls Clara, who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away. She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl (Emilia Jones) who appears to be running and hiding. Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry Galel, the Queen of Years. Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed to sing a song at a ceremony and she is afraid to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong.</b> Clara reassures her by telling her what her mother once said, and Merry heads to the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A terrific episode, with Homer so stupid it isn't true, yet still saving the day. Seeing Ned Flanders <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong</b> is great, but the show-stealer is a toss-up between Borgnine's great self-deprecating role, the ironic seagull, and the dolphins." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called it a [...] "brilliant episode from start to finish". He commented that [...] "We see what an amazing amount {{of goods and services}} one can purchase in Springfield with only $20, and we get a fun spoof of scouting. Add to that terrific rivalry moments between Bart and Homer and the show excels." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict called the plot of the episode [...] "typically inspired", and gave it a grade of A. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 5 out of 5. TV DVD Reviews's Kay Daly wrote: [...] "And just when you think the Simpsons creators have taken parody as far as it can go, they air an episode like this. The writers cram the 22-minute episode with allusions to movie genres including disaster movies, Broadway musicals, adventure-suspense and classic teen horror." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it one of his ten favorite episodes of the show. He called the musical sequence a [...] "classic". Rick Porter of Zap 2 It wrote in that he was not a [...] "fan" [...] of the episode's second half: [...] "Despite the presence of Borgnine, Homer is a little too aggressively stupid for my taste". He thought the first part was [...] "absolutely brilliant", though.|$|E

2500|$|This {{has led to}} {{continuity}} problems. Early {{histories of}} races such as the Daleks were rewritten. Writer Paul Cornell, discussing continuity errors, opines that the modern programme's Time War can explain away (or retcon) such discontinuities, giving the example of Earth's different destructions in The Ark (1966) and [...] "The End of the World" [...] (2005). Writer and Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes {{and the concept of}} changing time can't have a continuity error – it's impossible for Doctor Who to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong,</b> because we can just say 'he changed time'".|$|E

Steven Moffat, writer and later executive producer for Doctor Who, has gone further, arguing that [...] "a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes and the concept of changing time can't have a continuity error—it's impossible for Doctor Who to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong,</b> because we can just say 'he changed time—it's a time ripple from the Time War.|$|E

[...] He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendences. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. [...] "The need to be loved was the root of it," [...] he said.

2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong</b> when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tie-breakers {{are only}} done for {{students}} who tie, but {{did not get a}} perfect score. [...] They are sometimes used in the case for when money or prizes are being distributed to the winners of the competition, and a tie breaker will be used even if both students have a perfect score. [...] Tie-breakers are conducted according to the [...] "sudden death" [...] method. [...] For example, in a tie-breaker, if student A scored the same as student B, and each missed 1 question, the student who missed question #5 will win over the student who missed question #3; students who start missing questions last are ranked higher, given same scores. [...] If the sudden death method doesn't resolve the tie, in other words both students have exactly the same answers, then a tie-breaker question is made and the person to turn in the correct answer the fastest wins the tie. [...] If both <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong</b> or if both turn in the correct answer at the same time then the process is repeated until the tie is resolved. [...] All students that get a perfect score are considered to place 1st. [...] Due to the large number of students, as compared to a typical high school classroom, who participate in competitions, scantrons are used as answer sheets; their main advantage is that they can be graded by a computer. [...] These are similar in type to the answer sheets used in standardized tests such as the SAT and the ACT.|$|E

[...] Forced to stay apart {{from the rest of the}} cast to prevent the public or press from suspecting his involvement in series two, Gravelle used his sense of isolation to bring his character to life. Gravelle said he found that the key to his character in series two was desperation. Joe Miller, he said, sought spiritual relief in both series one and two out of a desperate bid to feel better about himself and his crime. His not-guilty plea in series two, Gravelle felt, was also motivated by desperation (rather than a months-long plan to expose the town's secrets).|$|E
