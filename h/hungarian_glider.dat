2500|$|In the 1930s most glider pilots {{began on}} very simple, single seat aircraft, very often open frame {{machines}} like the Zögling, then faced the {{difficult task of}} converting to the large soaring and aerobatic gliders of the day. The 1931 Grunau Baby was becoming a popular intermediate trainer, a candidate to fill the gap at least for slope soaring. [...] Though rather {{little is known about the}} Vándor, it seems to have been intended to play the same role in the developing but unstructured <b>Hungarian</b> <b>glider</b> scene, capable of soaring and aerobatics. The influence of the 1931 Baby on the Vandor is seen in the similarity of layouts, though the designs are significantly different.|$|E
2500|$|The Karakán was {{designed}} {{at the request}} of the Hungarian Boy Scouts Association, which wanted a new <b>Hungarian</b> <b>glider</b> to represent the sport at the 1933 Jamboree. It was built in their workshops and made its first flight on 4 August 1933, during the Jamboree. A second Karakán was built in the workshops of the Aviation Section of the Hungarian Defence Association (MOVERO), flying on 29 April 1935. Between them they set a series of Hungarian national gliding records and Rotter used it to become the first Hungarian to gain a Silver C. [...] When the first example retired in 1939 it was placed on display in the Hungarian Technical and Transportation Museum, Budapest, where it was destroyed in the fighting towards the end of World War II. The second was destroyed in a hangar fire in 1942.|$|E
