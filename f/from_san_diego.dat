5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Yancey was reactivated as part of President John F. Kennedy's bid to build up the U.S. Navy. On 17 November 1961, Yancey was recommissioned at Portland, Oregon, with Captain Gordon R. Keating in command. The ship departed <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> on 12 January 1962 and reached Norfolk, her new assigned home port, on 2 February, there becoming the newest member of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 12.

5|$|The species syntypes were {{collected}} <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> Bay, California. The specific epithet dipterura {{is derived from}} the Latin di ("two"), ptero ("wing"), and ura ("tail"), referring to the fin folds on both sides of its tail. Rat-tailed stingray is a former common name for this species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, based on morphology, determined the diamond stingray and the bluntnose stingray (D.say) of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species, that likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma). In addition, the two were found to be the second-most basal taxa in their genus, after the common stingray (D.pastinaca).|$|E

5|$|In 1931, the County Board of Supervisors {{agreed to}} submit the Campo road for {{consideration}} as a secondary state highway. The state considered {{the inclusion of}} the Campo road into the system in 1932. The California State Legislature defined Route200 in 1933 as a route <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to west of Jacumba, going through the town of Campo. The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935, and the road was paved that year. The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare the road a military highway to receive federal assistance for its improvement. Signs were posted for SR94 in 1937, and by 1938, SR94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard (later Federal Boulevard) before continuing east to Campo.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado Canyon Road <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to La Mesa was {{originally}} built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass {{of the old}} US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960, and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962. Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce. In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed. By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard {{was one of the}} first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Midway area {{is former}} {{marshland}} {{which has been}} filled in for development. In fact, the San Diego River used to flow through the Midway area into San Diego Bay, isolating Point Loma <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego.</b> Because of fears that San Diego Bay might silt up, the river was diverted to its present course north of Point Loma by a levee built in 1877. Parts of Liberty Station and Point Loma Village are also fill land, reclaimed from sand spits and wetlands surrounding the Bay. The only remnant of the formerly extensive wetlands in Point Loma, aside from the riverbed itself, is a city-owned nature preserve called Famosa Slough, which branches off from the river near its mouth.|$|E

5|$|During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Saratoga and Lexington {{were able}} to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two {{carriers}} were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.|$|E
5|$|I-8 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and is {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System from I-5 to the western junction of SR98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after the local Native American tribe and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 11,800vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR115, as well as between SR98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1927, Shoup {{and nine}} other {{officers}} were pulled from training to accompany a detachment of Marines sent to China to protect American interests during {{the instability of}} the Chinese Civil War. Embarking <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> with the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, Shoup's contingent was to play a primarily defensive role, and not engage in military action. Still, he was personally opposed to the mission, feeling that Americans in China were exploiting its people. The contingent landed in Shanghai on 10 June aboard USS Chaumont. Initially, they conducted shore patrol around American sections of the city. On 5 July the battalion was moved to Tientsin to protect American interests there should Chinese Nationalist troops threaten them. Shoup became seriously ill there, and remained hospitalized until it was announced U.S. troops would leave. He briefly returned to Shanghai to oversee foreign troop departures with the 4th Marines, before he departed from China on 7 December 1928.|$|E

5|$|Philippine Sea {{completed}} her first deployment to Korea {{and arrived at}} San Francisco on 9 June 1951. It conducted refits, repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued {{for the remainder of}} the year. On 19 December, she was the site of a test for an emergency nuclear weapon assembly, the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship. The ship departed <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> on 31 December 1951. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952, Philippine Sea continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea, arriving 20 January 1952 with Carrier Air Group 11, which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair, about 100 aircraft. During this tour, the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized, and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets, including the 23 June attack on the Sui-ho Dam in conjunction with Boxer, Princeton, and , and sending aircraft against targets in Pyongyang.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{replaced}} a 1912 plank road {{across much}} of Imperial County. The winding two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains {{was one of the}} factors that led to a four-hour journey <b>from</b> <b>San</b> <b>Diego</b> to El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80.|$|E
