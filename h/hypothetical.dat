5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, <b>hypothetical</b> generalized mollusc, or <b>hypothetical</b> ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an intelligent tutoring system, LARGO, that helps students learn skills of legal reasoning with <b>hypotheticals</b> by analyzing oral arguments before the US Supreme Court. The skills involve proposing a rule-like test for deciding a case, posing <b>hypotheticals</b> {{to challenge the}} rule, and responding by analogizing or distinguishing the <b>hypotheticals</b> and/or modifying the proposed test. Using LARGO, students diagram argument transcripts in a special-purpose graphical language. LARGO provides {{feedback in the form}} of reflection questions...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hypotheticals</b> {{could be}} {{important}} because they provide a means for understanding {{what we would do}} if the world was different. Although this may assist our understanding of risk, and help us plan and create a new and better future, <b>hypotheticals</b> also help us understand the past, and why things happened or how things work. For example, in seeking to understand why a war started we could ask: [...] "What if the parties had talked more first? Would they have worked out a better way of solving their problems? Could war have been averted?" [...] <b>Hypotheticals</b> about the past are challenging to consider, as {{it is not possible to}} enter the past to change things according to our <b>hypotheticals</b> and determine what then may have occurred.|$|R

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and <b>hypothetical</b> imperatives. A <b>hypothetical</b> imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a <b>hypothetical</b> imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike <b>hypothetical</b> imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

5000|$|The HYPO {{project set}} out to model the {{creation}} of <b>hypotheticals</b> in law, where no case matches well enough. HYPO uses <b>hypotheticals</b> {{for a variety of}} tasks necessary for good interpretation: [...] "to redefine old situations in terms of new dimensions, to create new standard cases when an appropriate one doesn’t exist, to explore and test the limits of a concept, to refocus a case by excluding some issues and to organize or cluster cases". <b>Hypotheticals</b> can include facts that support two conflicting lines of reasoning. So, it makes and responds to arguments from competing viewpoints about who should win the dispute. HYPO use heuristics such as making a case weaker or stronger, making a case extreme, enabling a [...] "near-miss", disabling a [...] "near-hit" [...] to generate <b>hypotheticals</b> {{in the context of an}} argument by using the dimensions mechanism. Dimensions have a range of values, along which the supportive strength that may shift from one side to the other. What differentiated this expert system from others was its facility not only to return a primary to best-case response but to return near-best-fit responses as well.|$|R

5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. <b>Hypothetical</b> univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the <b>hypothetical</b> MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the <b>hypothetical</b> Ca+ cation.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} verbal amplifiers and comical <b>hypotheticals</b> in a corpus of face-to-face interactions. Both phenomena qualify as markers {{of a mental}} viewpoint expressing an (inter) subjective construal of a certain experience. Whereas amplifiers offer a straightforward view onto a speaker’s evaluative stance, comical <b>hypotheticals</b> provide an intersubjective account of a viewpoint construal. As part of their meaning, their use reveals a speaker’s assumption about the interlocutor willing to allow or participate in {{a particular type of}} interactional humor. Our research interest for these phenomena concerns their occurrence as well as their interactional alignment in terms of mimicry behavior. In order to capture the impact of both linguistic and psychological variables in the use of these items, we adopt a differentiated methodological approach, which allows to correlate findings from our corpus linguistic analysis with the values obtained for interpersonal differences variables. As our data consists of male dyads of which the participants never met before the beginning of their conversation, we expected to witness an increase, along with the growing familiarity among the interlocutors, in both the use and alignment of these viewpoint phenomena. Indeed, results show a clear increase in the use of both verbal amplifiers and comical <b>hypotheticals</b> {{over the course of the}} interaction and independently from the also observed overall increase of communicativeness. However, with respect to the alignment of both viewpoint phenomena, our study reveals a differentiated result. Participants aligned their use of verbal amplifiers with that of their partners over the course of the interaction, but they did not do so for comical <b>hypotheticals.</b> Yet, within the broader discussion of the experiment’s design, this unexpected result may still seem plausible with respect to our general hypothesis. Beyond the limits of this study, the set-up and results of our study nicely connect to recent research on empathy-related behavior in social neuroscience. status: publishe...|$|R

This Article considers whether these philosophical discussions might contribute to the public policy debate over compensation for auto accidents. Using liability and insurance practices in the United States as an illustrative example, the Article explains that auto liability insurance substantially mitigates moral luck and argues that, as a result, the moral luck literature is unlikely to make a significant contribution to this public policy debate. The debate would benefit more from philosophical analysis of victims’ luck, which is not as substantially mitigated by liability insurance...|$|R
