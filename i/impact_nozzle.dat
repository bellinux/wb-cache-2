40|$|Abstract- In this study, copper-indium-sulfide (CuInS 2) {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on {{soda lime glass}} substrates using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique from the aqueous solution of Copper(II) chloride-dehydrate (CuCl 2), indium(III) chloride (InCl 3) and thiourea (NH 2 CSNH 2). To investigate the effect of film thickness, different solution amounts were sprayed. As expected, {{the thickness of the}} films increased with increasing the amount of solution used. It has been obtained that thickness of the CuInS 2 absorber layer is critical for structural, morphological and optical properties. Crystal structure of the spray-deposited films was confirmed using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. The crystallite size of the films was ranging between 12. 37 and 26. 72 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study revealed that Cu concentration in the films increased by increasing the solution amount. Surface morphology of the films was investigated via scanning electron microscope (SEM). All sprayed films were defect free. Moreover, Cu rich-island formation was observed on the surface of CuInS 2 films sprayed using solutions more than 20 ml. Optical band gap energy of the films decreased from 2. 85 to 1. 40 eV with increasing the solution amount. As a result, thin films deposited using 30 ml solution was superior to others in terms of structural and optical properties. Moreover, {{it is very important to}} mention here that the ultrasonic <b>impact</b> <b>nozzle</b> used in this study enabled using very little amount of solution (0. 015 ml/mm 2), which is approximately 10 times lower than solution reported previously. This promising result can be the key for large-area manufacturing of CuInS 2 based solar cells...|$|E

The purpose of this project was to evaluate a relatively new technology known as Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA) irrigation to obtain Saskatchewan specific performance data for this technology. Preliminary studies were conducted on small, research scale, linear and centre pivot systems. Afterwards, a two tower centre pivot irrigation system equipped with standard <b>impact</b> <b>nozzles</b> was modified by the addition of LESA equipment: drop tubes and low pressure nozzles with static spray pads. This system was capable of operating either standard above lateral mounted impact sprinklers or LESA technology on the same piece of land. Later, seven field scale systems with various makes of nozzles and spray pads were added to the study to ensure that the data collected from the research systems was applicable to field conditions. For all of the systems tested the, coefficient of uniformity, application efficiency and specific energy consumption were determined and compared for a variety of wind speeds. Results showed that for the two tower research centre pivot the coefficient of uniformity was similar for impact and LESA technology with static spray pads. The application efficiency for the <b>impact</b> <b>nozzles</b> and low pressure nozzles showed that, while they both had a trend in decreasing efficiency with increasing wind speeds, the low pressure nozzles had a better efficiency at all wind speeds. The trends showed that the application efficiency for the <b>impact</b> <b>nozzles</b> ranged from approximately 69 % to 86 % and the low pressure nozzles ranged from approximately 74 % to 98 % indicating an average efficiency gain of approximately 8 % greater for the LESA technology. The energy consumed by both the impact and LESA systems indicated that both systems had an increasing energy consumption with increasing wind speed. However, the low pressure system showed a trend of using on average, one half of the energy required by the medium pressure system (0. 107 kWh/m 3 as compared to 0. 057 kWh/m 3) to deliver the same amount of water. Field comparisons indicated that the system equipped with the same LESA technology as the research system (drop nozzles and static spray pads) had similar results for coefficient of uniformity, application efficiency and specific energy consumption. Field systems equipped with spinner or rotator spray pads showed an increase in all factors measured.

40|$|Modern {{spray rate}} {{controllers}} along with {{technologies such as}} automatic section control (ASC) provide benefits such as overlap reduction on agricultural sprayers. However, product (liquid) dynamics within the boom plumbing affect off-rate errors and application uniformity during rate changes and ASC actuation. Therefore, {{this study was conducted}} to compare nozzle flow stability and uniformity across the boom when using two different boom shut-off valves (2 -way and metered 3 -way) on an 18. 3 -m sprayer boom. Pressure transducers were mounted at 1) the boom manifold, 2) randomly at 12 nozzle bodies across the spray boom, and 3) upstream and downstream of the flow regulating valve. Effective system flow rate was measured using two flow meter(s), one located upstream of the boom control valves (2 -way or metered 3 -way) and another mounted to measure the tank return flow for the metered 3 -way boom valve. Measured nozzle pressure was converted to nozzle flow using the manufacturer’s pressure-flow data. Results indicated that the 2 -way boom versus metered 3 -way valve response was significantly different. Significant differences in damping ratios were found when exiting (under-damped) and reentering (over-damped) of spray zones. For the metered 3 -way boom valve configuration, nozzle flow settled faster (0. 1 to 4. 2 s) virtually eliminating off-rate errors whereas the 2 -way boom valve configuration took up to 34. 3 s to settle with off-rate errors ranging from 3. 3 % to 11. 5 %. The delayed nozzle flow settling times were associated with pressure settling (0. 7 to 31. 4 s) downstream of the regulating valve for the 2 -way configuration. Ground speed and point row angle <b>impacted</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow settling times and off-rate errors. The increase in ground speed and point row angle increased nozzle flow settling time for the 2 -way valve setup, except that acceleration decreased settling times when exiting spray zones. The delayed response contributed to off-rate time which decreased as the sprayer accelerated and point row angle decreased for both the 2 -way (1. 7 to 19. 3 s) and metered 3 -way (2. 1 to 4. 4 s) boom shut-off valve setups...|$|R

40|$|The aeroacoustic {{performance}} of several generic nozzle geometries was tested {{to evaluate the}} potential benefits of using non-round jet exit geometries to reduce noise from combat military aircraft. Both the aerodynamics and far field acoustics of several M(sub d) = 1. 5 and 2. 0 round, elliptic, and rectangular nozzles, including an augmented deflector exhaust nozzle (ADEN), were studied to assess noise emission. The nozzles were operated to jet total temperatures, T(sub 0) = 1160 degree R, and the data scaled to constant thrust. The data were propagated to 1500 ft. and corrected to perceived noise level.

Far-field acoustic results, presented previously, showed that increasing aspect ratios increased the high frequency noise, especially directed in the polar plane containing the minor axis of the nozzle. The measurements presented here have important implications in the modeling of turbulent sources for acoustic analogy theories.

40|$|Reducing or {{eliminating}} the operational restrictions of supersonic aircraft over populated areas {{has led to}} extensive research at NASA. Restrictions were due to the disturbance of the sonic boom, caused by the coalescence of shock waves formed off the aircraft.

Results show how the shock generated at the nozzle lip affects the near field pressure signature, and thereby the potential sonic boom contribution for a nozzle at vector angles from 3 to 8. The experiment was based on the NASA F- 15 nozzle used in the Lift and Nozzle Change Effects on Tail Shock experiment, which possessed a large external boat-tail angle.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} characterization of heat transfer effects on performance and operation of a MEMS-based supersonic nozzle is reported. Owing to the large surface {{area to volume ratio}} and inherently low Reynolds numbers (Re < 1000) of a MEMS device, wall phenomena such as heat transfer and viscous forces play critical roles in shaping performance characteristics of the micronozzle. Substantial viscous subsonic layers can grow sufficiently large on the expander walls, inhibit flow through the nozzle, and potentially merge together causing the flow to be subsonic at the nozzle exit; this causes a reduction in thruster efficiency and performance. Heat transfer from the flow into the surrounding substrate can significantly alter this subsonic layer and impact overall thrust production. In this study the flow of decomposed hydrogen peroxide monopropellant is simulated in a converging-diverging supersonic micro-scale nozzle. The flow field is analyzed to determine subsonic layer growth on the micronozzle walls with varying degrees of heat transfer to the surrounding substrate in order to characterize the <b>impact</b> on <b>nozzle</b> performance. 3 D simulations are performed for several micrnozzle depths (25 μm, 50 μm, and 200 μm) at Reynolds number between 30 − 800 while varying the amount of heat transfer.

Similarly, thrust production is shown to be enhanced with heat transfer via Rayleigh flow and an increased gas density at the nozzle exit. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the requirement for higher output of diesel engines in recent years, IHI has recognized that a turbocharger with higher pressure-ratio and volume-flow rate will be required, and has commenced the development of such a turbocharger. An important consideration in the design is the relatively high failure rate of blades presently used in the market. The new turbocharger will need to rotate at a faster speed than similarly-sized turbochargers of the past. Therefore the turbine and compressor blades will be subjected to excessive centrifugal force and it is forecast that strength problems will become increasingly severe. Under such severe operating conditions, damage to the turbine blades and compressor blades is possible {{as a result of}} prolonged resonance due to the <b>impact</b> of <b>nozzle</b> wake and pressure distribution. The design life of a loaded blade may be predicted from the centrifugal force and resonance stress to which it is subjected. Centrifugal force may be calculated using a finite element model. However, the prediction of resonance is unreliable as the value of the stimulus (refer to Eq. (1)) of the blade at resonance is not necessarily clear. The stimulus value becomes more difficult to measure as the rotor speed becomes higher due to damage to the sensor attached to the rotating body and problems related to axial vibration. Therefore, only a small amount of data has been obtained in the past.

The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate navigation through the ice field based on variables such as time through course, number of <b>impacts,</b> and <b>nozzle</b> executions. Na participants were assigned to groups: group one completed physical training in the classroom and in the TEMPSC in calm water (Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping, STCW), group two completed the same STCW training complemented by a classroom briefing on ice navigation, and group three completed the classroom briefing on ice navigation along with simulator training (full mission class 2 ̆ 01 cS 2 ̆ 01 d training simulator). Through a comparison of these groups it was hoped that the simulator-trained participants would perform just as well, or better, than those who underwent the physical training in terms of effectiveness and proficiency in ice field navigation. Overall, the results of this study suggest that simulator-trained participants were more likely to successfully navigate the TEMPSC through the ice field from waypoint to waypoint in comparison to those who received standard STCW training or the STCW training complemented by an ice briefing. Due to a small sample size, relatively large amounts of variance, and frequently changing environmental conditions, significant differences between the groups may have been masked. As such, further research may be required to conclusively validate small craft simulation training for operation in ice-covered waters. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to acquire more insight into the {{relationship}} between wall and piston impingement of liquid fuel and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions (UHC) emissions, under early direct injection (EDI) premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) operating conditions. To this end, the vaporization process is modeled for various operating conditions using a commercial CFD code (StarCD). Predicted values for liquid core penetration, or liquid length LL, have been successfully checked against experimental data from literature over a wide range of operating conditions. Next, the correlation between the CFD results for wall and piston impingement and measured UHC emissions is studied. The diesel fuel used in the experiments is modeled as n-dodecane and n-heptadecane, representing the low and high end of the diesel boiling range, respectively. A distinction is made between liquid spray impingement on the piston surface and cylinder liner. For a conventional DI diesel nozzle, the high UHC emissions in the EDI PCCI regime correlate well with modeled cylinder wall impingement. Conversely, piston impingement is negligible in this regime. Accordingly, it may be assumed that the primary cause for high UHC emissions in the EDI PCCI regime, using conventional DI nozzles, is caused by liquid spray impingement against the cylinder liner. In this regime it was found that a higher intake and fuel temperature, as well as an elevated intake pressure have a positive effect on both UHC emissions and the spray impingement against the cylinder wall. This provides additional evidence that the two parameters (i. e., UHC and wall impingement) are linked. Lastly, the <b>impact</b> of <b>nozzle</b> cone angle is investigated. When adopting a narrow cone angle nozzle in the EDI PCCI regime, wall impingement is negligible and piston wetting becomes the dominant source of UHC emissions...|$|R

The numerical simulation of the moving object will be performed with a Q 1 D unsteady model of the SRM internal ballistics, as presented in the following section. The idea is, in fact, to obtain from the simulations a feeling about the physics of the problem, without having to face too high computational costs and complexities for the simulation.

Drop size distribution data were collected for different types of sprinklers with various nozzle size-pressure combinations using a laser-optical method. Drop velocities were calculated using a trajectory model. The overall drop energy per unit of applied water was calculated. A method was developed to estimate the kinetic energy for {{a particular type of}} sprinkler with a given nozzle size and operating pressure using nozzle size and pressure head as independent variables. The volume mean drop size was found to be a good predictor of overall kinetic energy. With no wind, the overall drop energy varied from about 5 to 25 Pkg. The smooth plate spray head gave the least drop energy, while the single nozzle, impact-type sprinklers gave the greatest. Wind was found to increase drop energy by as much as a factor of three, but nozzle elevation had a small effect on drop energy. Keywords. Energy, Irrigation, Sprinklers.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} {{on the development}} of AJM technology and the associated sciences has been conducted and presented. Although AJM is a promising technology for micromachining, it has been found that most studies in this field have been oriented towards high-pressure abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting, while little {{attention has been paid to}} micromachining using low-pressure jets with air as the jet fluid. The work in this thesis is aimed to address some of the issues identified with a specific objective of gaining a further and deeper understanding of the machining process and process performance and developing machining performance models for micro-grooving with low pressure abrasive air jets. An experimental study on the abrasive jet micromachining process using low-pressure air jets has been carried out to understand the relationship between the process parameters (i. e. nozzle diameter, air pressure, abrasive mass flowrate, jet <b>impact</b> angle, <b>nozzle</b> traverse speed) and major cutting performance measures (i. e. groove depth and width, kerf taper angle and roughness of the groove bottom surface). It has been found that increasing the air pressure increases the groove depth and width and decreases the kerf taper angle, while abrasive mass flowrate does not have a significant effect on the groove depth and width and the surface roughness. In addition, it is revealed that the maximum jet penetration occurs at near orthogonal jet impact angles. The effects of the process parameters on the various major cutting performance measures have thus been amply studied with the significance of each parameter identified by a statistical analysis. Recommendations are then made for the selection of process variables for micromachining of quartz crystals. Predictive models for the major cutting performance measures, which are essential for the optimisation of the micromachining process, are developed based on dimensional and statistical analysis. The developed models relate the major performance measures to the process parameters in abrasive micro-jet grooving, and have been verified by comparing their predictions with the data from a separate experiment. The assessments of the predicted models show that the developed models have been correctly formulated and can give adequate prediction of the cutting performance...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an integral}} part of crop production and ground-based agricultural boom sprayers are used extensively to apply pesticides to the crop canopy or soil surface across millions of acres in the United States. Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on spray pattern uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on spray pattern distribution, 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and spray pattern) to assess sensitivity for predicting boom distribution errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the <b>impact</b> of <b>nozzle</b> setup and operational errors on spray pattern uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in spray nozzle distribution which may not be completely detectable by measuring spray pattern alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in spray pattern CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full boom spray distributions based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} method is developed here to investigate agglomeration in spray drying towers operating with multiple nozzles. It allows studying independently {{the contribution of}} each spray to the product and obtaining a valuable insight into the agglomeration processes. The paper studies a two level swirl counter-current dryer of detergent in a full-scale production system. It shows that operation with two nozzle levels increases the energy efficiency {{compared to the use}} of single sprays, but in turn promotes both agglomeration and elutriation of powder {{from the top of the}} dryer. The product size distribution becomes bi-modal and the composition and porosity of the product more heterogeneous due to the different thermal histories experienced by droplets from each spray. The method described here controls the air temperature and humidity nearby the nozzles to quantify the agglomerates resulting from particle contacts within each individual spray or from their interaction. Particle agglomeration is shown to be suppressed at the bottom of the dryer where the heat transfer rates are highest and promoted at the top spray, which originates a second coarse mode in the size distribution. Both levels do not operate independently; the powder elutriated upwards from the bottom nozzle is captured entirely by the top spray when it is centrally located. By isolating the independent <b>impact</b> of each <b>nozzle</b> in a dryer, the method provides powerful data to correlate the agglomeration behaviour with local process conditions, and so facilitate the development and validation of spray dryer models...|$|R
40|$|Effervescent {{atomization}} {{uses the}} internal gas-liquid mixture to produce spray. The behavior of two-phase flow inside the atomizer influences the spray characteristics and {{is dependent on}} the atomizer internal geometry and operating conditions. The present study is conducted in two parts; study of the bubble formation from a novel submerged nozzle in a liquid cross-flow and investigation of the internal and external two-phase flows in an effervescent atomizer. The present study investigated the performance of a novel nozzle developed by Gadallah and Siddiqui (2013) in the liquid cross-flow. The <b>impact</b> of the <b>nozzle</b> shape, its configurations and orientations was experimentally investigated. The results showed that the novel nozzle generates smaller bubbles at higher detachment frequency for all cases compared to the standard nozzle. It is found that the elastic rebound of the bubble from a side hole {{plays a key role in}} the early bubble detachment. For the effervescent atomizer study, the impact of atomizer’s internal geometry on the internal flow and spray droplet characteristics were studied. The results demonstrated that a conical base aerator tube and shorter mixing zone length provide more uniform bubbles in smaller size. A new type of bubble breaker was designed and tested in an effervescent atomizer. The results show that both internal and external two-phase flows in the atomizer were strongly influenced by bubble breaker configurations (diameter and number of holes). It was found that the liquid shear stress is the dominant force causing the bubble elongation and its eventual breakup...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to numerically simulate a fluid jet injected into a crossflow of the same or another fluid, respectively. Such flows are encountered in many engineering applications in which cooling or mixing plays an important role, e. g. gas turbine combustors. The jet in crossflow (JICF) is used both for cooling and for injecting liquid fuel into the air stream prior to combustion. The numerical simulations regard three space dimensions and track also the flow dynamics by integrating the governing equations in time. The spatial and the temporal resolution are such that the large-scale flow structures are resolved. Such an approach {{is referred to as}} large eddy simulations (LES). The motion of the fuel droplets is treated by Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) with the stochastic parcel method, along with submodels for evaporation, collision, breakup, and a novel submodel for aerodynamic four-way coupling: The particle drag is corrected depending on relative positions of the particles. Mixture fraction and temperature transport equations are solved to enable the modeling of droplet evaporation and the mixing of the gaseous fuel with ambient air. In the simulations of multiphase JICF, several computed results are shown to be inconsistent with the underlying assumptions of the LPT approach: The magnitude of the Weber numbers indicates that droplets are not spherical in large portions of the flow field in wide ranges of parameters which are relevant for gas turbine operation. The magnitude of the droplet spacing suggests that aerodynamic interaction (indirect four-way coupling) among droplets may be important. The LES with aerodynamic four-way coupling reveals significant effects compared to two-way coupling for monodisperse particles in a dense multiphase flow. For single-phase JICF, the <b>impact</b> of <b>nozzle</b> shape on the large-scale coherent structures and the mixing is studied. Effects of circular, square, and elliptic nozzles and their orientation are considered. It is demonstrated that square and elliptic nozzles with blunt orientation raise turbulence levels significantly. The scalar distribution in a cross-sectional plane is found to be single-peaked for these nozzles whereas circular and the nozzles with pointed orientation show double-peaked scalar distribution. It is the nozzles with a single-peaked distribution which are the better mixers. The differences and similarities of single- and multiphase JICF are compared, and it is demonstrated that the flow field solution for multiphase flow approaches the flow field solution of single-phase flow in the limit of small Stokes numbers...|$|R
40|$|There was {{interest}} {{in understanding the}} <b>impact</b> of out-of-round <b>nozzle</b> extension on the nozzle side load during transient startup operations. The out-of-round nozzle extension could {{be the result of}} asymmetric internal stresses, deformation induced by previous tests, and asymmetric loads induced by hardware attached to the nozzle. The objective of this study was therefore to computationally investigate the effect of out-of-round nozzle extension on the nozzle side loads during an engine startup transient. The rocket engine studied encompasses a regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle, along with a film cooled nozzle extension. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and transient inlet boundary flow properties derived from an engine system simulation. Six three-dimensional cases were performed with the out-of-roundness achieved by three different degrees of ovalization, elongated on lateral y and z axes: one slightly out-of-round, one more out-of-round, and one significantly out-of-round. The results show that the separation line jump was the primary source of the peak side loads. Comparing to the peak side load of the perfectly round nozzle, the peak side loads increased for the slightly and more ovalized nozzle extensions, and either increased or decreased for the two significantly ovalized nozzle extensions. A theory based on the counteraction of the flow destabilizing effect of an exacerbated asymmetrical flow caused by a lower degree of ovalization, and the flow stabilizing effect of a more symmetrical flow, created also by ovalization, is presented to explain the observations obtained in this effort...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide {{applications}} {{are a common}} component of crop production systems in the United States (US). For row crop systems (e. g. corn, soybean, or wheat), pesticides are applied by ground, aerial, or chemigation methods. The exact method of pesticide delivery is not universally regulated/ prescribed in the US, and the equipment and application technique are largely defined by the individual applicator. A wide variety of choices and decisions must be made by applicators {{to result in a}} successful pesticide application. Examples of these choices include proper active ingredient(s), carrier volume and equipment (e. g. nozzle type, spacing, and operating pressure) selection while also considering environmental influences such as wind speed and temperature. However, applicators are often limited in guidance on making successful applications, and this can result in off-target movement of the pesticide(s) causing unintentional injury to vegetation, environmental contamination, and/or human exposure. This has prompted several state and federal agencies to monitor pesticide applications and development strategies or programs to reduce off-target movements of pesticides. ^ The objectives of the current research were to 1) incorporate and expand upon the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drift reduction technology (DRT) guidelines using a wind tunnel laboratory, 2) characterize the droplet size, velocity, pattern uniformity, and drift potential of commonly used application nozzles for ground systems in the US, and 3) bridge laboratory and field studies in pesticide application technology using established and new methodologies. ^ The data from this research aided {{in the development of a}} robust application technology program within the University of Nebraska and advanced the EPA DRT guidelines for wind tunnel testing of pesticides. Furthermore, the data demonstrated the <b>impacts</b> of ground <b>nozzle</b> selection upon the drift potential of new and existing herbicides in the US. The methods and equipment utilized in this research will be beneficial to researchers in application technology and can serve as a foundation for future experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|In the spring, apple {{orchards}} {{are susceptible}} to freeze damage. Various approaches to orchard protection {{have been used in}} the past. Overhead sprinkling for bloom delay has been effective in extending to a later period in the spring the freeze hardiness of apple buds. Thus, protection against a late spring freeze is obtained. Previous research has not been conducted to determine optimum sprinkling times in the spring, the most effective threshold temperature, the amount of water needed to provide adequate bud protection, and the daily length of sprinkling time. A 2 -year investigation was conducted with the objective of obtaining basic information to help in system design and the operational aspects of overhead sprinkling. The experiment was designed to determine the effectiveness of a system sprinkling beginning at the end of rest and at Celsius growing degree hour accumulations relating to stages bud development. The evaluation of limited and unlimited water use and the relation to bloom delay was obtained. The two sprinkler types studied were umbrella and impact. On the umbrella sprinklers, four cycling times (1 / 2, 1 / 3, 1 / 4, and 1 / 6 time) and three threshold temperatures (7, 10, and 13 C) were tested. On the <b>impact</b> sprinkler, three <b>nozzle</b> sizes (4. 0, 3. 6, and 2. 8 mm) were evaluated. The investigation answered many questions, the most important of which were: (1) when only limited bloom delay is needed, more freeze protection can be obtained by sprinkling in the early spring than in the late spring; (2) bloom delay can be regulated by terminating sprinkling at different stages of bud development; (3) to obtain maximum delay, sprinkling should begin at the end of rest and a low threshold temperature for sprinkling should be used for sprinkler initiation; (4) when limited delay is required, greater efficiency of water use can be obtained by lowering the threshold temperature and lowering the application rate...|$|R
40|$|The leading Aeronautics program within NASA is the High Speed Research Program (HSR). The HSR program's highest {{priorities}} are high pay-off technologies for airframe and propulsion systems {{required for a}} high speed civil transport (HSCT). These priorities have been developed collaboratively with NASA, FAA and the US Industry (Boeing-McDonnell Douglas, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric). Phase one of the HSR program started on 1990, and concentrated on the environmental challenges of minimizing NOx and noise. The first program goal {{is to reduce the}} NOx emission index to less than 5 (Concord NOx index is 20 and is unacceptable), in order to have little impact on the earth's ozone layer. The second goal is to reduce noise levels to FAR Stage 3 (or better), comparable to those of subsonic aircraft (far below the Concorde noise levels that require exemptions form less stringent standards). This requirement greatly <b>impacts</b> the <b>nozzle</b> design increasing its length and complexity and poses unique sealing challenges. Phase two started in 1993 and initiated work on the technologies required for an economical HSCT. Materials technologies under development include a ceramic-matrix-composite combustion liner, lightweight materials for the nozzle, as well long-life turbomachinery disk and blade alloys. Other required materials are being developed under the DOD-IHPTET program, where there is close cooperation. Economic goals translate into the development of technologies for tri-class service, 5000 nautical mile range aircraft with a ticket price no more than 20 % over the subsonic ticket price. The potential market could be as large as 1500 aircraft, according to a Boeing study. Technology alone will not enable this airplane, yet without enabling technologies "on the shelf", it will not occur. The HSCT engine will be the largest engine ever built and operate at maximum conditions {{for long periods of time}} posing a number of challenges. The HSR engine mission requires that rotating equipment stay at take-off condition temperatures for hours not minutes per flight. Hence rotating equipment and seals must operate for many thousands of hours at extreme temperatures. It is anticipated that the nozzle will be 12 feet long and roughly 4 ft. by 5 ft. in cross-section with a nominal airflow of 800 lbs/sec. The complex function of the nozzle (including an ejector for noise attenuation) combined with long life place new demands on nozzle seal design. Three inlet configurations are under consideration with attendant sealing challenges, as will be illustrated herein. Four of these engines are required to propel a 5000 nautical mile class vehicle which demand that component reliability be at the highest possible level. In response, an HSR seals session was implemented as a part of the 1997 -Seals and Secondary Flow Workshop. Overview presentations were given for each of the following areas: inlet, turbomachinery, combustor and nozzle. The HSCT seal issues center on durability and efficiency of rotating equipment seals (including brush seals), structural seals (including rope seals and other advanced concepts), and high-speed bearing and sump seals. Tighter clearances, propulsion system size and thermal requirements represent extremes that challenge the component designers. This document provides an initial step toward defining HSR seal needs. The overview for HSR seal designs includes, defining seal objectives, summarizing sealing and materials requirements, presenting relevant seal cross-sections, and identifying technology needs for the HSR office...|$|R
