The author provides introduction of multiple ways of how the parties can limit their contractual {{liability and}} emphasize that the aim of any liability is to motivate subjects {{to pay attention to}} the opposite party's rights and assets, but in the context of Civil Code its main function is to repair damages and satisfy the injured party. The subject which is in breach of its duties therefore gets new or alternated duties, as well as the injured party gains more rights on its side. For the scope of liability, it is important to define the content of the contract as the parties see it in the moment of the contract's conclusion. The content does not consist only of rights and duties connected to the fulfilment of the contract object matter, but it also consists of duties to respect other interests of the opposite party, so the status quo in respect to matters not connected with the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> remain untouched.

40|$|The {{adverse impact}} of human {{trafficking}} on individuals, societies, countries and regions have necessitated legal and non-legal efforts being made at global, {{regional and national}} levels to combat the phenomenon. This article specifically compares South African and Mozambican approaches to countering human trafficking and provides a conceptual framework of trafficking. This does not entail a comprehensive evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} South African and Mozambican measures in combating trafficking, but a content analysis of major provisions of their anti-trafficking legislation enacted in <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children of 2000 (Palermo Protocol). It is contended that the adoption of anti-trafficking legislation by these countries signifies a willingness to comprehensively address the problem. While similarities can be observed in provisions relating to prosecution, protection, prevention, national co-ordination and co-operation as well as international co-ordination and co-operation, certain differences still exist. These differences are observed in, for example, provisions relating to reporting and investigation of cases of trafficking. While fewer powers appear to be given to the Mozambican police to investigate trafficking cases, more powers are given to the South African police. Again, while the South African legislation makes provision for extra-territorial jurisdiction regarding cases of trafficking, the Mozambican legislation has not provided for this. Despite comprehensive provisions to address human trafficking, the anti-trafficking legislation of both countries contains certain weaknesses in areas such as the provision of guidelines for victim identification. These weaknesses, it is contended, will hinder effective implementation of the anti-trafficking laws. Against this background, suggestions are made for prioritisation of the campaign against trafficking through national co-operation and co-ordination, as well as bi-lateral and multi-lateral international co-operation.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TRIPS Agreement, within <b>the</b> wider context <b>of</b> globalisation, {{has brought}} about a conflict between <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> states to promote and protect health and <b>the</b> achievement <b>of</b> economic goals pursued under the WTO regime. Since trade is <b>the</b> driving engine <b>of</b> globalisation, it is imperative that, at the very least, rules governing it do not violate human rights but rather promote them. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> IP and <b>the</b> right to health therefore lies in ensuring that <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> economic rules and institutional operations in relation to IPRs coincide with states’ obligations to promote and protect public health. [...] . This study centres on the specific debate about health and IPRs in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the WTO rules on IP protection. In terms of a human rights approach to the TRIPS Agreement, the ICESCR has been chosen for several reasons. First, the ICESCR specifically recognises both the right to health {{and the right to}} <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> inventions in clearer terms than any other human rights instrument. Secondly, at least 111 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state parties to the ICESCR are also members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WTO including a large number of developing countries. Thirdly, if one sees the ICESCR as a vehicle for <b>the</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to promote and protect human rights under the United Nations Organisation’s (UN) Charter, {{it can be argued that}} in line with article 103, the implementation and interpretation of TRIPS by all UN members states must take into account basic human rights. However, even with primary focus being on <b>the</b> ICESCR, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussion on practical issues will focus on the experiences in Sub-Saharan Africa because the inequalities and problems of access to health care are most dramatically played out in this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study is to examine the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> states to progressively realise and guarantee the right to health, and the IP rules under the TRIPS Agreement. The specific objective is to examine the relationship between the exceptions under the TRIPS Agreement and <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to protect health and <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> a consistent way of achieving a convergence between the implementation and interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two regimes in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> health.

40|$|This is the Finnish National Report, in {{accordance}} with the provisions of Article 32 of the Joint Convention, for the Fifth Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties in May 2015. The <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of the Convention and the developments of waste management after the Fourth Review Meeting, during the reporting period 2011 – 2013, are assessed in this report. It presents the recent developments and describes the waste management facilities and practices in Finland, to be reviewed and discussed by the contracting parties. As spent nuclear fuel is defined in the Finnish legislation as radioactive waste, the nuclear power plants at Loviisa and Olkiluoto are the main generators of radioactive waste. Fortum Power and Heat Oy operates two VVER units at the Loviisa site and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj two BWR units at Olkiluoto. The Loviisa units 1 and 2 were commissioned in 1977 and 1981, and the Olkiluoto units 1 and 2 in 1978 and 1980, respectively. In addition, a new nuclear power plant unit is being constructed at the Olkiluoto site. As to the future, the Decision-in-Principle, {{the first step in the}} licensing process, was made by the Government for two new reactors in 2010, one for Teollisuuden Voima Oyj at the Olkiluoto site and one for Fennovoima Oy, for which Pyhäjoki was chosen as the site in 2011. At the Olkiluoto and Loviisa sites there are interim storages for spent fuel as well as repositories for low and intermediate level radioactive wastes. Furthermore, a Triga Mark II research reactor is operated in Espoo by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. However, in 2012 VTT decided to start planning of the decommissioning and eventual shut-down of the research reactor, due to economical reasons. The four Finnish NPP units operated during the reporting period safely with high capacity factors and generated spent fuel accordingly. The generation of low and intermediate level radioactive waste was kept low. Activities and programmes related to waste management continued {{in accordance}} with the national strategy, milestones and timetable. The licensees and Posiva Oy, the spent fuel disposal implementer, showed good safety performance and safety management practices in carrying out their responsibilities in spent fuel and radioactive waste management. The main focus of activities during the reporting period was the spent nuclear fuel disposal project. The construction licence application including the safety documentation for the spent nuclear fuel encapsulation and disposal facilities was submitted to the authorities at the end of 2012. Posiva Oy is aiming to start disposal operations around 2022...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Introduction The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management {{and on the}} Safety of Radioactive Waste Management {{was adopted}} on 29 September 1997 at the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. Finland signed the Convention on 2 October 1997 and {{deposited}} the tools of acceptance on 10 February 2000. The Convention entered into force on 18 June 2001. This report is the 6 th Finnish National Report under the Joint Convention {{in accordance with the}} provisions of Article 32. It will be subject to review in May 2018 in the sixth Review Meeting of the contracting parties in Vienna. The <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> of the Convention and the development of waste management after the Fifth Review Meeting, during the reporting period 2014 – 2016, are assessed in this report. There are currently two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises two VVER- 440 units (Russian type pressurised water reactors), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy (FPH). The Olkiluoto plant comprises two BWR units (boiling water reactors); operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) and a third PWR (pressurized water reactor) unit is under construction. In addition, Fennovoima Oy (Fennovoima) has applied for a construction licence for one pressurised water reactor (AES- 2006) at Pyhäjoki. Spent fuel from the nuclear power plant units is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites for tens of years until disposal. The interim spent fuel storages have already been in operation for about 30 years. The safety of the interim storages was enhanced during the reporting period. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed as planned. The construction licence for the encapsulation and disposal facility was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015 and the construction of the geological disposal facility started in Olkiluoto in December 2016. Fennovoima started the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of its own spent nuclear fuel disposal in summer 2016. Geological disposal facilities for low and intermediate level waste have been in operation since the 1990 s in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. In the future, the Olkiluoto facility is planned to be extended for operational waste from the OL 3 unit and decommissioning waste from all reactor units in Olkiluoto. The disposal facility in Loviisa will be extended for decommissioning waste from the Loviisa NPP units. Fennovoima has planned to build a geological disposal facility for its low and intermediate level waste at the Pyhäjoki site. Major developments in Finland since the 5 th Review Meeting are as follows: there has been real progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal, as well as the enhancement of spent fuel interim storage safety, in addition improvements have been made in NPP’s LILW management and non-nuclear radioactive waste disposal, and there has been significant progress in the planning of the research reactor decommissioning. Furthermore, the legislative and regulatory framework has been enhanced, national competences for future needs have been evaluated and developed, and the IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) was carried out in Finland. Only the main achievements are presented in this summary section. More detailed information on the latest developments in the various topics of the Convention is provided in connection with the relevant articles. Section K summarises the main achievements from the reporting period and also presents Finland’s future challenges in nuclear and radioactive waste management. Since the 5 th Review Meeting The 5 th Review Meeting in 2015 identified challenges, and recorded some planned measures to improve the safety of nuclear waste management in Finland. On request of the Review Meeting these issues and the responsed are included in this 6 th National Report of Finland. The issues are listed here, with the related references provided in brackets. A summary of how Finland has proceeded with the identified challenges during the reporting period is given in Section K. Finland – Challenges • Construction and oversight of the spent fuel (SF) disposal facility (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Decommissioning and waste management of the FiR 1 research reactor (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5) • Ensuring adequate resources and competence in tough economic situations (utilities, waste management organizations, and Government) (Article 20, Article 22) • Communication with public and stakeholders to maintain confidence in safe waste management and regulatory framework (Article 20) • Disposal of a few High-Activity Sealed Sources (HASS), which are not suitable for disposal in existing LILW repositories (Section J). Finland – Planned Measures to Improve Safety • Licensing of the encapsulation plant and the disposal facility for encapsulated spent fuel (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Implementation of recommendations from the IRRS review (Article 20) • Licensing of research reactor decommissioning and start of dismantling activities (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5). The legislative and regulatory system has been enhanced The current Finnish nuclear legislation is based on the Nuclear Energy Act from 1987, together with a supporting Nuclear Energy Decree from 1988. The Nuclear Energy Act has been revised several times over the years. The revision of the Nuclear Energy Act in 2015 enabled STUK to issue legally binding regulations. Based on the Nuclear Energy Act, STUK issued four regulations in 2016 to replace the earlier Government Decrees on nuclear safety for nuclear power plants, the security in the use of nuclear energy, the emergency response arrangements at nuclear power plants, and the disposal of nuclear waste. In addition, one new regulation for the safety of uranium and thorium production was issued. Development of national competences for future needs STUK’s role and responsibilities were assessed in a peer review, as part of the IRRS mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service), in October 2012. In the followup mission in June 2015 the regulatory activities in Finland were reviewed based on the IAEA Safety Standards and international best practices. The main conclusion of the IRRS follow up mission was that STUK had made significant progress in most areas and many improvements had been implemented in accordance with the action plan. The implementation of the recommendations from the “Nuclear Energy Research Strategy”-report from 2013 is on-going by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE). The main aim is to ensure the availability of the competent resources for the safe use of nuclear energy. As an example of the on-going implementation of the recommendations, the Nuclear Energy Act was updated in 2015 to ensure the financing of the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. In addition to the basic training given for the nuclear sciences in universities in Espoo, Helsinki, and Lappeenranta, the availability of competent human resources has also been improved by the additional training of young experts in the nuclear safety field in different ways, e. g. through a networked doctoral programme (YTERA – Doctoral programme for Nuclear Engineering and Radiochemistry in 2012 – 2015) and through separately arranged national courses focusing on nuclear and waste management safety (YK and YJH Courses). Due to the rearrangement of research funding instruments in Finland and additional budget cuts by the Government, STUK has partly terminated and also significantly reduced its radiation safety research. Instead of its own research programme, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will continue in Finland. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed to the construction phase The Finnish nuclear fuel cycle policy is based on the once-through principle. After removal from the reactor spent fuel is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites. After a storage period lasting tens of years, the spent fuel will be disposed of deep in the Finnish bedrock. Posiva submitted construction licence application and supporting safety documentation to the authorities at the end of 2012. STUK’s safety review and assessment was submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in February 2015. The construction licence was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015. The construction of the disposal facility started in December 2016. Posiva is responsible for the preparations for and later on for the implementation of the disposal of spent fuel of its owners TVO and FPH. The disposal project and the granted licence cover spent fuel from five reactors: Loviisa 1 and 2, in addition to Olkiluoto 1, 2 and 3. In the Decision-in-Principle for Fennovoima’s new reactor unit, Fennovoima was required to define its plans for future spent nuclear fuel management and disposal by the end of June 2016. As required, in June 2016 Fennovoima submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment programme for its planned spent fuel disposal activities to the MEAE. Fennovoima and Posiva Solutions Oy (Posiva’s subsidiary that focuses on supplying services) have signed a co-operation agreement to ensure that the expertise of Posiva is available for Fennovoima’s spent nuclear fuel management activities. The co-operation started in 2016. Spent fuel interim storage safety has been enhanced The safety of the spent fuel storages was analysed {{as a part of the}} EU stress tests in relation to the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. Hazards or deficiencies that would have required immediate action were not found, but areas where safety could be further enhanced were identified (e. g. reducing the dependency on nuclear power plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution systems as well as on the sea water cooled systems for residual heat removal of the reactor, containment and spent fuel storage pools, protection against external flooding, seismic resistance of spent fuel pools, and firefighting systems). The spent fuel interim storage facility in Olkiluoto undergone numerous improvements during its capacity extension, which became operational in summer 2015. These included, e. g. protection against large airplane crashes and enabling a cooling water feed from outside the storage area. Based on the evaluation in relation to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, water level and temperature monitoring functions have been improved for earthquake resistance and for the potential loss of the facility power supply. Additionally, the Loviisa spent fuel storage has been improved after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The main changes are aimed at reducing the dependency on the plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution system, as well as on seawater cooled systems for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools. Furthermore, the flood protection of the NPP has been improved. Operation in low and intermediate level waste management proceeded The predisposal management of LILW was developed in Loviisa NPP during the reporting period as the solidification plant was authorized for full operation in 2016. Loviisa NPP has now been able to start the solidification of historical liquid wastes, which had been stored in tanks from the start of NPP’s operation in the late 1970 s. The aim is to solidify and dispose of all existing liquid waste in the forthcoming years. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste has commenced Non-nuclear radioactive wastes originating, e. g. from research, industry and hospitals has been stored in a cavern in the LILW disposal facility at Olkiluoto. The licence conditions of the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility were revised in 2012. The revised license enabled the disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste in the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste started in 2016 and currently most waste accumulated over the years have been disposed of. Planning for decommissioning Finland’s first nuclear reactor has started The research reactor FiR 1 (TRIGA Mark II, 250 kW) has been in operation since 1962. The operation of FiR 1 has been carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. in Espoo since 1971. In 2012, VTT decided to shut down the research reactor due to insufficient funding for its continued operation. The Environmental Impact Assessment procedure for the decommissioning was conducted in 2013 - 2015. FiR 1 will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. VTT submitted an application to the Government for a decommissioning licence on June 20, 2017 (formally this is a new operating licence as the present Finnish legislation does not define a decommissioning licence). The dismantling is scheduled to start in early 2019 and to last about two years. The dismantling will be regulated by STUK concerning the radiation and nuclear safety aspects. Challenges for future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management Finland has identified for itself challenges for the future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management and these are summarized below. Progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal programme has been identified as a continuous challenge because the proceeding project requires the development of regulatory requirements. Moreover, regulatory oversight needs to be developed and adjusted for the different project phases. STUK has procedures in place to review and update plans and regulations as the disposal project proceeds to each new phase and the needs for development are identified. Furthermore, Posiva is well prepared for the construction phase of the disposal project and preparations are ongoing for the forthcoming operation phase. In addition, the development of national competences and a regulatory framework are identified as a continuous challenge because the nuclear field in Finland is very active at the moment and compentent resources are required both for regulatory oversight as well as for licensees and license applicants. Finland has identified following three main challenges for the future work: • Improvement of the national plan for radioactive waste management Finland has a well-functioning system and technical solutions for the management of nuclear waste arising from NPPs and also for major part of non-nuclear radioactive wastes. However, as a consequence of 1) an incident at a sealed radioactive source in the storage facilities in Suomen Nukliditekniikka and its related clean-up work (for more detail information see Section J, article 28), 2) planning of the research reactor decommissioning waste storage and disposal and 3) unresolved challenges of disposal for a few HASS sources, it has been identified that the national radioactive waste management plan and licensing system needs to be evaluated and improved to ensure a national system with capabilities for all possible waste streams. MEAE has invited an ad-hoc expert group to address these issues. The group will also address recommendations made by the Finnish Safety Investigation Authority about the sealed source incident. This group will start its work in autumn 2017. • Developing competences and a regulatory framework for decommissioning The research reactor, FiR 1, will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. As this is the first decommissioning project, Finland has limited experience in this area. VTT and STUK are both co-operating internationally gathering knowledge and experience about the implementation and regulation of decommissioning. The decommissioning project of the research reactor is also a very important learning process for STUK as the experiences gained will be used in updating regulations and YVL guides and also later on in planning the regulatory oversight for the decommissioning of NPPs. • Communication to improve general public’s understanding of disposal safety The Finnish public has a high degree of trust in the radiation and nuclear safety regulator, STUK, and there is a good degree of trust towards the safety of nuclear waste management and disposal. However, the interest of the general public towards disposal seems to be declining. Additionally, the latest poll results (conducted by e. g. Finnish Energy in 2016) show indications of a slight decrease in trust towards thesafety of nuclear waste disposal. Developments of these trends need to be followed in forthcoming polls. The regulatory work and decisions made by the regulator have to be clear and understandable to the general public. The general public should also have the correct understanding of disposal safety and related risks. Due to these challenges, STUK, for its part, initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both the changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. Candidate for good practice Finland has identified that the granting of the construction licence for a spent fuel disposal facility is a candidate for good practice. Finland is the first country that has granted a construction licence for a final repository for spent fuel. Construction of the facility is ongoing. The development and evaluation of safe disposal has been a long-lasting systematic process involving conducted in good co-operation with the Government, ministries, regulators, Posiva, nuclear power companies as well as research organisations while acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of the different parties. The approach taken in Finland has enabled timely progress of the disposal project with political and public support and resulted in approval of the construction licencelicence application in 2015. This is a concrete step towards improving safety in a unique and proven manner. Conclusion In conclusion, based on the information presented in the report, Finland complies with the obligations and objectives of the Joint Convention. Challenges for the future have been recognized, regularly reviewed and addressed. The required efforts for continuous improvement have been made...|$|E

SIMPATICO addresses a strategic challenge towards the innovation and modernization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public sector: the need to offer a more efficient and more effective experience to companies and citizens in their daily interaction with Public Administration (PA) by: (i) offering a personalized delivery of PA online services; (ii) enabling a better comprehension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex processes and documents (forms, regulations, etc.) behind these services; (iii) engaging citizens to improve the administration processes and services. Several ethical and data protection aspects should be taken into account due <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> public/private stakeholders and citizens and due to the necessity to collect, store and process personal data. Starting from a brief illustration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SIMPATICO project, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ethical concerns raised by the project activities, this report describes the procedures adopted to ensure compliance with ethical requirements.

40|$|Global {{staffing}} {{has remained}} a main focus within <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> International Human Resource Management (IHRM) since the 1970 s (Collings, Scullion and Morley, 2007). With <b>the</b> changing patterns <b>of</b> global staffing in multinational enterprises, the latest trend has seen a decline in traditional international posts, and a rise in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> self-initiated expatriates (SIEs), with Asian countries being the emerging popular migration destinations (Collings et al., 2007; OECD, 2012). In recent years, scholars have presented <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> treating organisational expatriates (OEs) and SIEs as heterogeneous groups (Altman and Baruch, 2012; Guzzo, Noonon, & Elron, 1994). OEs are defined as expatriates whom are sent to international assignments by their home employers, whereas SIEs are those who {{make their own decisions}} to work and live in a foreign country (Doherty et al., 2013). SIEs have become a larger segment relative to OEs in global labour market (Myers and Pringle, 2005). Indeed, multi-National Corporations (MNCs) have indicated an intention to replace OE managers with local-hired SIEs (Collings et al., 2007). With the increased reliance on SIEs relative to OEs in organisations, it is important to acknowledge that the drivers and motivations of SIEs might differ, as well as their perceptions towards the Psychological Contract (PC). In the present study, we adopt the definition by Rousseau (1989, p. 123) whereby the PC refers to the employee’s beliefs “regarding the terms and conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between that focal person and another party”. Given the protean career attitudes of SIEs, which are described as a self-driven and value-oriented towards career advancement (Bricoe et al., 2006), it might result in substantial differences for SIEs in their expectation of their employer and understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived promises relative to OEs. Moreover, previous studies have indicated various (perceived) differences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two groups, e. g. motives, interaction with locals, work adjustment and career advancement opportunities, international mobility patterns (Alshahrani and Morley, 2015; Altman and Baruch, 2012; Guzzo, Noonon, & Elron, 1994). These factors may also {{have a significant impact on}} the differences in how SIEs experience <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employer’s <b>obligations,</b> and their emotional reactions to perceived failed promises made by the employer...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{psychological}} contract {{has received}} increasing {{attention in the}} organizational behaviour literature. It {{can be defined as}} an individual's beliefs regarding the terms and conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between himself/herself and another party. Existing research has primarily focused on exploring how employees respond to perceived employer psychological contract breach. Limited {{attention has been paid to}} <b>the</b> norm <b>of</b> reciprocity as <b>the</b> underlying exchange mechanism, to contract formation and maintenance, and to the employer's perspective on the exchange. Using quantitative methodology, this thesis drew upon two separate samples of employees and one sample of employer representatives from two knowledge intensive Finnish organizations, comprising 109, 162 and 45 respondents respectively. A qualitative interview study of 15 employees <b>of</b> one <b>the</b> participating organizations complemented the quantitative studies. <b>The</b> specific aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis were 1) to examine different reciprocity forms from both employee and employer perspectives in terms of their antecedents and outcomes; and 2) to extend existing knowledge on how the psychological contract functions as a schema and how the employees see <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> reciprocity in their exchange relationship with their employer in an event of perceived contract breach. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantitative study indicated from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employee that perceived contract fulfilment by the employer influenced employees' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> reciprocity underlying <b>the</b> exchange relationship. Trust played a mediating role in affecting these relationships. With regard to behavioural outcomes, <b>the</b> different forms <b>of</b> reciprocity had different associations with the employees' attitudes and behaviours measured, but did not influence employees' <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> psychological contract <b>obligations.</b> From <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employer, managers' perceptions <b>of</b> employees' <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract <b>obligations</b> were positively associated with their perceptions of their own <b>obligations</b> and <b>the</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> these <b>obligations.</b> Similarly, perceptions of an organizational reciprocity norm were found to have a significant effect on managers' perceptions of their obligations to employees. Relationship reciprocity orientation in the manager-employee exchange played a mediating role in these associations. The qualitative study in turn found that employees' responses to contract breach depended on their sense-making process. Employees' interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breach influenced the extent to which the breach threatened the overall psychological contract schema and the employees' adherence to <b>the</b> norm <b>of</b> reciprocity. <b>The</b> contributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis, its main research and practical implications, and future research directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Public {{accountability}} and transparency represent a relevant topic debated {{both at the}} political, media and academic levels (Boyce, 2014). New public management reforms were also aimed at making public sector organisations more accountable to the stakeholders, and citizens first (Jacobs, 2016). The austerity policies are pushing public sector organisations to reinvent <b>the</b> mode <b>of</b> delivery with <b>the</b> increase use <b>of</b> hybrid forms, such as public-private-partnerships and co-production (Bracci, Fugini, & Sicilia, 2016). In such context, public accountability is becoming even more blurred and difficult {{to be brought to}} the users (Hyndman & Lapsley, 2016). Accrual accounting, performance measurement, financial reporting, non-financial reporting, all of these represent examples of changes also aimed at improving <b>the</b> accountability <b>of</b> public sector organisations, or more in general of public service organisations (Broadbent & Guthrie, 2008). Despite the innovation toward the harmonization and improvement of public sector accounting, traditional financial reporting is not considered to be capable <b>of</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> accountability <b>obligations</b> with regards to the wider non-expert citizenry. At the same time, public sector organizations are increasingly required to be more transparent, providing an increasing amount of data through their website. Although, transparency is an important value to increase the possibility for a social control by the citizens, and reducing <b>the</b> diffusion <b>of</b> frauds and corruption, it does not guarantee <b>the</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accountability <b>obligations.</b> Indeed, while transparency can be considered a pre-requisite <b>of</b> accountability, <b>the</b> latter requires <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a set <b>of</b> action and <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> specific accountability medium. To this respect, we observed, both in practice and into the academic debate an increasing discussion and presentation of alternative reporting tools. The latter intended to overcome <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial reporting. In particular, social reporting, popular reporting and integrated reporting are three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most known, diffused and debated reporting medium. With some exceptions (Cohen & Karatzimas, 2015), the above reporting tools have been studied in isolation, focusing on their role, diffusions, implications and effects. In this paper, we aim to provide a comparative analysis of three public accountability tools, namely social reporting, popular financial reporting, and integrated reporting. After a separate analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three reporting tools, the paper carries out an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> similarities, differences among them and possible reflections on their development. In particular, we will speculate about the practical and research implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> these forms of reporting practice in the public sector. We draw from the accountability literature and from the literature on management innovation diffusion (Abrahamson, 1991), in order to give some preliminary hints about <b>the</b> different level <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reporting tools. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper is structured in the following fashion. Section 2 will provide an introductory analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing call for transparency, {{accountability and}} additional forms of reporting with respect to the traditional financial one. Section 3 will briefly explain <b>the</b> methodology <b>of</b> analysis, while section 4 will present <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social reporting, popular reporting and integrated reporting.

60|$|That {{first of}} {{judicial}} virtues, impartiality, is an obligation of justice, partly {{for the reason}} last mentioned; as being a necessary condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. But this is not <b>the</b> only source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exalted rank, among human obligations, of those maxims of equality and impartiality, which, both in popular estimation and in that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most enlightened, are included among <b>the</b> precepts <b>of</b> justice. In one point of view, they may be considered as corollaries from the principles already laid down. If it is a duty to do to each according to his deserts, returning good for good as well as repressing evil by evil, it necessarily follows that we should treat all equally well (when no higher duty forbids) who have deserved equally well of us, and that society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice; towards which all institutions, and <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> all virtuous citizens, should {{be made in the}} utmost possible degree to converge. But this great moral duty rests upon a still deeper foundation, being a direct emanation from <b>the</b> first principle <b>of</b> morals, and not a mere logical corollary from secondary or derivative doctrines. It is involved in <b>the</b> very meaning <b>of</b> Utility, or <b>the</b> Greatest-Happiness Principle. That principle is a mere form of words without rational signification, unless one person's happiness, supposed equal in degree (with the proper allowance made for kind), is counted for exactly as much as another's. Those conditions being supplied, Bentham's dictum, 'everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one,' might be written under <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> utility as an explanatory commentary.[D] <b>The</b> equal claim <b>of</b> everybody to happiness in <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moralist and the legislator, involves an equal claim to all <b>the</b> means <b>of</b> happiness, except in so far as <b>the</b> inevitable conditions <b>of</b> human life, and the general interest, in which that of every individual is included, set limits to the maxim; and those limits ought to be strictly construed. As every other maxim of justice, so this, is by no means applied or held applicable universally; on the contrary, as I have already remarked, it bends to every person's ideas of social expediency. But in whatever case it is deemed applicable at all, it is held to be <b>the</b> dictate <b>of</b> justice. All persons are deemed to have a right to equality of treatment, except when some recognised social expediency requires the reverse. And hence all social inequalities which have ceased to be considered expedient, assume <b>the</b> character not <b>of</b> simple inexpediency, but of injustice, and appear so tyrannical, that people are apt to wonder how they ever could have been tolerated; forgetful that they themselves perhaps tolerate other inequalities under an equally mistaken notion <b>of</b> expediency, <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> which would make that which they approve seem quite as monstrous as what they have at last learnt to condemn. <b>The</b> entire history <b>of</b> social improvement has been a series of transitions, by which one custom or institution after another, from being a supposed primary necessity of social existence, has passed into <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> an universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it has been with <b>the</b> distinctions <b>of</b> slaves and freemen, nobles and serfs, patricians and plebeians; and so it will be, and in part already is, with <b>the</b> aristocracies <b>of</b> colour, race, and sex.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the character and}} development of clerical social criticism in England between c. 1540 and c. 1640. It draws principally {{on a number of}} sermons and treatises that offered critiques <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing structures <b>of</b> wealth and power or exhortations to <b>the</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> charitable <b>obligation.</b> <b>The</b> paradigm through which these texts were constructed was that of ‘complaint’, a genre that was particularly vibrant in medieval discourse and in the sermons and ‘commonwealth’ tracts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1540 s. It will be argued that rather than eschewing this tradition, late sixteenth-century preachers appropriated and refashioned its structures, themes and authorial positioning in response to far reaching economic, social and religious change. Particular aspects of socio-economic change, and of their effects on the clergy in particular, are examined in the introduction. Among the themes that are particularly germane to this thesis are <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enclosure movement; increasing commercialisation; and changing attitudes towards the poor. The first chapter assembles a number of printed texts in order to re-examine <b>the</b> trajectory <b>of</b> clerical complaint literature in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> these developments. <b>The</b> second chapter {{considers the}} potential for social and political criticism in sermons preached at the county assizes, a sub-genre of ‘occasional’ sermons that until recently has received little attention from literary scholars or historians. <b>The</b> latter half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis offers three case studies of selected sermons by three different authors. <b>The</b> intention <b>of</b> these chapters is primarily to examine the interaction between a text and its particular local context, although attention is also paid to broader social, political and discursive developments that help shed light on <b>the</b> historical meaning <b>of</b> these sermons. It is thus hoped that this study will contribute particularly to the ongoing interdisciplinary work <b>of</b> ‘contextualising’ <b>the</b> early modern English sermon and <b>of</b> reconstructing <b>the</b> role and status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parish minister. Rather than a ‘voice in the wilderness’, it is concluded, the clerical moralist was an active agent in <b>the</b> discursive interpretation <b>of</b> economic change, and in the fashioning and communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reputation <b>of</b> powerful individuals.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{incorporation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Convention on <b>the</b> Elimination <b>of</b> All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) {{into the}} Human Rights Act, and transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rome Statute into the Norwegian Penal Code of 2005 (NPC) has actualized <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> international tendencies in regard <b>of</b> positive <b>obligations</b> under <b>the</b> Conventions to penalise any non-consensual activity as rape. Failure {{to comply with}} these international obligations provides different outcomes for the Member State Parties. At the present, <b>the</b> current definition <b>of</b> rape in Section 192 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Civil Penal Code of 1902 (GCPC) is in conflict with <b>the</b> international <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> Norway, as it does not penalise non-consensual sexual activity as rape. The ECtHR stated in M. C v. Bulgaria that the Member State Parties have a positive obligation to penalise any non-consensual sexual act cf. Articles 3 and 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ECHR. Failure to comply with this obligation may give rise to damage liability for <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Norway towards individuals subject to non-consensual sexual activity. <b>The</b> Committee <b>of</b> CEDAW urged Norway in its Eight Periodic Report of Norway to: Adopt a legal definition <b>of</b> rape in <b>the</b> Penal Code so as to place <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> consent at its centre, {{in line with the}} Commit-tee&acute;s general recommendation No. 19, and the Vertido case. In <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> relevant domestic statutory law and case law, this recommendation can be interpreted as a specific provision under CEDAW and thus a positive obligation for Norway to undertake. Failure to comply with this ob-ligation might contribute to continued discrimination of women in law and practice. The Rome Statute was transformed into the Norwegian Penal Code (NPC) of 2005 chapter 16 penalising rape as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Rape is not specifically defined, but the prepara-tory works held that the specified provisions were to be interpreted in <b>the</b> light <b>of,</b> and in accord-ance with <b>the</b> international <b>obligation.</b> <b>The</b> definition <b>of</b> rape as a war crime and as a crime against humanity is at the present unresolved. There are currently pending cases before the Inter-national Criminal Court expected to bring clarity as to how rape is defined in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rome Statute. During the late 1990 &acute;s and beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21 st century, three definitions of rape were issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Current trends of international law seem to favour <b>the</b> non-consensual definition <b>of</b> rape held by the ICTY in the Kunarac case. The object and purpose <b>of</b> transforming <b>the</b> Rome Statute into chapter 16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NPC was to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity under Norwegian jurisdiction. Failure to revise or expand <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> rape in <b>the</b> GCPC might prevent Norwegian Courts from convicting people accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes, contrary to the object and purpose of chapter 16 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NPC. The situation with two different definitions of rape in Norwegian Criminal Statutes may be considered unsatisfactory. Even if there were no conceptual or systemic arguments decisively against maintaining this dual system, the International criminal solution may provide additional policy arguments in favour of redefining rape in the domestic Penal Code. The Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) confirms the international trend towards regarding lack <b>of</b> consent as <b>the</b> constituent element <b>of</b> rape. Case law, and reports from <b>the</b> ECtHR, Committee <b>of</b> CEDAW, ICTY, ICTR and ICC shows that these supranational organs refer to one another in deciding <b>the</b> common denominator <b>of</b> rape. <b>The</b> Constitution <b>of</b> Norway and <b>the</b> Supreme Court&acute;s strict practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> legality limit <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate affect <b>of</b> International <b>Obligations</b> in <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> crimi-nal law, in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused. <b>Fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Obligations</b> <b>of</b> Norway is thus based on <b>the</b> consensus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State...|$|R
