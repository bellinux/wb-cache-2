25|$|John Bonham {{played the}} drums {{like someone who}} didn't {{know what was going}} to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff. No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> forever be the {{greatest}} drummer of all time.|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E
6000|$|... "I told Tippy Tilly that, if {{he could}} help us, we would turn him into a Bimbashi when we got him back into Egypt. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>willing</b> enough if <b>he</b> only had the power. By Jove, Belmont, do {{look back at the}} river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Burge trusts almost {{everything}} to you now, Adam, doesn't <b>he?</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make you his partner soon. <b>He</b> <b>will,</b> if <b>he's</b> wise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know! But {{even if he}} did, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will,</b> <b>I</b> won't have Valetta {{waiting for}} his {{decision}} and admitted on sufferance.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Early in his pro career, Mayweather {{received}} {{praise from}} {{all corners of}} the boxing world and was touted as a pugilistic prodigy. During his fight with Tony Duran the ESPN commentator remarked, [...] "Emmanuel Steward was quoted as saying there have been very few who have been more talented than this kid. He will probably win two or three world championships; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> go on to be the best ever". IBHOF trainer and commentator Gil Clancy commented before Mayweather's ninth professional fight (against Jesus Chavez), [...] "I thought that Floyd Mayweather was the outstanding pro prospect in the entire Olympic games".|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{exit from}} the Senate {{at the end of}} 1996, Nunn was the {{recipient}} of bipartisan praise from his colleagues. Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia concluded, [...] "Senator Nunn quickly established himself as one of the leading experts in the Congress and, indeed, all of the United States on national security and foreign policy. He gained a reputation in our country and, indeed, worldwide as a global thinker, and that is where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> make his greatest contribution in the years to come, wherever he may be, in terms of being a global thinker. His approach to national security issues has been guided by one fundamental criteria: What Sam Nunn believes {{is in the best interest}} of the United States of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace's reaction, {{delivered}} in January 1859, {{was that he}} was gratified to have spurred Darwin into making the announcement and that it would have caused him [...] "much pain & regret" [...] if his papers had been published on their own, without Darwin's papers. [...] Darwin was still sensitive on the point, and assured Wallace that he [...] "had absolutely nothing whatever to do with leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought was a fair course of action". He responded to Wallace's enquiry about what Lyell thought of the theory by saying that [...] "I think he is somewhat staggered, but does not give in and speaks with horror [...] what a job it would be for the next edition of [...] "The Principles" [...] if he were [...] "perverted". But he is most candid and honest, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> end up by being [...] "perverted"." [...] Lyell was still struggling {{to come to terms with}} the idea of mankind, with immortal soul, originating from animals, but [...] "Considering his age, his former views and position in society, I think his conduct has been heroic on the subject." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Crabtree is in jail, so {{you will}} only have Dan Baxter to guard against," [...] said Dick. [...] "And <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> show up in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember me to him," [...] he said. [...] "And {{tell him}} I {{thank him for}} all those years of love and gentleness. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can {{interpret}} if Mr. Merton is puzzled, Mrs. Bower, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{understand better}} {{if we go to}} the laird's chamber.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, let her and Emma {{know that}} I am {{sure it is}} not their fault. Come again to-morrow, please; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} will! But if he did--No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> be a staff to guide a silly, priggish heart to the deeper wisdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Lignum. No. I don't say <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> But if <b>he</b> {{could get}} over this money trouble of his, I believe he would be off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Black Heart still sleeps," [...] {{the voice}} said, [...] "but there is colour in his face; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> wake soon, and find his {{thoughts}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I hope not. He {{ought not}} to do so, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> But Mark says that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> ask him to dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what he does}} mean. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> do that always. He's {{what people}} call imperious; but that isn't bad in a man, is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] he answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> soon be {{satisfied}} with regarding his stone likeness, and then he will go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Always; but of late I find a {{great change}} in him. I cannot {{discover}} {{what is the}} matter with him. He has grown melancholy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not live.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'JAN. 15TH, 1875. - Frewen contemplates {{suspending}} soap bubbles by silk threads {{for experimental}} purposes. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> manage that. Bernard' [the youngest] 'volunteered {{to blow the}} bubbles with enthusiasm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hitherto he {{has been}} faithful," [...] said the Doctor, [...] "and <b>I</b> scarce <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> fail me now. But Joceline will go down and have the horses in {{readiness}} in the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{a little}} {{weak in the}} head, I think," [...] said Prudence, in a clear voice. [...] "He was very frightened after you had gone; <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> trouble us again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then good night, monsieur. May {{the good}} God bless you and aid you to-morrow, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will!</b> I do {{think you are}} the bravest man I ever met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a smitch. I reckon he {{got scared}} {{when he saw}} you talkin' to that {{policeman}} yesterday, an' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> give us a wide berth for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I shall do well enough--there'll be Neb; {{and as for}} Rupert, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{be better}} {{satisfied}} ashore than at sea. Rupert {{is a sort of}} a natural lawyer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am sorry—and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{know what}} you mean,” {{she said as she}} handed it him. “If my father is in Cuba now—and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is—he <b>will</b> tell you just what to do.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say 'father.' We {{never called}} him papa; {{and if one}} of my {{brothers}} had addressed him as 'governor,' as boys do now, <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>'d</b> have him cut off with a shilling." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{the spirit}} of the age will allow {{immortality}} to any man of these days, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> But I doubt whether public opinion, as now existing, will admit of hero-worship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you've succeeded so far," [...] Mr. Fentolin remarked. [...] "Here he is, {{and here}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> stay until some days after your friend from Scotland Yard can get here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At first,' said Mark; 'but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> {{give way}} {{when he has}} had {{time to look at}} the matter, and sees how good you are. That will make all the difference.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How do {{you know}} till I've made it?' asked the rebel. 'I shall ask Lord Nidderdale to second it, and when he has heard it <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not refuse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{business}} is with Mr. Paul de Vaux," [...] I said. [...] "Will {{you tell him}} that it is some one from the Hermitage, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{all ready}} to make up if you don't say much, for he owned to me he was wrong; but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> own it to you, in words," [...] began Rose.|$|R
