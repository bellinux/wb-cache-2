The {{investigation into the}} collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|Columbia is {{the county}} seat of Boone County, and houses the county court and {{government}} center. The city is located in Missouri's 4th congressional district. The 19th Missouri State Senate district covers all of Boone County. There are five Missouri House of Representatives districts (9, 21, 23, 24, 25) in the city. The principal law enforcement agency is the Columbia Police Department, with the Columbia Fire Department providing <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> The University of Missouri Police Department patrols areas on and around the MU campus and has jurisdiction throughout the city and Boone County. The Public Service Joint Communications Center coordinates efforts between the two organizations {{as well as the}} Boone County <b>Fire</b> <b>Protection</b> District which operates Urban Search and Rescue Missouri Task Force 1.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{reduction of}} risk in LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) road transport due {{to the adoption of}} passive <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> was investigated. Experimental data available for small scale vessels fully engulfed by a fire were extended to real scale road and rail tankers through a finite elements model. The results of mathematical simulations of real scale fire engulfment scenarios that may follow accidents involving LPG tankers proved the effectiveness of the thermal protections in preventing the "fired" BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) scenario. The presence of a thermal coating greatly increases the "time to failure", providing a time lapse that in the European experience may be considered sufficient to allow the start of effective mitigation actions by fire brigades. The results obtained were used to calculate the expected reduction of individual and societal risk due to LPG transportation in real case scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the introduction of passive <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> turns out in a significant {{reduction of risk}}, up to an order of magnitude in the case of individual risk and of about 50 % if the expectation value is considered. Thus, the adoption of passive <b>fire</b> <b>protections,</b> not compulsory in European regulations, may be an effective technical measure for risk reduction, and may contribute to achieve the control of "major accidents hazards" cited by the European legislation. © 2009 Elsevier B.

5|$|Although it is {{situated}} in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{cooperation}} between {{federal and state}} agencies {{on a national level}} has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 <b>fires,</b> <b>protection</b> of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|R

5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. <b>Fire</b> <b>protection</b> equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{assessment}} of fireproofing materials performance is addressed. A methodology based on a combined experimental and numerical approach is presented and applied for characterizing the fireproofing behavior of a novel inorganic formulation based on basalt fibers and silica aerogel. A {{modified version of the}} ASTM E 162 standard fire test was used to expose specimens of fireproofed steel board to a steady radiation source. Experimental results were used to validate a simplified mono-dimensional model which allowed simulating more severe conditions and different protection configurations. A specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI) was evaluated in order to support the effective design of passive <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> and to compare the performance of manufactured products against that of commercial fireproofing materials...|$|R
