System air-conditioner is an air-conditioning system with multiple <b>indoor</b> <b>units.</b> Due {{to the complexity of}} the system, it is more difficult to detect the refrigerant amount charged in system air-conditioner than in a general single air-conditioner. Experiments were performed for 6 HP outdoor <b>units</b> with 3 <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> in a psychrometric calorimeter. The experimental amount of charged refrigerant was ranged from 60 % to 140 % with 10 % increase. Fuzzy algorithm was employed for detecting the charged refrigerant amount in a system air-conditioner.

40|$|The {{development}} of a physics-based dynamic model of a three-evaporator air conditioning (TEAC) system is reported. The TEAC model was built on sub-models of major system components in the TEAC system, including a compressor, an air-cooled condenser, three electronic expansion valves, three <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> and <b>indoor</b> spaces. Unlike all other reported TEAC models, the TEAC model developed specifically took into account both sensible and latent heat balances on the airside of all <b>indoor</b> <b>units.</b> The TEAC model was validated using a purpose-built TEAC experimental rig.

40|$|With {{increased}} use of air source heat pumps, a possible barrier for further market growth and customer acceptance is their noise level.

This knowledge is then to be used in continued work when describing the total disturbance of a heat pump. Two heat pumps, both of inverter type and with different noise performance were selected for measurements. Energy performance, in the form of Coefficient of Performance (COP), was evaluated at different operating conditions. Measurements of the sound power level were performed on both the outdoor and the <b>indoor</b> <b>units.</b> Results show that the sound level from the <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> is independent of the outdoor conditions.

But these camouflaged units appeared to be prototypes with no certain criterion insisting the presence of the camouflage as a real aspect in the era, which can solve many problems in the indoor space especially when it refers to the eco efficiency.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to packaged systems {{is the use}} of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems. These systems, although most often seen in residential applications, are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings. The evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the <b>indoor</b> <b>unit</b> to vents or diffusers around the rooms.|$|E

40|$|Using a multi-evaporator air {{conditioning}} (MEAC) system to correctly control indoor air temperatures {{only in a}} multi-room application is already a challenging and difficult task, let alone the control of both indoor air temperature and humidity. This is because in an MEAC system, a number of <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> are connected to a common condensing unit. Hence, the interferences among operation parameters of different <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> would make the desired control of an MEAC system hard to realize. Limited capacity control algorithms for MEAC systems have been developed, with most of them focusing only on the control of indoor air temperature, and no previous studies involving control of indoor air humidity using MEAC systems can be identified. In this paper, {{the development of a}} novel capacity controller for a three-evaporator {{air conditioning}} (TEAC) system for improved indoor air humidity control is reported. The novel controller was developed by integrating two previous control algorithms for a dual-evaporator air conditioning system for temperature control and for a single-evaporator air conditioning system for improved indoor humidity control. Experimental controllability tests were carried out and the controllability test results showed that, with the novel controller, improved control over indoor humidity levels and better energy efficiency for a TEAC system could be obtained as compared to the traditional On-Off controllers extensively used by MEAC systems.

Heat recovery VRF technology allows individual <b>indoor</b> <b>units</b> to heat or cool as required, while the compressor load benefits from the internal heat recovery.
