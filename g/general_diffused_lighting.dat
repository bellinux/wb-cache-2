40|$|Light is not evenly {{distributed}} in Dutch glass greenhouses, but {{this can be}} improved with <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Modern greenhouse coverings are able to transform most of the light entering the greenhouse into <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture has studied the effect of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> on crops for several years. Modelling and experimental studies showed that crops such as fruit vegetables with a high plant canopy as well as ornamentals with a small plant canopy can utilize <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> better than direct <b>light.</b> <b>Diffuse</b> <b>light</b> penetrates the middle layers of a high-grown crop and results in a better horizontal light distribution in the greenhouse. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is absorbed to a better degree by the middle leaf layers of cucumber, resulting in a higher photosynthesis. The actual photosynthesis of four pot plant species {{was found to be}} increased and crop temperatures were lower during high irradiation. The yield of cucumbers was increased, and the growth rate of several potted plants was increased.

Cycocel favoured germination in total darkness and largely inhibited it in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> The growth of radicule and hypocotyl was promoted only in total darkness. Gibberellic acid accelerated {{the pace of}} germination in total darkness more than <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> in the firs 24 hours. The growth of the radicule {{as well as the}} hypocotyl was more in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> whereas only the radicule indicated an enhanced growth in total darkness in low concentration. The known influence of this chemical on the shoot elongation largely remained ineffective. In kinetin cent percent germination was obtained in total darkness which was not so in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> except for high concentration. It enhanced the pace of germination in total darkness in the first 24 hors. The seedling growth was promoted in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> while it was inhibited in total darkness. The increase {{in the size of the}} cotyledons took place only in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> It became apparent that kinetin and gibberellic acid could partly substitute the requirements of total darkness for seed germination in this species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Photosynthetically active solar {{radiation}} {{can be either}} direct or diffuse. Due to atmospheric scattering, {{solar radiation}} is never fully direct. Under heavy overcast conditions however, it can be fully diffuse. Screens and glass that transform direct <b>light</b> into <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> are used {{under the assumption that}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is more evenly distributed over the canopy, increasing crop photosynthesis rate. The Intkam crop growth model computes leaf photosynthesis rate in 5 leaf layers, for the sunlit and shaded leaf area and for the leaf areas receiving direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> It integrates instantaneous leaf photosynthesis rates to the crop photosynthesis rate. Instantaneous canopy photosynthesis is used to compute the seasonal growth of organs. This process approach enables a detailed analysis of the effects of variations in natural light. An analytical comparison was made between 100 % direct and 100 % <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> for a representative day in winter (day 24) and in summer (day 202). Sunlit leaf area is illuminated by both direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> whereas a shaded leaf area is illuminated by <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> only. These components vary within and among leaf layers, and were all quantified. On both days, a higher instantaneous crop photosynthesis was computed under fully <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> than under fully direct light. This difference is caused by the more homogeneous distribution of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> than direct light at a certain canopy depth, in combination with a declining response to increasing light intensities of the photosynthesis rate. Experiments with three types of diffuse glass and a whitewash were conducted in 2011. Light scattering of the glass (haze) varied from 45 - 71 %, with at least the same transmission as the reference. Tomato production under diffuse glass was increased by 8 - 11 % in early June, and was maintained to November. The Intkam model simulated approximately the same relative seasonal production increases under diffuse glass...|$|R
40|$|We {{search for}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> {{in the galaxy}} group HCG 44 in order to {{determine}} its luminosity and luminosity fraction. Combining with literature data, we aim to constrain the dynamical status of Hickson compact groups. We use Intra Group planetary nebulae (IGPNe) as tracers of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> These are detected by the so-called on band-off band technique. We found 12 emission line objects in HCG 44, none of them associated with the galaxies of the group. The absence of PNe in the elliptical galaxy, NGC 3193, implies that this galaxy is located behind the group, leaving only three spiral galaxy members in HCG 44. 6 / 12 emission line objects are consistent with being IGPNe in HCG 44, but are also consistent with being Lyα background galaxies. Thus we derive an upper limit to the <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fraction in HCG 44 of 4. 7 %, corresponding to 1. 06 × 10 9 L⊙,B and mean surface brightness ofµB = 30. 04 mag arcsec − 2. We find a correlation between the fraction of elliptical galaxies and the amount of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> in Hickson compact groups. Those with large fraction of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> are those with large fractions in number and luminosity of E/S 0 galaxies. This indicates that the <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is mainly created in dynamical processes during the formation of bright elliptical galaxies in major mergers. We propose an evolutionary sequence for Hickson compact groups in which the amount of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> increases with the dynamical evolution of the group. Key words.

40|$|The light {{environment}} of plants is extremely complex and questions relating to how direct, <b>diffuse,</b> or low-angle <b>light</b> affect plants at the leaf-level have remained largely unanswered. Global-change scenarios suggest a trend of increasing <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> due to expected increases in cloud cover and atmospheric water vapor concentrations. Here we present three different examples where {{changes in the}} directional quality of light affect leaf-level processes. First, some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which {{have been shown to}} focus collimated light, but their optical function under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> has been largely speculative. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat and lens-shaped epidermal cells. Regardless of epidermal cell shape, direct light was absorbed more than <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> in all species studied by approximately 2 – 3 %. These data suggest that lensshaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> and palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape. Second, community-level productivity has been shown to increase under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> conditions and has been attributed to more uniform distribution of light within the forest canopy. Leaf-level responses to the directional quality of light, however, are unknown. Here we show that leaf-level photosynthesis in sun leaves of both C 3 and C 4 plants can be 10 – 15 % higher under direct light compared to equivalent absorbed irradiances of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> while shade-adapted leaves showed no preference for direct or <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> at any irradiance. Sun leaves with multiple palisade layers may be adapted to better utilize direct than <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> while shade leaf structure does not appear to discriminate light based on its directionality. Thus, it appears that leaf-level and canopy-level photosynthetic processes react differently to the directionality of light, and previously observed increases in canopy-level photosynthesis occur even though leaf-level photosynthesis decreases under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Third, we tested how changes in the directional quality of light affect the penetration of light at the leaf-level. Using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging we were able to determine that low-angle and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> do not penetrate as deeply into leaves as direct light. Upon entering the leaf, <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> appears to scatter and remain in the upper tissue layers, while direct light penetrates through more leaf tissue. Absorption of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is reduced compared to direct light, with the greatest differences in absorption occurring near the interface of the palisade and spongy mesophyll tissue. Changes in the directional quality of light can therefore alter the absorption of light at the leaf-level, and a shift in the absorption profile could potentially decrease light utilization, potentially contributing to the leaf-level photosynthetic differences observed. Overall, {{it is now clear that}} plants are much more sensitive to the directional quality of light than we once believed. Also, the directional quality of light has different effects when scaling from the leaf to the landscape, and models of both leaf-level and community-level photosynthesis should be revised to account for these new findings...|$|R

40|$|A layered canopy {{model was}} {{used to analyze the}} effects of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> on canopy gross {{photosynthesis}} in controlled environment plant growth chambers, where, in contrast to the field, highly <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> can occur at high irradiance. The model suggests that high <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fractions (approximately 0. 7) and irradiance (1400 micromoles m- 2 s- 1) may enhance crop life-cycle canopy gross photosynthesis for hydroponic wheat by about 20 % compared to direct light at the same irradiance. Our simulations suggest that high accuracy is not needed in specifying <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fractions in chambers between approximately 0. 7 and 1, because simulated photosynthesis for closed canopies plateau in this range. We also examined the effect of leaf angle distribution on canopy photosynthesis under growth chamber conditions, as these distributions determine canopy extinction coefficients for direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> We show that the spherical leaf angle distribution is not suitable for modeling photosynthesis of planophile canopies (e. g., soybean and peanut) in growth chambers. Also, the absorption of the light reflected from the surface below the canopy should generally be included in model simulations, as the corresponding albedo values in the photosynthetically active range may be quite high in growth chambers (e. g., approximately 0. 5). In addition to the modeling implications, our results suggest that <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> conditions should be considered when drawing conclusions from experiments in controlled environments...|$|R

40|$|Plants use <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> more {{efficiently}} than direct light. However, experimental comparisons between <b>diffuse</b> and direct <b>light</b> have been obscured by co-occurring differences in environmental conditions (e. g. light intensity). This study aims to analyse the {{factors that contribute to}} an increase in crop photosynthesis in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> and to quantify their relative contribution under different levels of diffuseness at similar light intensities. The hypothesis is that the enhancement of crop photosynthesis in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> results not only from the direct effects of more uniform vertical and horizontal light distribution in the crop canopy, but also from crop physiological and morphological acclimation. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops were grown in three greenhouse compartments that were covered by glass with different degrees of light diffuseness (0, 45 and 71 % of the direct light being converted into <b>diffuse</b> <b>light)</b> while maintaining similar light transmission. Measurements of horizontal and vertical photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution in the crop, leaf photosynthesis light response curves and leaf area index (LAI) were used to quantify each factor's contribution to an increase in crop photosynthesis in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> In addition, leaf temperature, photoinhibition, and leaf biochemical and anatomical properties were studied. The highest degree of light diffuseness (71 %) increased the calculated crop photosynthesis by 7 center dot 2 %. This effect was mainly attributed to a more uniform horizontal (33 % of the total effect) and vertical PPFD distribution (21 %) in the crop. In addition, plants acclimated to the high level of diffuseness by gaining a higher photosynthetic capacity of leaves {{in the middle of the}} crop and a higher LAI, which contributed 23 and 13 %, respectively, to the total increase in crop photosynthesis in <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Moreover, <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> resulted in lower leaf temperatures and less photoinhibition at the top of the canopy when global irradiance was high. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>light</b> enhanced crop photosynthesis.

We predict that the stellar mass fraction in <b>diffuse,</b> intrahalo <b>light</b> should rise on average from ~ 0. 5 % to approximately 20 % from small galaxy halos to poor groups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale to a near-constant fraction of roughly ~ 20 % in galaxy clusters, although this asymptotic value may {{be as high as}} ~ 40 %, depending on the empirical model used to populate satellite halos with stars. The mass-dependent <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass.
