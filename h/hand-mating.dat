40|$|Farrowing rate can {{be defined}} as: 1) the number of mated females that farrow within a {{contemporary}} group per total number of MATED females for this group or 2) the number of females that farrow within a contemporary group per total number of EXPOSED females for this group. Generally, the first definition is used when <b>hand-mating,</b> whereas the second definition has to be used when pen-mating. Regardless of the definition, farrowing rate can be maximized only by taking total control of the breeding herd. High farrowing rates will result when fertility is high in boars, sows, and gilts; however, excellent management must be used to maintain high fertility in males and females. North Carolina State University data have shown a high correlation between farrowing rate and live pigs born per bred sow per year (Figure 1). Their data show that for each 10 % increase in farrowing rate of bred sows, there is a corresponding increase of 2. 63 live pigs born per sow per year. In light of these data, pork producers should strive to maximize farrowing rate. This {{can be done by}} providing good management during prebreeding, breeding, and gestation phases. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide information on possible management practices to use during each of these phases...|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} effects of male {{surgical}} treatments on copulation, we compared normal pairs that were <b>hand-mated</b> but not interrupted until the end of copulation. In this case, we recorded the total number of male abdominal movements, the duration of copulation from genital contact to release and sperm in the bursa and spermatheca. The number of pairs examined were 18 for wild controls, 8 for manipulated controls, 11 for pairing of males without the right process, 8 for pairing of males without the left process, and 6 for pairing of males without both processes, although a few values were missing due to difficulties in measuring them in the field or failure of sperm count in the laboratory.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the values of}} amniotic fluid (AF) progesterone and biochemical constituents and its associated placenta traits in Iranian crossbred ewes (Arkhar-Merino×Ghezel). MethodsSixty ewes (2 - 5 years old, weighing 40 - 50 kg) were treated with controlled internal drug release induced 30 mg progesterone for 14 d and were injected with 400 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin {{at the time of}} CIDR withdrawal. After the detection of estrus, ewes were <b>hand-mated.</b> After expelling of each fetus accompanied by fetal membranes, 10 mL AF was taken from fetal sac for spectrophotometer methods (glucose, urea, creatinine, total protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium and phosphorus) and radioimmunoassay (progesterone) analysis. ResultsResults indicated that there were highly positive correlations between placental efficiency and cotyledon density (r= 0. 764, P 0. 01), except for PW (r= 0. 665). ConclusionsIn conclusion, the significant correlation between the AF biochemical and progesterone with placental traits for the above-mentioned metabolites suggests that metabolic changes in AF levels will reflect the condition in the AF...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the trace mineral concentrations (Mg, Se, Zn, Cu and Fe) in amniotic fluid (AF) in 40 pregnancy toxemia Ghezel ewes at the time of parturition phase and its association with placental traits. Methods: Animals were treated with controlled internal drug release for 14  d and injected 400  IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin at the time of controlled internal drug release removal. After the detection of estrus by use of teaser rams, ewes were <b>hand-mated.</b> Ewes were classified as having subclinical pregnancy toxemia on the basis of beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHBA) results (BHBA >  0. 86  mmol/L). Results: The overall mean AF traces of mineral concentrations were 3. 13  ng/mL, 22. 1  μg/dL, 134. 7  μg/dL, 122. 5  μg/dL and 166. 6  μg/dL, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between placental efficiency and Zn concentration in AF ewes (r =  0. 633, P    0. 01), except for placental weight (r =  0. 808, P <  0. 01). Also, no significant correlation was detected between BHBA with the above trace minerals. Conclusions: Overall, determinations of these trace minerals in the AF ewes could have been used to obtain information on nutritional and reproductive status for the diagnosis of pregnancy toxemia in Ghezel ewes...|$|R
40|$|Bari, F., Khalid, M., Wolf, B., Haresign, W., Murray, A., Merrell, B. (2003). The {{repeatability}} of superovulatory {{response and}} embryo recovery in sheep. ? Theriogenology, 56, (1), 147 - 155. Sponsorship: MAFFOver an 8 -year period, {{a total of}} 328 Scottish Blackface donor ewes {{were involved in a}} MOET program. They were synchronized with fluorogestone acetate sponges and superovulated with ovine FSH. After the onset of estrus, ewes were <b>hand-mated</b> and laparoscopic artificial insemination was performed with fresh semen 44 ? 46 h after sponge removal. Embryos were recovered semi-laparoscopically on either Day 5 or Day 6 after insemination. Of the 328 donor ewes used, 222 ewes were supervoulated only once, while the remaining ewes were superovulated either twice (73 ewes), 3 times (26 ewes) or 4 times (7 ewes) at yearly intervals to generate a maximum of 474 records for subsequent analysis. There was no significant change in either mean ovulation rate or the mean number of embryos recovered per donor ewe at successive treatments. However, significant (P < 0. 05 at least) effects of both year and donor ewe age existed for superovulatory response and number of embryos recovered, though only the effect of year was significant (P < 0 001) for percentage (r = 0. 55, s e. 0. 055) and number of embryos recovered (r = 0. 38, SE 0. 074), but not for percentage embryo recovered (r = 0. 04, SE 0. 102).

40|$|The {{effect of}} energy intake during a 21 -day {{lactation}} and from weaning to estrus on sow and litter performance was studied. Lactation treatments {{consisted of two}} energy intakes, either 8 (Low Energy; LE) or 16 (High Energy, HE) Meal of metabolized energy (ME) per sow per day. Lactation diets were equivalent to daily feed intakes of 6 or 12 lb, respectively, of a grain-soybean meal diet. Energy intake from weaning to first estrus was either 5. 5 (LE) or 11 (HE) Meal of ME per sow per day, formulated to approximate feeding of 4 or 8 lb of a grain-soybean meal diet daily. Any sow in estrus by 30 days postweaning was artificially inseminated or <b>hand-mated</b> and fed 4 lb daily of a 14 % grain-soybean meal diet during gestation. Sows remained on the same lactation-post weaning energy intakes during two parities. First and second parity sows fed 8 Meal/day during lactation lost more (P<. 05) weight and backfat during lactation compared to sows fed 16 Mcal of ME/day. Likewise, litters nursing sows fed LE weighed less at weaning. Regardless of lactation treatments, first-parity sows fed 11 Mcal/day from weaning to first estrus gained more backfat (P<. 05) during the first 14 days postweaning and more weight (P<. 01) during the initial 28 days postweaning compared to those fed 5. 5 Meal of ME/day. Slightly fewer first-parity sows fed LE during lactation were in estrus by 7 days postweaning compared to those fed HE. Increasing energy intake from weaning to first estrus {{had no effect on}} percentage of sows exhibiting estrus by 14 days postweaning. These results indicate that increasing the energy intake of first-litter sows during lactation or from weaning to estrus will minimize weight and backfat loss during the feeding period but will not substantially reduce the number of days from weaning to estrus in the first two parities...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} ewes {{in order to develop}} an oestrus–ovulation short time synchronization protocol based on combined FGA, PGF 2, GnRH, eCG treatments, for use in dairy sheep before natural service (Experiment 1) or for fixed-time artificial insemination (Experiment 2), during the breeding season. In Experiment 1 seventy-five non-lactating dairy ewes were subdivided into 5 treatment groups (N= 15) : (1) Group Fe – control, which received FGA vaginal sponges (14 days) + eCG (Day 14); (2) Group FPe, FGA (5 days) + PGF 2 (Day 5) + eCG (Day 5); (3) Group PFe, PGF 2 (Day 0) + FGA (5 days) + eCG (Day 5); (4) Group PFG, PGF 2 (Day 0) + FGA (5 days) +GnRH (30 h after sponge removal, s. r.); (5) Group GPe, GnRH(Day 0) + PGF 2 (Day 5) + eCG(Day 5). Eweswere checked for oestrus and <b>hand-mated.</b> Time of ovulation was recorded by laparoscopy for 10 animals from each treatment. The percentages of female in oestrus and the interval to oestrus (h after treatment), fertility and prolificacy rate were recorded. There were no treatment differences in the percentage of females in oestrus. The interval to oestrus was earlier in Fe Group and delayed in FPe Group (P < 0. 01). Ovulation time was earlier in GPe Group compared to FPe Group (P < 0. 05). Fertility rates were significantly different (P < 0. 05) between the PFe and the FPeG Groups compared with the PFG Group. No significant differences were observed in prolificacy among the treatments. In Experiment 2, sixty dry ewes were subdivided (N= 20) into the following three experimental treatment groups: (1) Group FP, FGA (5 days) + PGF 2 (Day 5); (2) Group FPG, FGA (5 days) + PGF 2 (Day 5) +GnRH (30 h s. r.); (3) Group FPeG, FGA (5 days) + PGF 2 (Day 5) + eCG (Day 5) +GnRH (30 h s. r.). These were further subdivided into two groups (N= 10) corresponding to 52 and 60 h s. r. fixed-time insemination. Laparoscopic intrauterine insemination was performed with frozen semen (80 × 106 spermatozoa/dose) and ovulation time was recorded in a subgroup (N= 10). GnRH resulted in an earlier ovulation time (P < 0. 05) in FPG and FPeG Groups (53. 0 h vs 61. 6 h). Fertility rate was higher in FPeG treated ewes inseminated at 60 h s. r. (60...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at oestrus {{synchronization}} by applying progestagen-impregnated intravaginal sponges for either 7 or 12 days to lactating goats during the breeding season and at {{the determination of the}} effects of post-mating GnRH injection on fertility. The study was conducted in 80 hair goats aged between 2 - 5 years. The goats were allocated to two equal groups, one of which was applied short-term intravaginal sponge treatment and the other long-term treatment. The duration of intravaginal sponge treatment was 7 days in the short-term group (ST, n = 40) and 12 days in the long-term group (LT, n = 40). Furthermore, on the day of intravaginal sponge removal, the goats received intramuscular injections of 400 IU of PMSG and 0. 075 mg of cloprostenol. In both groups, 12 h after the removal of the vaginal sponges, 10 fertile bucks were introduced into the flock for oestrus detection twice a day and goats which were determined to be in oestrus were <b>hand-mated</b> to the assigned bucks. Immediately after mating, the goats included in each of the ST and LT groups were randomly assigned to two subgroups, referred to as ST 1 (n = 18), ST 2 (n = 18), LT 1 (n = 18) and LT 2 (n = 18). The subgroups ST 1 and LT 1 were maintained as controls whilst the subgroups ST 2 and LT 2 were administered with 5 mcg of bucerelin acetate immediately after mating. In the present study, the times of oestrus onset and oestrus rates in the ST and LT groups were determined as 33. 3 ± 1. 4 and 35. 0 ± 1. 4 h and 94. 7 and 97. 2 %, respectively. The differences observed between the two groups for the time of oestrus onset and oestrus rate were statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). In the subgroups ST 1, ST 2, LT 1 and LT 2, pregnancy rates were determined as 55. 5, 50, 50 and 55. 5 %, respectively whilst the parturition rate of all four subgroups was 100 %. Furthermore, litter sizes were detected as 150, 200, 188 and 170 % in the subgroups ST 1, ST 2, LT 1 and LT 2, respectively. The differences observed between the subgroups for pregnancy rate, parturition rate and litter size were statistically insignificant (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, it was demonstrated in the present study that GnRH administrations immediately after mating to lactating goats in which oestrus synchronization was performed by means of short and long-term intravaginal sponge treatment during the breeding season did not improve pregnancy rate, parturition rate and litter size...|$|R
