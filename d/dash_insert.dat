50|$|The 1934 Ford (the Model 40B) {{was not as}} {{substantial}} a {{model year}} change as {{the previous two years}} had been. Noticeable changes included a flatter grille with a wider surround and fewer bars, straight hood louvers, two handles {{on each side of the}} hood, smaller head lights and cowl lamps, and a reworked logo. The bare metal <b>dash</b> <b>insert</b> was replaced by painted steel.|$|E

5000|$|The Fairmont was {{the entry}} level luxury {{model of the}} AU range to {{face-off}} its main rival, the Holden Berlina. It had all of the fittings of the Futura but included extras such as a honeycomb grille, an 80-second headlamp off delay, wood grain-look <b>dash</b> <b>inserts,</b> unique 15" [...] wheels, dual horns, Fairmont badging on the boot lid and an analogue clock. The Fairmont was offered in sedan and station wagon bodystyles. Above the Fairmont was the Fairmont Ghia, which was the highest non-performance specification model in the range and sedan only. It had additional features that included unique wheels and more wood grain-look <b>dash</b> <b>inserts.</b> Fairmont & Fairmont Ghia models were not badged as Falcons.|$|R
5000|$|Also new was the SL/E version, {{which used}} many {{interior}} options from the TC [...] "Sandpiper" [...] series {{such as the}} radio/cassette, four-spoke steering wheel, timber <b>dash</b> <b>inserts,</b> velour seat trim, loop pile carpet and timber (Hardboard) door trim inserts. The SL/E also received the five-speed manual as standard.|$|R
5000|$|The Legacy {{is offered}} as a sedan with black interior; {{specifications}} are similar to European [...] "Comfort" [...] trim package.

The Legacy 2.5i Sport Premium CVT adds dual front electric seats, carbon-fibre <b>dash</b> <b>inserts,</b> alloy pedals, sports front bumper and grille; Bilstein suspension, 18-inch alloy wheels and Xenon headlights with headlight washers to the Premium package.

50|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{partnered with}} Hurst Performance Research Corporation {{to create the}} Hurst/Olds rather than just adding Hurst {{shifters}} as with earlier models. The limited regular production run of 515 Hurst/Olds (459 Holiday Coupes/56 Sport Coupes) started out as regular 4-4-2s, but were treated to numerous distinct enhancements, both cosmetic and mechanical. All cars were painted Peruvian Silver (a Toronado color) with liberal black striping and white pinstripes, exterior and interior H/O badging (unique to '68), and a real walnut wood <b>dash</b> <b>insert.</b> Mechanically, the cars left the factory with two drive train combinations. Red 455 CID engines were backed by modified W-30 Turbo 400 automatic transmissions. A/C cars got a W-46 engine with a 3.08:1 rear while non-A/C cars got a W-45 engine with a 3.91:1 rear. While both engines were rated at , the W-45 engine received the cylinder heads from the W-30 and the camshaft from the W-31, making it more suitable for higher rpms. All cars came with bucket seats and a Hurst Dual-Gate shifter in a mini-console. Also standard were numerous regular 4-4-2 options such as disc brakes, heavy duty cooling, and FE2 suspension. They shared the red fender wells and ram air setup with the W-30. Popular, but not standard, additional options included the tick-tock-tach and wood-grained steering wheel. Power front disc brakes were optional.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the Style manual (For authors, {{editors and}} printers, Sixth edition), also {{specifies}} that em <b>dashes</b> <b>inserted</b> between words, {{a word and}} numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (⸺) also explains that the 2-em {{can be used to}} mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several em dashes with spaces in between): ...|$|R
50|$|Sentence {{punctuation}} is {{not changed}} when using <b>dashes,</b> so an <b>inserted</b> sentence before a comma is usually {{followed by a}} comma nonetheless, even though some might see this usage as rather pedantic.|$|R
50|$|The {{user can}} {{deactivate}} the touch interface of The Dash to prevent unintended {{interaction with the}} device. This is done by a short hold on both left and right Dash at the same time. While Touch Lock is activated, no interaction with the touch interface is possible. To activate the touch interface, the user needs to remove the left <b>Dash</b> and <b>insert</b> into ear again.|$|R
