5000|$|He conferred nas {{upon his}} nephew Taher Saifuddin in 1915, in Dumas, Surat. When his nephew came to seek his blessing {{the next day}} he was {{informed}} about the nas. His nephew's eyes were filled with tears. At that time he called his nephew closer and keeping a hand over his nephew's shoulders he said, [...] "Brother, I know that the dark clouds of a conspiracy is already looming above and you are all alone.

In [...] "The Giuoco Piano Affair", a THRUSH operative offers this summary of Solo's character --"For a man like you, if there's the smallest <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> no matter how insignificant the cause, {{you have to make the}} ultimate sacrifice.

I could silence the beliefs which are the mother-tongue of my soul and speak with the rote-learned {{language}} of a system, that gives you the spelling of all things, sure of its alphabet covering them all. I could silence them: may not a man silence his awe or his love, and take to finding reasons, which others demand? But if his love lies deeper than any reasons to be found? Man finds his pathways: at first they were foot tracks, {{as those of the}} beast in the wilderness: now they are swift and invisible: his thought dives through the ocean, and his wishes thread the air: has he found all the pathways yet? What reaches him, stays with him, rules him: he must accept it, not knowing its pathway. Say, my expectation of you has grown but as false hopes grow. That <b>doubt</b> is <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> Well, my expectation was there, and you are come. Men have died of thirst. But I was thirsty, and the water is on my lips?

5000|$|In {{spite of}} the coming of April Fool's Day, the website {{received}} feedback from {{a large number of}} fairy believers, accumulating over 20,000 hits in one day. On April 1st, Baines appended a note to the website, thanking the readers for expressing their interest in his story and acknowledging that the fairy corpse was fake. He wrote: [...] "Even if you believe in fairies, as I personally do, there will always have been an element of <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that would suggest the remains are a hoax. However, the magic created by the possibility of the fairy being real is something you will remember {{for the rest of your}} life." [...] Subsequently, Baines listed the mummified fairy on eBay and the model attracted nearly 40 bids. The highest at the close of the sale was made by a private art collector in the United States and the fairy was sold for £280.|$|E

Both Q and Rolling Stone offered similar praise, and also noted that it was another step in the right direction. Altsounds.com gave a similar review remarking that there are [...] "Drums that you would expect in a Rihanna song and melodies you would expect from a band like Friendly Fires and the [...] "oohs" [...] from 3OH!3 is what you first hear. That is, of course, until Chris Martin's vocals come into play and there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that this is Coldplay.

5000|$|Gaitskell's {{position}} {{became more}} cautious during the summer, and he suggested the dispute with Egypt should {{be referred to}} the United Nations. His first speech on Suez (2 August 1956) attacked Nasser and was welcomed by many Conservatives, and implied that he would {{support the use of}} force, but in Brivati's view did not give enough emphasis to his stipulation that it be done through the United Nations. He had believed Eden’s assurances that {{he had no intention of}} using force. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August Gaitskell condemned Nasser, but warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: [...] "Lest there should be any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Nor, in my opinion, would such an attack be justified in order to impose a system of international control over the canal - desirable though this is. If, of course, the whole matter were to be taken to the United Nations and if Egypt were to be condemned by them as aggressors, then, of course, the position would be different. And if further action which amounted to obvious aggression by Egypt were taken by Nasser, then again it would be different. So far what Nasser has done amounts to a threat, a grave threat to us and to others, which certainly cannot be ignored; but it is only a threat, not in my opinion justifying retaliation by war." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gaitskell's support {{became more}} cautious. On 2 August {{he said of}} Nasser's behaviour, [...] "It is all very familiar. It {{is exactly the same}} that we {{encountered}} from Mussolini and Hitler in those years before the war". He cautioned Eden, however, that [...] "we must not, therefore, allow ourselves to get into a position where we might be denounced in the Security Council as aggressors, or where the majority of the Assembly was against us". He had earlier warned Eden that Labour might not support Britain acting alone against Egypt. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August 1956, Gaitskell condemned Nasser but again warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: Lest there should be any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.

In the month following the public release of the interface changes suggested in this paper in august 2008 the Internet based sports games company PowerChallenge saw an increase in sales of more than 60 % (see results). Using heuristic evaluation and simple user testing the complexity of accessing PowerChallenge’s products has been drastically reduced and this has resulted in fewer customers losing their way in the process. Along with slimlining the process of acquiring products the entire web portal has had a graphics remake to make a trustworthy first impression on users. The increased fear of phishing 1 and general uncertainty {{about the safety of}} online shopping[6] makes many users abandon their intentions of spending money whenever the site drastically changes it’s looks {{in the middle of the}} payment flow. This has been partially remedied but may require more work. An iterative design process has been applied throughout this project...|$|E

40|$|There's {{two seconds}} left in the {{championship}} game, your team is behind by one point and you are at the free throw line shooting two shots. You're keenly aware of the situation and you, like everyone else in the sold out arena, know how important these two shots are. You can feel your heart pounding and your legs are a little weak as you bounce the ball and prepare for your first shot. You take a last deep breath and push the ball towards the basket. You watch with considerable anxiety as the ball hits the front of the rim and bounces straight up. It comes back down and starts rolling around the rim, finally dropping through. As the ball drops through the hoop you feel a tremendous sense of relief. It's as if all {{the weight of the world}} has been lifted from your shoulders. The ball is passed to you by the referee for your second shot and you step up to the line and dribble the ball. This time, there is no thought of failure, there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> You know that you're going to make the shot. You take the last bounce, look to the basket, inhale, feel your knees bend slightly and begin pushing the ball towards the basket. It's effortless and you're in total control, you know before the ball leaves your hand that it's going through without even touching the rim. You feel the excitement as watch the ball spin through the air in slow motion towards it target. The moment almost seems frozen in time for you. Just before your second shot, you entered what athletes refer to as "the zone. " One of the primary roles sport psychologists have, consists of trying to help athletes get into the zone and stay there. To do that, we have to help athletes quiet thought processes. We have to teach them to shut out distractions, to trust their bodies, to simply let themselves perform...|$|E

It seems I haven’t {{seen you}} in months, darling, and it’s only been about twenty-eight hours. Every one seems to get longer and longer. Did you get to bed early Sunday night, young lady? You’d better have, {{you must have been}} tired, I know I was. I’m going to hit the sack right after I mail this. I feel like the wreck of the Hesperus. Did you have any snow down thar in New York? We had our first snow squall today, and man, is it cold. I was flying the first period this morning, and I could see the storm coming in from the North West like a huge white curtain. It was the first time I ever saw a snow storm from the air. It didn’t stick though, but it was snow. I knew {{something}} important had to happen this week. I’ve been looking over the financial situation, hon, and allowing for everything, a small amount of recreation included, I ought to have $ 4. 38 saved by March if I budget myself very carefully. Not bad for me, eh? But seriously, angel, it’s not as bad as all that. I’ve got some pretty good ideas as to how to raise some money, and I was talking to a fellow here that just bought an engagement and a wedding ring, and they’re not too expensive, at least not $ 500. But as you said before, you don’t get married every day, so by God we’re going to have the best. But most of all, darling, I want you to be happy. If there is ever any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> just let me know. We’ve still got {{a lot of things to}} settle, hon. I want to have a long talk with you this weekend. Oh by the way, have you told your father yet? I wonder what he’ll have to say. Maybe I better send him another carton of cigarettes. Well hon, the sergeant just finished drawing my bath, I don’t want to keep him waiting. Give my best to your family. Your mother is really marvelous. I love you. Take care of yourself and get some sleep. I think of you always honey, and miss you terribly. All my loveJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
