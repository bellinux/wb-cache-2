The techni-a 1 aspects of the simulation have previously been published. The issue of how much the <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> vehicle contribute to accident involvement is addressed, and antilock brake evalua-tion is used as an example. ...|$|R

5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

50|$|When in motion, the <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> {{passengers}} are travelling {{at the same}} speed as the car.

A seatbelt applies an opposing force to the <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> passengers to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car. Seatbelts are considered Primary Restraint Systems (PRS), because of their vital role in occupant safety.|$|R
5|$|Red Bull Racing {{suffered}} a double retirement, with Vettel falling victim to another alternator failure and Mark Webber spinning violently at the Ascari chicane, with the resultant {{damage to his}} tyres sending vibrations through the car that forced him to retire.
