25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully aware of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

Harrison later spoke of their {{familiarity}} with one another resulting in McCartney, especially, failing to recognise his artistic growth; in I, Me, Mine, he refers to [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as reflecting [...] "that concept of how everybody sees and treats everybody else, allowing no consideration for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> changing all the time".|$|E

[...] "Our new leaders seemed to turn their backs upon the sea and to ignore the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> an island". Each year the fleet declined. In 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. This number dropped every year until 1939 when, {{at the start of}} World War II, the fleet numbered only 56 ships. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels. There were several reasons for this decline: a consequence of the war of independence, a policy of self-sufficiency, the economic depression, the lack of investment and government neglect. Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were withdrawn. [...] "In the period April 1941 and June 1942 only seven such ships visited the country".|$|E

Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated {{as a result of}} what became known as the [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." [...] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2percent.|$|E

Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision not to answer all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it almost seems like a primer".|$|E

500|$|A {{writer for}} Disney.com observed, [...] "The creepiness of this song {{lies in the}} fact that the very untrustworthy Mother Gothel is {{positioning}} herself as a helpful figure to Rapunzel." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed wrote that the song, its purpose having been summarized by Curt Holman of Creative Loafing as [...] "simply to manipulate Rapunzel into staying at home," [...] "perfectly disguises Mother Gothel's true motives." [...] According to Simon Miraudo of Quickflix, Gothel craftily uses the song to guilt trip Rapunzel [...] "into staying in the tower ... frightened into imagining the horrors that lay outside her door." [...] In her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) the Art of Adapting Fairy Tales, author Conny Eisfeld observed that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] emphasizes Gothel's [...] "status of superiority", in spite of the fact that [...] "her existence solely depend on Rapunzel." [...] Bitch identified Gothel as an abusive mother, writing, [...] "she is manipulative, dishonest, and dedicated to undermining her daughter's independence. This is shown consistently through all her appearances in the film, but comes out clearly very early indeed, with the song 'Mother Knows Best'. Critics have often identified the sequence as one of the film's darkest and edgiest moments. Acknowledging the song's [...] "extremely dark undertone", Anthony Falco of Film Class Junkies wrote, [...] "This song rues in the fact that a child is impressionable; Rapunzel believes that Mother Gothel has the best intentions, but obviously, the evil witch is using the princess for her own gains. Falco continued, [...] "The audience knows what Gothel wants with Rapunzel, but the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> unable to protect the naïve princess results in further hatred for the witch." [...] Falco also concluded that Gothel's [...] "sinister reprise at the end of Tangled allows for these horrifying undertones to emerge, which makes 'Mother Knows Best' one of the most sinister villain songs in the Disney library." [...] Similarly, Elissa Smith of Paper Droids wrote that while the audience is fully aware of Gothel's evil intentions, Rapunzel is denied [...] "the outsider's point of view." [...] Glen Chapman of Den of Geek wrote that the scene [...] "strikes a balance between melodic and narrative sophistication, as well as being equal parts sweet and sinister." [...] Gothel later reprises the song [...] "in indelible fashion." ...|$|E
