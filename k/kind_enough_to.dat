25|$|That night, Tiana's {{hopes are}} crushed when {{the owners of}} the mill tell her that she was outbid by someone for the sugar mill and that it is {{probably}} a good thing given her 'background'. When Tiana accidentally ruins her costume, Charlotte is <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> replace it with one of her own. Out of desperation, Tiana wishes on a star, only to be greeted by a talking frog, who claims to be Prince Naveen. Mistaking her for a princess because of her costume, Naveen promises to give Tiana the money she needs if she turns him human again by kissing him. After some persuasion, Tiana succumbs, but becomes a frog instead.|$|E
25|$|Land, the {{immobile}} property, and its produce {{were both}} taxable, as {{the king was}} owed a share for being the administrator of the land. Landlords and Peasants paid the tax - the land tax was known as Irai or Karai and the tax on produce was called Vari. It is believed that one-sixth of the produce was collected as tax. During times of floods and famines, cultivation was much affected and the kings {{were known to be}} <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make remissions. Taxes were collected by revenue officials known as Variya and Kavidi and they were assisted by accountants called Ayakanakkar. There were graneries, known as Kalanjiyam, in public places {{as well as in the}} houses of the farmers to store excess grain so that people did not suffer in times of floods or famines. The Manram (council) of the village took necessary decisions to safeguard the interests of the people.|$|E

25|$|For {{five and}} a half years during the Second World War, Wilson's was {{evacuated}} to a Camp School at Itchingfield near Horsham, Sussex, and for the only period in its history became a boarding school. The whole compound stood around a broad elliptical area, set in large part to grass and the remainder, an asphalt quadrangle. Radiating from this central area, in spoke-like fashion, was a series of large cedarwood huts. These were the dormitories, ablution blocks and classrooms. Two larger buildings stood adjacent to the asphalted space, one the dining hall and the other the assembly hall which also functioned as the gym, cinema and church. The whole establishment catered for four hundred plus boys forming six houses, all named after past headmasters of the school, Nairn, Macdowell, Wilson, Kelly, Whiteley and Jephson. The Head Master of Christ's Hospital was <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow Wilson's the use of the school's cricket pitches, swimming bath and other facilities, including the Great Hall for Speech Day.|$|E

He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look on me as a wild animal, be <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E

500|$|American street artist Fairey guest {{starred in}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] as himself. The {{graffiti}} art featuring Homer's {{face and the}} word [...] "dope" [...] that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama [...] "Hope" [...] poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though I had to make fun of myself to do so)."

2500|$|Descartes {{submitted}} his manuscript to many philosophers, {{theologians and}} a logician before publishing the Meditations.

In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader [...] "not to pass judgment on the Meditations until they have been <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> read through all these objections and my replies to them.” [...] Thus, this dialogue could be seen {{as an integral part of}} Descartes' views expressed in the Meditations.|$|E

[...] Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.|$|R
5000|$|From his {{hospital}} bed, Van Gogh asked for Gauguin continually {{over the next}} number of days, but the Frenchman stayed away.

Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown." [...] Kopechne told no one that she was leaving with Kennedy, and left her purse and hotel key at the party.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, Westbrook's axing was {{reported}} in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the Channel 4 chat show, The Girlie Show, and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist. Westbrook has since commented, [...] "The producers were very nice about it all. Rather than killing [...] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] they were <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'.

If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was <b>kind</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
