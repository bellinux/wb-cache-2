5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind.</b> It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E

I have spoken as if the plant had received both <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds</b> of pollen, and this is, of course, possible; but, from the enclosed position of the shortest stamens, it is much more probable that the stigma received exclusively pollen from the mid-length stamens; and this, as may be seen in Table 4.23.5, is the more fertile of the two self-unions.|$|R

25|$|Tectonic {{plates are}} {{composed}} of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> of crust. Along convergent boundaries, subduction, or one plate moving under another, carries the lower one down into the mantle; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the lithosphere remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is {{also referred to as}} the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories, since disproven, proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe.|$|E

Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory. There are also continuous graphs, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of design research {{has led to}} the establishment of design as a coherent discipline of study in <b>its</b> <b>own</b> right, based on the view that design has <b>its</b> <b>own</b> things to know and <b>its</b> <b>own</b> ways of knowing them. Bruce Archer again encapsulated the view in stating his new belief that ‘there exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating, and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of enquiry when applied to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds</b> of problems’. This view was developed further in a series of papers by Nigel Cross, collected as a book on 'Designerly Ways of Knowing'. Significantly, Donald Schön promoted the new view within his book The Reflective Practitioner, in which he challenged the technical rationality of Simon and sought to establish ‘an epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic, intuitive processes which and other practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness and value conflict’.|$|R

25|$|The Coast {{as it was}} called, also invented <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> {{of dance}} hall, called a Barbary Coast Dance Hall. It was {{different}} than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies. And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe. Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it {{was referred to as}} the Paris of America. Drug addicts of the district could even buy cocaine or morphine at an all night Grant Street drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer. And during the 1890s San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.|$|E
25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kind</b> of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a wonderful place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E

40|$|It {{took over}} one hundred years for William Shakespeare to gain the {{literary}} pre-eminence familiar to contemporary readers. A renewed interest in the author’s work during the eighteenth century was marked by theatrical revivals, new editions of the plays and renowned Shakespearean performances by famed actor David Garrick. But with this resurgence in popularity, some readers began {{to call attention to}} perceived gaps in the bard’s biography. In the mid- 1790 s, these gaps were briefly filled with ‘newly discovered’ letters, deeds and occasional poetry, exhibited to the public and finally published in 1796. Forged by William Henry Ireland, these documents refashioned Shakespeare to the tastes of his age. The forger went on to make larger creative impositions upon the life and work of the dramatist, writing himself into the playwright’s life and adapting his plays to meet eighteenth-century standards of decorum. And by the 1790 s, literary forgery itself ‘bordered on a literary genre with <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>kinds</b> of rules and aspirations’. Enthralled by the notoriety of other literary forgers, Ireland created his own literature under a Shakespearean guise. Whilst his forgeries were quickly exposed, they ultimately served Ireland in establishing a literary identity of his own. </p...|$|R

Of the many claimants to socialism only one has a valid title—that socialism which views democracy as valuable per se, which stands for democracy unequivocally, and which continually modifies socialist ideas and programs in the light of democratic experience. This is the socialism of the labor, social-democratic, and socialist parties of Western Europe. Kenneth Arrow argued that: [...] "We cannot be sure that the principles of democracy and socialism are compatible until we can observe a viable society following both principles. But there is no convincing evidence or reasoning which would argue that a democratic-socialist movement is inherently self-contradictory. Nor need we fear that gradual moves in the direction of increasing government intervention will lead to an irreversible move to [...] "serfdom." [...] to The Road to Serfdom."

40|$|This report {{presents}} theoretical {{predictions of}} the behavior of spin polarized systems in motion. More specifically, it looks at systems which have been configured to contain only two specific spin states. When a magnetic field is applied the two different "species" undergo different accelerations, resulting in interspecies collisions that, due to momentum transfer between the spin states, tend the system to an equilibrium with equal drift velocities of each spin species. This drag phenomenon is the primary focus of this report. By using the Boltzmann equation we predict quantum effects within a range of drift velocities around zero. The boson system portrays Bose-enhancement (significantly higher momentum transfer), while the fermion system manifests Pauli blocking (significantly lower momentum transfer).
