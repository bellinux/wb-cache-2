5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the <b>epiphyseal</b> bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the <b>epiphyseal</b> plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the <b>epiphyseal</b> plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary <b>epiphyseal</b> dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

25|$|Isotretinoin may stop {{long bone}} growth {{in young people}} who are still growing. Several reports state that {{premature}} <b>epiphyseal</b> closure can occur in acne patients receiving recommended doses of Accutane.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} have not yet {{undergone}} or completed <b>epiphyseal</b> closure, growth hormone can be administered, potentially in conjunction with an aromatase inhibitor or a GnRH analogue, to increase final height.|$|E
25|$|Hales's work on {{the growth}} pattern of long bones, demonstrating <b>epiphyseal</b> growth; his {{demonstration}} of spinal reflexes in the frog and his suggestion that electricity {{played a role in}} allowing nerves to control muscle function are also noteworthy.|$|E
25|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is {{separation}} of immature articular cartilage from underlying bone. It {{is caused by}} osteochondrosis, which is characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification of <b>epiphyseal</b> cartilage. It is most commonly seen in the stifle, elbow, shoulder, and hock.|$|E
25|$|The {{hormone that}} dominates female {{development}} is an estrogen called estradiol. While estradiol promotes {{growth of the}} breasts and uterus, {{it is also the}} principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and <b>epiphyseal</b> maturation and closure. Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{occurs in}} long bones {{and most other}} bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes {{the development of a}} cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the primary and secondary ossification centers, and the formation of articular cartilage and the <b>epiphyseal</b> plates.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol has a {{profound}} effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as <b>epiphyseal</b> closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone structure is affected also, resulting in early osteopenia and osteoporosis. Also, women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for both the pubertal growth spurt, which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and <b>epiphyseal</b> closure, which limits height and limb length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens {{are responsible}} for bone maturation and maintenance of bone mineral density throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of osteoporosis increases during menopause.|$|E
25|$|In {{knockout}} studies, TRAP−/− mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis, {{associated with}} reduced osteoclast activity. These result in thickening and shortening of the cortices, formation of club-like deformities in the distal femur, and widened <b>epiphyseal</b> growth plates with delayed mineralization of cartilage, {{all of which}} increase with age. In TRAP overexpressing transgenic mice, mild osteoporosis occurs along with increased osteoblast activity and bone synthesis.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} severe side effects can occur if {{adolescents}} use AAS. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature <b>epiphyseal</b> fusion through {{increased levels of}} estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. Other effects include, {{but are not limited}} to, accelerated bone maturation, increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature sexual development. AAS use in adolescence is also correlated with poorer attitudes related to health.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and <b>epiphyseal</b> closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild gynecomastia or even developing swellings under nipples during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Methyltestosterone {{should be}} used with caution in women and children, as it can cause {{irreversible}} virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate <b>epiphyseal</b> closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone {{should not be used}} in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug {{should be used}} with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{skeletal}} and cartilaginous changes take {{place after the}} onset of puberty at various rates and times. Sometime in the late teen years <b>epiphyseal</b> closure (in other words, the ends of bones are fused closed) takes place {{and the length of}} bones is fixed for life. Consequently, total height and the length of arms, legs, hands, and feet are not affected by HRT. However, details of bone shape change throughout life, bones becoming heavier and more deeply sculptured under the influence of testosterone. Many of these differences are described in the Desmond Morris book Manwatching.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and <b>epiphyseal</b> closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthyroidism has unique {{effects in}} {{children}} on growth and pubertal development, e.g. causing <b>epiphyseal</b> maturation. In growing children, accelerated bone growth from hyperthyroidism can increase osteogenesis {{in the short}} term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. Pubertal development tends to be delayed, or slowed. Girls who have undergone menarche may develop secondary amenorrhea. Hyperthyroidism is associated with high sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may result in high serum estradiol levels in girls and testosterone levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased. Hyperthyroidism {{before the age of}} four may cause neurodevelopmental delay. A study by Segni et al. suggests that permanent brain damage can occur {{as a result of the}} illness.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenging}} aspects of long-term management is optimizing growth {{so that a}} child with CAH achieves his or her height potential because both undertreatment and overtreatment can reduce growth or the remaining time for growth. While glucocorticoids are essential for health, dosing is always a matter of approximation. In even mildly excessive amounts, glucocorticoids slow growth. On the other hand, adrenal androgens are readily converted to estradiol, which accelerates bone maturation {{and can lead to}} early <b>epiphyseal</b> closure. This narrow target of optimal dose is made more difficult to obtain by the imperfect replication of normal diurnal plasma cortisol levels produced by 2 or 3 oral doses of hydrocortisone. As a consequence, average height losses of about 4inches (10cm) have been reported with traditional management.|$|E
25|$|Following the CT {{scan of the}} Younger Lady, more {{detailed}} descriptions of the mummy have been published. A large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's chest, and the disarticulation of the right upper limb (arm) are the main indications that the body suffered mutilation by ancient tomb robbers. Otherwise the mummy has been fairly preserved. Despite previous disputes about the Lady's gender, the morphology of the skull and pelvis confirms {{that she was a}} human female (woman). The condition of the <b>epiphyseal</b> union and the closure of the cranial sutures suggest that the Lady was between 25 and 35-years-old {{at the time of her}} death. The Lady's height was 1,58 meters from the vertex to the heel. Her left humerus was 29.3 centimeters in length. Her left femur was 40.5 centimeters in length. Her left tibia was 35.2 centimeters in length.|$|E
500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of <b>epiphyseal</b> (growth) plate closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E
2500|$|Widening of {{the hips}} (if <b>epiphyseal</b> closure {{has not yet}} occurred; see below) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{width of}} the hips is not {{affected}} in individuals for whom <b>epiphyseal</b> closure (fusion and closure of the ends of bones, which prevents any further lengthening) has taken place. This occurs in most people between 18 and 25 years of age. [...] Already-established changes {{to the shape of}} the hips cannot be reversed by HRT whether <b>epiphyseal</b> closure has taken place or not.|$|E
2500|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{begins with}} {{points in the}} cartilage called [...] "primary ossification centers." [...] They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. [...] They {{are responsible for the}} formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. [...] Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. [...] The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the <b>epiphyseal</b> plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (<b>epiphyseal</b> closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. [...] The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.|$|E
2500|$|Achondroplasia {{is one of}} 19 {{congenital}} {{conditions with}} similar presentations, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple <b>epiphyseal</b> dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and [...] thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study {{at the same time}} found a rate of 1 per 10,000.|$|E
2500|$|Antiestrogens (or {{so-called}} [...] "estrogen blockers") like aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (e.g., anastrozole) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g., tamoxifen) {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the effects of high levels of endogenous estrogen (e.g., breast development, feminine fat distribution) in transgender men. In addition, in those who have not yet undergone or completed <b>epiphyseal</b> closure (which occurs during adolescence and is mediated by estrogen), antiestrogens can prevent hip widening as well as increase final height (estrogen limits height by causing the epiphyses to fuse).|$|E
2500|$|Isotretinoin has {{a number}} of muscoloskeletal effects. Myalgia (muscular pain) and {{arthralgia}} (joint pain) are rare side effects. [...] Retinoids, such as high dose etretinate, are well-known to cause bone changes, {{the most common type of}} which is hyperostotic changes (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents. Other problems include premature <b>epiphyseal</b> closure and calcification of tendons and ligaments. The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using X-ray imaging.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} is most {{commonly found in}} {{children between the ages}} of 4 and 8, but it can occur in {{children between the ages of}} 2 and 15. [...] The main long-term problem with this {{condition is}} that it can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head, which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. [...] It is also commonly known as Perthes disease, or Legg–Perthes disease. Perthes is a form of osteochondritis which only affects the hip, [...] although other forms [...] of osteochondritis can affect elbows, knees, ankles, and feet. [...] Bilateral Perthes, which means both hips are affected, should always be investigated thoroughly to rule out multiple <b>epiphyseal</b> dysplasia.|$|E
2500|$|Reich {{was born}} in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Mildred Dorf (née Freshman) and Edwin Saul Reich (1914–2016), who owned a women's {{clothing}} store. As a child, {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple <b>epiphyseal</b> dysplasia, also known as Fairbanks disease, a bone disorder that results in short stature among other symptoms. This condition made him a target for bullies and he sought out the protection of older boys; one of them was Michael Schwerner, who was later a victim in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner by the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 for the registration of African-American voters. Reich cites this event as an inspiration to [...] "fight the bullies, to protect the powerless, {{to make sure that the}} people without a voice have a voice." ...|$|E
