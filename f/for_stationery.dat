25|$|Since the Stelo was the {{currency}} of Esperantists, {{a good example of}} its utility was the publication of a monthly magazine and the payment of rents and salaries. The publisher of a monthly magazine receives subscription money, requires the services of a printer, and must pay <b>for</b> <b>stationery</b> and postage, etc. Under the influence of inflation costs will tend to increase but not {{all at the same time}} and not all in proportion to the inflation rate. Eventually the publisher must contemplate an increase to the annual subscription rate. The new annual rate usually has to be announced in September before the next calendar year.|$|E

[...] The Gillard Government in January 2011 extended tax cuts to parents to help pay <b>for</b> <b>stationery,</b> textbooks or computer equipment under the Education Tax Refund scheme.|$|E

[...] In contrast, the average annual family income in 1958 was around $5,000 and a factory worker in Philadelphia was averaging about $4,500 a year. [...] Retirement for members of Congress was granted after a minimum of six years of service and attainment {{of the age of}} 62.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand {{standard}} <b>for</b> school <b>stationery</b> (known formally as NZS 8132:1984 - Specification <b>for</b> school <b>stationery)</b> {{was established}} in 1984 by the 'Standards Association Ltd', New Zealand's national standards body. It specifies various types of stationery to ensure that different manufacturers produce compatible products of suitable quality. Standardisation enables schools and businesses to request or order appropriate <b>stationery</b> without regard <b>for</b> brand.|$|R
2500|$|Perruzza's {{election}} to the provincial legislature meant that {{he was forced to}} relinquish his seat on council. [...] He criticized North York councillors for choosing to appoint his replacement, rather than calling a by-election. [...] When it became obvious that no by-election would take place, Perruzza called for Mike Foster to be appointed to his seat. [...] The council instead chose Claudio Polsinelli, a defeated Liberal candidate. [...] Some North York councillors accused Perruzza of billing the city <b>for</b> <b>stationery</b> and business cards for use in his provincial campaign. [...] Perruzza denied this, acknowledging that he ordered a significant amount of paper in 1990 but saying that none of it went toward his provincial campaign.|$|E
2500|$|State {{schools are}} {{government}} funded and operated, and {{are free to}} New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. Students and parents however are expected to pay <b>for</b> <b>stationery,</b> uniforms, textbooks and school trips. Schools may ask for donations to supplement their government operational funding. While it is completely voluntary to pay the donation, some schools have been reported coercing parents into paying the donation by withholding school reports and not allowing students on trips for non-payment; Some schools, [...] especially those in affluent areas, request donations in excess of $1000 per year. Each state school is governed by an elected Board of Trustees, consisting of the school principal, a number of trustees (usually 5) elected by {{the parents of the}} students, one staff trustee elected by the school staff, and in secondary schools, one student trustee elected by the students. State schools follow the national curriculum, and are required to remain secular.|$|E
2500|$|In Malaysia, the {{displaying}} {{of cigarette}} packets in advertisements {{with a general}} warning on long-time smoking that came into effect in June 1976 has been banned since 1995. However, this has not stopped tobacco companies from advertising their products. There are also restrictions on tobacco advertising after the ban of displaying of cigarette packaging, print media advertising is restricted to only one page and advertising on television should not be more than 15 seconds. They {{have found ways to}} continue to build their brands by using brand names for a bistro and cybercafes such as Benson & Hedges Bistro and Sampoerna A International Cyberworld, <b>for</b> <b>stationery,</b> accessories, clothing like Dunhill, Marlboro Classics, Davidoff, Perilly's, Pall Mall, John Player Specials, Winfield and Winston. Tobacco companies also sponsor holiday tours like Mild Seven Seafarers Club, Peter Stuyvesant Travel and Tours, Kent Holidays and Salem Holidays as well as concerts and entertainment events. All of these are indirect advertising strategies employed by tobacco companies. Tobacco advertising continued without the display of cigarette packaging until January 2003, when the Malaysian federal government banned even such indirect advertising of tobacco brands, except in certain establishments licensed to sell tobacco products. Formula One Grand Prix and other sporting events are still allowed to use tobacco sponsorship. In 2009, Malaysian government halted the branding of cigarettes as [...] "light" [...] or [...] "mild" [...] on all smoking packages and has decided to place graphic images on the cigarette packs to show the adverse long-term effects of excessive smoking.|$|E

60|$|To be sure, poor Mr. Pordage had, {{by about}} now, got his Diplomatic coat {{into such a}} state as never was seen. What with the mud of the river, what with {{the water of the}} river, what with the sun, and the dews, and the tearing boughs, and the thickets, it hung about him in {{discoloured}} shreds like a mop. The sun had touched him a bit. He had taken to always polishing one particular button, which just held on to his left wrist, and to always calling <b>for</b> <b>stationery.</b> I suppose that man called for pens, ink, and paper, tape, and scaling-wax, upwards of one thousand times in four-and-twenty hours. He had an idea that we should never get out of that river unless we were written out of it in a formal Memorandum; and the more we laboured at navigating the rafts, the more he ordered us not to touch them at our peril, and the more he sat and roared <b>for</b> <b>stationery.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Then a {{military}} secretary, standing close to His Excellency, takes Mr. Tomkins {{by the neck}} and bends him down toward the floor and says very clearly and distinctly, [...] "Mr. Torpentine." [...] Then he throws him out by the neck into the crowd beyond and calls for another. The thing is done. Mr. Tomkins wipes the perspiration from his hair with his handkerchief and goes back at full speed to the Hoogli Hotel, Calcutta, eager <b>for</b> <b>stationery</b> to write at once to Ohio and say that he knows the Viceroy.|$|E
60|$|The archway and {{stairway}} of {{the hotel}} were draped with the Bavarian colors, and they were obscurely flattered to learn that Prince Leopold, {{the brother of the}} Prince-Regent of the kingdom, had taken rooms there, {{on his way to the}} manoeuvres at Nuremberg, and was momently expected with his suite. They realized that they were not of the princely party, however, when they were told that he had sole possession of the dining-room, and they went out to another hotel, and had their supper in keeping delightfully native. People seemed to come there to write their letters and make up their accounts, as well as to eat their suppers; they called <b>for</b> <b>stationery</b> like characters in old comedy, and the clatter of crockery and the scratching of pens went on together; and fortune offered the Marches a delicate reparation for their exclusion from their own hotel in the cold popular reception of the prince which they got back just in time to witness. A very small group of people, mostly women and boys, had gathered to see him arrive, but there was no cheering or any sign of public interest. Perhaps he personally merited none; he looked a dull, sad man, with his plain, stubbed features; and after he had mounted to his apartment, the officers of his staff stood quite across the landing, and barred the passage of the Americans, ignoring even Mrs. March's presence, as they talked together.|$|E

60|$|Scroope itself, {{though a}} large village, stood {{a good deal}} out of the world. Within {{the last year or}} two a railway has been opened, with a Scroope Road Station, not above three miles from the place; but in the old lord's time it was eleven miles from its nearest station, at Dorchester, with which it had {{communication}} once a day by an omnibus. Unless a man had business with Scroope nothing would take him there; and very few people had business with Scroope. Now and then a commercial traveller would visit the place with but faint hopes as to trade. A post-office inspector once in twelve months would call upon plethoric old Mrs. Applejohn, who kept the small shop <b>for</b> <b>stationery,</b> and was known as the postmistress. The two sons of the vicar, Mr. Greenmarsh, would pass backwards and forwards between their father's vicarage and Marlbro' school. And occasionally {{the men and women of}} Scroope would make a journey to their county town. But the Earl was told that old Mrs. Brock of the Scroope Arms could not keep the omnibus on the road unless he would subscribe to aid it. Of course he subscribed. If he had been told by his steward to subscribe to keep the cap on Mrs. Brock's head, he would have done so. Twelve pounds a year his Lordship paid towards the omnibus, and Scroope was not absolutely dissevered from the world.|$|E
60|$|We {{set about}} our task at once with great enthusiasm, trying {{for the first}} time in our lives to put our {{thoughts}} into writing. All went well for a few days. Then our editor called us together to hear an important communication he wished to make. First he showed us, but would not allow us to read or handle, a fair copy of the paper, or of the portion he had done, just to enable us to appreciate the care he was taking over it. He then went on to say that he could not give so much time to the task and pay <b>for</b> <b>stationery</b> as well without a small weekly contribution from us. This would only be about three-halfpence or twopence from our pocket-money, and would not be much missed. To this we all agreed at once except my younger brother, aged about seven at that time. Then, he was told, he would not be allowed to contribute to the paper. Very well, he wouldn't contribute to it, he said. In vain we all tried to coax him out of his stubborn resolve: he would not part with a copper of his money and would have nothing to do with The Tin Box. Then the Editor's wrath broke out, and he said he had already written his editorial, but would now, as a concluding article, write a second one in order to show up the person who had tried to wreck the paper, in his true colours. He would exhibit him as the meanest, most contemptible insect that ever crawled on the surface of the earth.|$|E
