5|$|However, the Ottomans forced John Sigismund {{to declare}} the treaty null and void on 21 April. John Sigismund and Hasan, Pasha of Temesvár, joined forces and recaptured Erdőd (now Ardud in Romania), Nagybánya and Szatmár. He {{intended}} to see the sultan in Istanbul to give {{an explanation for the}} Treaty of Szatmár, but Suleiman informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> personally come to Hungary.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Green {{joined with}} a group of Republican ward leaders who broke off from the main party, which was led by Sheriff Austin Meehan, to support Governor William Scranton.

5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing {{to the lack of}} funds to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food {{and spent most of}} the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{successes in}} Germany {{had made him}} popular with the soldiers. He had dealt a {{significant}} blow to Rome's enemies, quelled an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome. His actions had increased his fame, and he had become very popular with the Roman people. Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled to Rome and informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.|$|E

5|$|The Finns {{relied on}} {{military}} assistance from Sweden, and Eljas Erkko {{took part in}} the Stockholm assembly of Scandinavian leaders between 18 October and 19 October. There, Erkko met the Swedish foreign minister Rickard Sandler in private, and Sandler assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> persuade the Swedish government to assist Finland during a possible war. During the actual war, however, Sandler failed in this task and resigned. Finland was totally isolated by a German and Soviet blockade, and attempted in October to obtain arms and ammunition in absolute secrecy by enlisting the German arms dealer Josef Veltjens.|$|E
5|$|After {{six months}} of rehab he {{recovered}} earlier than expected. His 2008–09 season started on 25 November, as Gradi gave him a start at the Walkers Stadium, where Leicester City won 2–1. The next month he played six games, keeping four clean sheets (against Carlisle United, Cheltenham Town, Swindon Town and Millwall). However he attracted criticism from his manager {{at the end of}} January following heavy defeats to Northampton Town and Peterborough United, and was subsequently dropped. New manager Gudjon Thordarson told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be offered a new contract {{at the end of the}} season, thus ending Tomlinson's long association with the club.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{earned a}} Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale in 1923 and {{enrolled}} at Harvard Law School later that year. During the summer break of 1924, {{he returned to}} Kentucky, where his father, dying of Bright's disease, told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> soon become {{the head of the}} family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the economic recession of the early 1920s. Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs. He was admitted to the bar by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.|$|E

5|$|Newton House was {{originally}} built during the medieval period at {{some distance from}} the castle. It is documented to have been later modified in 1595 and 1603. The current Newton House was completed in 1660 under the command of Edward Rice. In the late 1700s, George Rice and his wife Cecil began the construction of a landscape garden, and hired eminent architect Capability Brown in 1775 to assume responsibility for the development. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780, giving the property a more romanticised appearance. During the Rebecca Riots of 1843, Colonel George Rice was awoken one night in September and found an empty grave dug in the grounds, warning <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be buried in it by October 10.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bhagavan cannot rest until he seeks out Jaidev for revenge. Firstly, Bhagavan kills Chotu (Ali), Jaidev's {{best friend and}} associate. Meanwhile, Sandhya gets kidnapped and taken to Kolkata. In a fit of rage at losing Chotu and Sandhya, Jaidev returns to Kolkata and starts hunting his rivals. He goes to Kulkarni's house with heavy {{ammunition}} and kills everyone except Kulkarni, as Jaidev promised <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not kill him. Kulkarni dies {{in his attempt to}} kill Jaidev. Later, Jaidev kills Guruvayya, as he gets information that Guruvayya was responsible for this saga. At last, Jaidev reaches Bhagavan, who actually kidnapped Sandhya.|$|E
5|$|Surya shifts his {{attention}} towards the upcoming Indian parliament elections and meets Guru Govind Patel, {{the head of}} the opposition party through Laalu. He makes a deal with him, offering 350 billion for election campaigning and also promises <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> make him the prime minister of India. Surya spends millions on every constituency in India, making Jai Dev unable to contest in the elections by revealing his illegal affairs. Jai Dev kidnaps Chitra to seek revenge on Surya, who fights with Jai Dev's henchmen. He is injured, but eventually kills Jai Dev, saving Chitra and proposing to her for the last time. It is revealed at the end that Surya successfully installed Guru Govind Patel as the Prime Minister of India.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> always be granted the liberty of his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus {{would allow him to}} amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E
5|$|With Burgers due {{to stand}} for {{re-election}} the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, {{and the idea of}} annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.|$|E
5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E

In his dream she made <b>him</b> promise <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not grieve, and he did so, wondering.

Then she spoke these words, always, as it appeared, within him, printing them, as it were, upon his mind: ...|$|R
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{then take}} their mercenaries {{in pursuit of}} Warwick's fleeing army, and ally with the French in the Seven Years' War against Warwick. When Colonel George Washington tells them that Warwick is a renegade and has been hunted by the British as well, John agrees to track him down for the British. John leads his mercenaries and Washington's forces and destroys Warwick's base in the Great Lakes region. The {{presence}} of the Circle of Ossus' Boneguard prove to John {{the existence of the}} Circle and that Warwick is the current Circle's leader. In the ruins of the Circle's base John finds the decapitated body of his uncle Stuart. John then demands that Nonahkee be kept at home while they pursue Warwick, who has again escaped and fled to the Rocky Mountains. Kanyenke agrees and reveals that he knows about John's relationship with Nonahkee. He tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts it because he knows that she decides who she loves.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Harvey was {{selected}} to play his only Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the injured Barnes. England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot. With {{only a few minutes}} of play left, the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run. Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive {{until the end of the}} day, rather than attack, and that the captain was angry with the resulting two wickets. According to Harvey, Bradman told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never be selected for Australia again. The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314. The target was not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley. The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1/215.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 2005, Trinidad competed against Winky Wright, {{in a fight}} {{where the}} winner would become the World Boxing Council's number one {{challenger}} in the Middleweight division. Wright won the fight by decision, receiving scores of 120–107 and 119–108 twice by the judges. Trinidad's fighting style appeared {{to be out of}} rhythm in the first round, while Wright presented a defensive stance and relied on jabs. During the first three rounds Wright was in the offensive scoring with jabs. On the fourth round Trinidad connected a solid combination. In the sixth, Wright continued the strategy used in the previous rounds while Trinidad employed a strategy where he tried to neutralize his opponent's punches by standing in front of him. In the later rounds Trinidad tried to take the contest's offensive but his adversary managed to block most of his punches while continuing his previous tactic. In the twelfth round Trinidad pursued Wright while trying to score a knockout, but his opponent boxed away from him until the round ended. Following this fight, Trinidad retired temporarily, after his father informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not continue in his corner.|$|E
