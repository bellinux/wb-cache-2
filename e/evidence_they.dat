5|$|Be Reasonable is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas {{outside the mainstream}} scientific consensus, such {{as a member of}} the Flat Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography and the presence of aliens on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) also takes nestlings, and {{powerful}} owl (Ninox strenua) {{has been recorded}} killing adults; other birds of prey are seen as threats, {{yet there is no}} <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) has been recorded as a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the <b>evidence,</b> <b>they</b> can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical <b>evidence.</b> <b>They</b> attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E

The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they try to tell of the <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E

5|$|Section D {{believes}} banker Alexis Meynell {{is trying}} to bankrupt the country. Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) asks the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gillian Calderwood (Selina Cadell) to freeze Meynell's assets, but is turned down {{due to lack of}} evidence. To get the <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> need, Ros is sent undercover to the London Stock Exchange, where Meynell is targeting the bank Highland Life. After starting a rumour about the bank, he starts betting against it. When the chairman of Highland Life, Francis Debham (Simon Williams), attempts to keep the bank afloat, Meynell doubles his position, bankrupting Highland Life. Ros uses the opportunity to swipe a memory card from Meynell's mobile phone, containing his secure email account that could prove his guilt. However, they find nothing relevant. Lucas North (Richard Armitage) relays this to Ros and tells her to get closer to Meynell.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial <b>evidence,</b> <b>they</b> note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The laws made {{separate}} {{provision for}} Ine's English and British subjects and were neither oppressive to the British nor completely even-handed. The <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> {{provide for the}} incomplete integration of the two populations is supported by research into placename history, the history of religious houses, and local archaeology, which indicates that {{the western part of}} Wessex was thinly settled by the Germanic newcomers at the time the laws were issued. It is notable that, although issued by the Saxon king of a Saxon kingdom, the term used in the laws to define Ine's Germanic subjects is Englisc. This reflects the existence, even at this early date, of a common English identity encompassing all the Germanic peoples of Britain.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, FGA gave {{evidence}} to the High Court {{in relation to the}} Yorta Yorta Native Title claim over areas in the Goulburn and Murray Valleys. The Yorta Yorta claim was over 200,000 km2 of land. The Yorta Yorta people gave <b>evidence</b> that <b>they</b> traditionally used the land to camp, hunt and fish. FGA gave <b>evidence</b> that <b>they</b> also traditionally use the land to camp hunt and fish.|$|R
5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} roles of various defense attorneys, {{including}} Phoenix Wright, his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, and investigates cases and defends their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor. In the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations, the player takes the role of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, and in the spin-off , they play as Phoenix's ancestor Ryūnosuke Naruhodō.|$|E
5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without <b>evidence,</b> <b>they</b> declined to pursue a case.|$|E

5|$|Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' {{cousin and}} driver shoot {{a woman and}} then use {{the threat of a}} long {{sentence}} to get him to wear a wire. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this <b>evidence</b> <b>they</b> obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.|$|E
