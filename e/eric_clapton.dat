5|$|A {{release date}} was planned for January or February 1973, with the album title rumoured to be The Light That Has Lighted the World. Within a month, {{the title was}} {{announced}} as The Magic Is Here Again, with an erroneous report in Rolling Stone magazine claiming that <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> was co-producing and that the album was set for release on 20 December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recording}} process, Duane {{was invited to}} join <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> and his new group Derek & the Dominos on {{the recording}} of their debut album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Clapton later formally invited Allman to join the group, but he reluctantly declined, expressing loyalty {{to the members of}} the Allman Brothers and musical concept that had birthed it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their 1969 debut, the Allman Brothers Band toured the United States {{extensively}} to promote the album, which had little commercial success. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth exposure that extended to more famous musicians, such as <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> who invited group leader Duane Allman to contribute to his 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.|$|E
5|$|Artists {{who have}} contributed to Bush's own albums include Elton John, <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, Danny Thompson, and Prince. Bush {{provided}} backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled Wouldn't Change a Thing by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album Out of the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{died from}} metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr {{were among the}} musicians who {{performed}} at the Concert for George, organised by <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event {{took place at the}} Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death. In addition to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career, the concert included a celebration of Indian classical music, which had significantly influenced Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Lenny Kravitz {{holds the}} record for the most wins in this category, with a total of four {{consecutive}} wins from 1999 to 2002. Bruce Springsteen has been presented the award three times, and two-time winners include <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> Bob Dylan, Don Henley, and Robert Palmer. Since its inception, American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians from the United Kingdom four times, from Australia once, and from South Africa once.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began at}} London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with {{extensive}} overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – {{as well as}} Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unissued.|$|E
5|$|The band {{released}} Blue & Lonesome on 2 December 2016. The album {{consisted of}} 12 blues covers of {{artists such as}} Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed and Little Walter. Recording took place in British Grove Studios, London, in December 2015, and featured <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> on two tracks. The album reached No.1 in the UK, the second-highest opening sales week for an album that year. It also debuted at No.4 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Jansch {{opened for}} Neil Young on his Twisted Road solo {{tour in the}} US and Canada, {{starting}} on 18 May 2010. He also performed at Eric Clapton's Crossroads festival in June 2010. These were Jansch's first shows since his illness. One of Bert's last recording sessions was with <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> for Paul Wassif's 2011 album Looking Up Feeling Down. In 2011, a few reunion gigs took place with Pentangle, including performances at the Glastonbury Festival and one final concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, which was also Jansch's last ever public performance.|$|E
5|$|The line-up {{of musicians}} {{on the basic}} track {{included}} Harrison and <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> on electric guitars; bassists Klaus Voormann and Carl Radle, one of whom plays six-string bass; and drummer Jim Gordon, who formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton and Radle during the sessions. In addition, Bobby Whitlock, the fourth member of the Dominos – {{all of whom were}} formerly part of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends – recalls playing Hammond organ on the song. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter note the presence of a piano part on the recording as well.|$|E
5|$|The musicians {{included}} Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Keys, Jim Price and Dave Mason, all of {{whom had}} recently toured with Delaney & Bonnie. Along with <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> there were also musicians whose link with Harrison went back some years, such as Ringo Starr and Billy Preston, and German bassist Klaus Voormann, formerly of Manfred Mann and a friend since the Beatles' years in Hamburg. Handling much of the keyboard work with Whitlock was Gary Wright, who went on to collaborate regularly with Harrison throughout the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The serial was re-issued on VHS in 1998 by Revelation Films {{who also}} issued the serial on DVD in 1999. In 2003, BBC Worldwide re-issued Edge of Darkness on DVD (encoded for both regions 2 and 4) with several extra {{features}} including Magnox: The Secrets of Edge of Darkness, a specially made “making-of” documentary; an isolated soundtrack of <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> and Michael Kamen's score; a Bob Peck interview from BBC Breakfast Time; a contemporary {{report on the}} programme's BAFTA wins and coverage of the programme's wins at the Broadcasting Press Guild awards. A Region 1 DVD set was released on 3 November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Banks used {{a number}} of {{keyboards}} during Genesis' career, continually trying out new models, though he used the piano regularly throughout the group's lifetime. In the 1970s, he frequently used the Hammond organ, Hohner Pianet, Mellotron, RMI Electronic Piano and ARP Pro Soloist. In the 1980s, he used the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 and Prophet 10, the ARP Quadra and various Korg synthesizers. For the Turn It On Again tour in 2007, his main board was a Korg Oasys. As both a guitarist and bassist, Rutherford regularly swapped between the two roles, and his trademark instrument with Genesis, particularly through the 1970s, was a double neck guitar. In the 1980s and beyond, he favoured the <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> Stratocaster.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{continued}} to play 70 to 100 one-nighters {{per year in the}} 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop. In 1986, Taylor Hackford made a documentary film, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, of a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by Keith Richards. <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> Etta James, Julian Lennon, Robert Cray and Linda Ronstadt, among others, appeared with Berry on stage and in the film. During the concert, Berry played a Gibson ES-355, the luxury version of the ES-335 that he favored on his 1970s tours. Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom, Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a , the same model that Berry used on his early recordings.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the album}} was {{conducted}} in a generally informal manner and took place at Electric Lady Studios simultaneously with recording for Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun (2000) and Common's Like Water for Chocolate (2000). This led to impromptu collaborations and a distinctive sound that is featured on the three albums. Frequent visits to the studio were made by fellow neo soul and hip hop recording artists associated with the Soulquarians collective such as Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, James Poyser, and Mos Def. Voodoos sessions also had visitors not associated with the project, including record producer Rick Rubin, comedian Chris Rock, and rock musician <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton.</b> D'Angelo previewed songs for them, which they found impressive.|$|E
5|$|Shankar's {{original}} {{hope was}} to raise $25,000 through a benefit concert of his own, compered perhaps by actor Peter Sellers. With Harrison's commitment, {{and the record}} and film outlets available to him through the Beatles' Apple Corps organisation, the idea soon grew to become a star-studded musical event, mixing Western rock with Indian classical music, and {{it was to be}} held at the most prestigious venue in America: Madison Square Garden, in New York City. According to Chris O'Dell, a music-business administrator and former Apple employee, Harrison got off the phone with Shankar once the concept had been finalised, and started enthusing with his wife, Pattie Boyd, and herself about possible performers. Ringo Starr, Lennon, <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Voormann, Billy Preston and Badfinger were all mentioned during this initial brainstorming.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 sequel, Blues Brothers 2000, {{had similar}} traits to the original, {{including}} large car-chase scenes and musical numbers. Landis returned {{to direct the}} film and Aykroyd reprised his role, joining John Goodman, Joe Morton, and 10-year-old J. Evan Bonifant as the new Blues Brothers. Franklin and Brown were among the celebrities returning from the first film. There were also musical performances by Sam Moore, Wilson Pickett, Paul Shaffer, B.B. King, and <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> among others. Dozens of artists were packed into an all-star band called The Louisiana Gator Boys. Even with many returning cast members, the film was considered a box-office failure, only generating a little over $14 million in sales, and critics' reactions were very poor.|$|E
5|$|The Concert for Bangladesh– {{originally}} titled The Concert for Bangla Desh– is a live triple album by George Harrison {{and celebrity}} friends, released on Apple Records in December 1971 in America and January 1972 in Britain. The album followed the two concerts {{of the same}} name, held on 1 August 1971 at New York's Madison Square Garden, featuring Harrison, Bob Dylan, Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton.</b> The shows were a pioneering charity event, in aid of the homeless Bengali refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, and set the model for future multi-artist rock benefits such as Live Aid (1985) and the Concert for New York City (2001).|$|E
5|$|Western Swing, {{a musical}} genre with roots in country music, was made popular at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom. The Tulsa Sound, a {{variation}} of rockabilly, blues, and rock 'n' roll, was started and largely developed by local musicians J. J. Cale and Leon Russell in the 1960s and 1970s. The Tulsa Sound heavily influenced musicians <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> and Jimmy Markham. Musicians from Tulsa or who started their musical careers in Tulsa include Garth Brooks, The Gap Band, Hanson, Caroline's Spine, Ronnie Dunn, Gene Autry, David Gates, Jamie Oldaker, Jim Keltner, Bob Wills, David Cook, Broncho, Tyson Meade, John Moreland, The Damn Quails, LANY, and JD McPherson. In 2012, Tulsa was ranked as {{having one of the}} best music scenes outside of New York, Los Angeles and Nashville.|$|E
5|$|American {{rock band}} Bon Jovi played the venue during the One Wild Night Tour in 2001. At {{the end of}} January 2005, the stadium hosted a tsunami relief concert in aid {{of the victims of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} and tsunami, with <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> headlining the event. The stadium has also been host to Madonna on two occasions, the first in July 2006 when she opened the UK leg of her Confessions Tour, and most recently in August 2008 when she kicked off her Sticky & Sweet Tour at the stadium. Other performers who have played at the stadium include Robbie Williams as part of his Weddings, Barmitzvahs & Stadiums Tour, U2 as part of their Vertigo Tour, Red Hot Chili Peppers as part of their By the Way tour, The Rolling Stones as part of their A Bigger Bang Tour, Bon Jovi as part of their One Wild Night Tour, R.E.M. as part of their Monster tour and again for their Around the Sun tour.|$|E
5|$|London has {{numerous}} venues for {{rock and}} pop concerts, including the world's busiest arena the O2 arena {{and other large}} arenas such as Earls Court, Wembley Arena, {{as well as many}} mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire. Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, South West Four, Lovebox, and Hyde Park's British Summer Time are all held in London. The city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where The Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, David Bowie, Queen, The Kinks, The Rolling Stones, The Who, <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton,</b> Led Zeppelin, The Small Faces, Iron Maiden, Fleetwood Mac, Elvis Costello, Cat Stevens, The Police, The Cure, Madness, The Jam, Ultravox, Spandau Ballet, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Adam Ant, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} covered {{several times in}} 1965, {{including}} a version by The Turtles on their album It Ain't Me Babe and a version by The Walker Brothers on their album Take It Easy with The Walker Brothers. Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any Day Now. A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman. <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Other musicians who have covered the song include Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, Bridget St. John, Eliza Gilkyson, and Les Fradkin.|$|E
5|$|Blues {{became a}} part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record {{companies}} launched the field of race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta blues musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont blues musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm & blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson. The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, {{as well as in the}} 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country blues musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or <b>Eric</b> <b>Clapton</b> are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E
