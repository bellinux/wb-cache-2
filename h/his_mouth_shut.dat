5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
500|$|The 1922 scandalous {{story in}} the Sunday Los Angeles Times by Scanland annoyed Earp. He was tired of all the lies perpetuated about him and became {{determined}} to get his story accurately told. Still, in 1924, a story in a San Francisco paper said interviewing him was [...] "like pulling teeth". Earp did not trust the press and preferred to keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Voyages of Discovery: A Manly Adventure in the Lands Down Under, a {{book about}} adventuring and masculinity, Ken Ewell {{described}} [...] "Maximum Homerdrive" [...] as a [...] "fine example" [...] of [...] "the poor man's lack of travel acumen". He wrote [...] "Homer's usual ineptitude at first spells disaster for the duo, at least until they {{find out about the}} truck's auto-drive system. And though he promises to keep the device a secret, Homer can't keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> and so shamefully exposes to the world his un-manful behavior concerning the mates. So given that Homer once again learns absolutely nothing from his traveling experience, he can only take to heart the thoughts of the British writer Stephen Fry. 'At my age travel broadens the behind.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Charlie didn't answer her. He {{walked along}} with <b>'is</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> <b>his</b> idea {{being that the}} least said the soonest mended. Even Emma asked 'im at last whether he 'ad lost 'is tongue, {{and said it was}} curious 'ow {{different}} love took different people.|$|R
500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, and now he is telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation and had the experience then he should keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> firmly shut." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1957, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Ford, then age 31, {{might not make}} the Browns' roster. Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. [...] When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. [...] Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. [...] Ford advised the rookie to keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: [...] "Run it your way {{in the game and}} hope it works, and if it does, don't say anything. Just make your yardage and act like it was a mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1902, the German {{government}} asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its {{dispute with}} Venezuela over unpaid debts. [...] Hay {{did not think}} this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. [...] Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, [...] "I have it all arranged. [...] If Teddy will keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> until tomorrow noon!" [...] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over {{the composition of the}} Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. [...] The commission was to be composed of [...] "impartial jurists" [...] and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. [...] Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. [...] Although Hay was supportive of the President's choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. [...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{publishing}} one of {{its most}} famous discoveries, Watson and Crick's 1953 [...] on the structure of DNA, Nature did not send the paper out for peer review. John Maddox, Natures editor, stated: [...] "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by Nature ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> once he saw the structure".|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{apparent}} missteps, his popularity grew {{from the time}} he took office, particularly among whites. In 1994, a survey for The Times-Picayune showed that 84% of Jefferson Parish residents had a favorable impression of the sheriff, including 91% of whites. The same poll showed that, while almost nine out of 10 people thought he [...] "tells it like it is", six of 10 thought he should sometimes keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in office, Hayden avoided {{publicity}} and speech making. Following his filibuster of Boulder Dam, Hayden did not make another speech from the Senate floor for 20 years. By his later years, many of his congressional colleagues had not heard him make a full speech. His avoidance of public speaking did not impair Hayden in his duties, with then Senator Lyndon B. Johnson saying [...] "He is living proof that effectiveness and statesmanship are not necessarily coupled with talkativeness" [...] and Arthur Edson of the Associate Press writing, [...] "He has kept <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> while astutely pushing out invisible tentacles of power".|$|E

60|$|His friend nodded. Tom {{took his}} cigar out of <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> to <b>shut</b> up <b>his</b> eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression, and to tap his nose several times with his finger.|$|R
60|$|Quashy opened <b>his</b> huge <b>mouth,</b> <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes, {{and went}} off in a high falsetto--his usual mode of laughing. He always laughed at Lawrence's little jokes, whether good or bad, insomuch that the youth finally abstained from jesting as much as possible.|$|R
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{also presented}} {{other pieces of}} circumstantial evidence linking Zach to the murder, including that he drove a white truck; a neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly {{the morning of the}} murder. A number of other witnesses testified that Zach made statements implicating himself in her disappearance. Zach's then-girlfriend, Rebecca Earp, testified that [...] "He said he would tie me up just like he did Holly Bobo and nobody would ever see me again." [...] He also allegedly threatened Dylan after his arrest that he would [...] "put him in a hole beside her" [...] if he didn't keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After the May 2014 {{military}} coup, Pravit and {{a fellow}} journalist, Thanapol Eawsakul, were summoned by the military on 23 May 2014. Before answering the summons, Pravit told the Thai media, [...] "I hope people will not give up the spirit and that General Prayuth {{will be the last}} dictator of Thailand". He was said to have added: [...] "They can detain me, but can never detain my conscience". He thereupon taped <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and put his hands over his ears. On the following day he went with a lawyer and representatives of the UN to the headquarters of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). He was questioned for five hours without his lawyer being present and was then taken to an unidentified detention center.|$|E
2500|$|Butkus sparked {{controversy}} in 1972 {{with the release}} of Stop-Action, a memoir describing the final week of the 1971 season. The Bears had lost their final five games in 1971, and Butkus used the memoir as an outlet to voice his frustrations and grievances. In particular, he harshly criticized the Lions organization, saying, [...] "I think they are a lot of jerks, from the owner, the general manager, the coach on down... If we were voting for a jerk team or organization they'd have my vote all the way." [...] The Lions responded with a 38–24 win over the Bears in Week 3 of 1972. After the game Lions linebacker Mike Lucci, whom Butkus had labeled a [...] "crybaby", denied that the book had any bearing on the game's outcome, but told reporters that [...] "Butkus should just keep <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and play football." [...] Butkus, who was notoriously cross with reporters, also denied the attribution and accused the media of sensationalism. Bears teammate Gale Sayers later said he did not like the book, feeling Butkus was above such name-calling. The season as a whole was another productive one for Butkus, who reclaimed the first-team middle linebacker spot on the major All-Pro teams and was invited to his final Pro Bowl.|$|E

60|$|But always {{his eyes}} had this strange, half-diabolic, half-tortured pale gleam, like a goat's, and <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> was <b>shut</b> almost uglily, his cheeks stern. His {{moustache}} was brown, his teeth strong and spaced. The women {{said it was a}} pity his moustache was brown.|$|R
