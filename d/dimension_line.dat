Dimensioning {{has long been a}} staple of technical drawings, and we present the first solution for interactive dimensioning: A <b>dimension</b> <b>line</b> positioning system that adapts to the view direction, given behavioral properties. After proposing a set of design principles for interactive dimensioning, we describe our solution consisting of the following major components. First, we describe how an author can specify the desired interactive behavior of a <b>dimension</b> <b>line.</b> Second, we propose a novel algorithm to place dimension lines at interactive speeds. Third, we introduce multiple extensions, including chained dimension lines, controls for different parameter types (e. g. discrete choices, angles), and the use of dimension lines for interactive editing. Our results show the use of dimension lines in an interactive parametric modeling environment for architectural, botanical, and mechanical models. © 2015 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2015 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Based {{on the latest}} advances, hyperspectral imaging is performed in one full spatial and one full spectral <b>dimension</b> (<b>line</b> spectral imaging). The generation of the 3 D dataset (called a spectral cube) is achieved by sample movement along a scanning platform, {{which is responsible for}} the second spatial dimension (Imspector from Specim, Linescan from imec). As a result, the acquired spectral cube contains a full spectrum at each image pixel, that, just like in reflectance spectroscopy, can be related to the sample’s surface material composition.|$|E
40|$|In an ERP experiment, we {{investigated}} whether a 'permanent salient distractor changes {{the deployment of}} attention to target and nontarget singletons. Observers searched for a color target in a search array that mainly consisted of black vertical lines, but also always contained a line in a task-irrelevant color. Together with this distractor, a target or nontarget singleton was presented. Nontargets could be salient on the task-relevant dimension (color), or on a neutral <b>dimension</b> (<b>line</b> orientation). N 2 pc amplitude was maximal for targets, no N 2 pc was elicited by color nontargets, and orientation nontargets elicited an inverse N 2 pc. Targets and color nontargets elicited larger N 2 amplitude than orientation singletons. P 3 amplitude was high for relevant and low for irrelevant singletons. Targets also elicited higher reaction times and more errors. Attention seemed thus driven by the target feature, and by its feature dimension, even when constant distraction on that dimension had to be suppressed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} R-trees and a variation (R+ - trees) that avoids overlapping rectangles in intermediate nodes of the tree. The main contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show how the transformation of objects to higher dimensions (first proposed by Hinrichs and Nievergelt [HINR 83]) can be effectively used {{as a tool for}} the analysis of R- and R+ -trees. Second, in this paper we provide the first known analysis of R-trees. Although formulas are given for objects in one <b>dimension</b> (<b>line</b> segments), they can be easily generalized for objects of higher dimensions as well. Finally, we derive formulas for R+ -trees and compare the two methods analytically. The results we obtained show that R+ -trees require less than half the disk accesses required by a corresponding R- tree when searching files of real life sizes. R+ -trees are clearly superior in cases where there are few long segments and a lot of small ones...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} several geometric {{methods for}} dividing an irregular mesh into pieces of roughly equal size with few interconnecting edges. All these methods {{are based on}} cutting a mesh with a line (in two dimensions) or a hyperplane (in any <b>dimension).</b> <b>Line</b> cuts have often been used in practice, but their quality varies widely. Until now, no theory has existed to predict the effectiveness of any line-cut algorithm. We make two main contributions: First, we give rigorous (and tight) bounds {{on the quality of}} line cuts for meshes of bounded aspect ratio in terms of a parameter we call grading that measures the nonuniformity of the mesh. Our bound on line cut quality differs from the known bound on circle cut quality by a factor that grows only as the 1 =d power of the logarithm of the mesh grading. Second, we give an upper bound on the quality of an exact 50 : 50 line cut. This is the first proof of a cut size guarantee for any exact bisection induced by a single geometric cut.

This means that each one of population-based algorithms will try to optimize the problem by concentrating on the dimensions assigned to it. LSHADE-SPA will start this procedure working on one-third of the dimensions.
