5000|$|The {{threat of}} toxics {{bioaccumulation}} is especially high in sturgeon meat. Because of its eating habits, sturgeon accumulate toxins in their flesh as they feed. They feed on {{any sort of}} organic material found while scavenging; this includes raw sewage, dead <b>fish,</b> <b>paper</b> mill wastes, and plants sprayed by pesticides. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are unintentional byproducts of paper bleaching and pesticides. It {{is also one of}} the most commonly found toxics in fish populations. PCB is also found in fish. It is used as a plasticizer in paint, rubber, and plastic products. Before the government ceased its production in 1977, more than 1,500,000,000 pounds (680,000 tonnes) were produced. Methylmercury is one of the more commonly known toxics found in fish's flesh. Some have speculated that it is also the most dangerous. Sturgeon and other fish in the Columbia and Willamette Rivers have registered 0.05 to 0.50 parts per million. Although most accumulation in sturgeon happens in the liver, pancreas, and other organs, the toxics still accumulate in the edible flesh. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has issued warnings on all fish caught in the Willamette River. [...] "Women of childbearing age, children under six, and people with liver and kidney damage should avoid eating fish from these waters. Healthy adults should eat no more than one eight ounce meal per month". Also for areas with high concentrations of PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides: [...] "All persons should reduce or avoid eating fatty parts of fish. Exposure can be reduced by removing the skin and all fat, eggs, and internal organs".|$|E
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{interactions}} of animals with the environment and each other. The thesis was written {{within the framework of}} a biomanipulation project “Pikeperch in Himmerfjärden”. With the aim to investigate possible trophic pit-falls, give the manipulation the best possible start, and find ways to monitor the progression of the manipulation. In Paper I the diet of the invader cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi is analysed with stable isotopes; conducted prior to stocking. C. pengoi has a preference for large copepods, indicating possible competition with <b>fish.</b> <b>Paper</b> II investigates the behavioural differences between pikeperch fingerlings reared in different environments (pond vs. tank). Results suggest that fish reared in semi-natural ponds are more likely to survive directly after stocking. In Paper III and IV, the diel vertical migrations (DVM) of copepods are in focus. In Paper III the migrations of two copepod species: Acartia spp. and Eurytemora affinis are studied over season and life stage. The amplitude of migration was found to increase with ontogeny for both species, indicating evasion of visual predators. Paper IV examines the varying migratory patterns of adult female E. affinis finding that these animals migrate more actively when feeding conditions deteriorate and growth decreases. The overall conclusions of the thesis are that behavioural, not only direct trophic interactions are key when studying ecosystems.

40|$|Although rather {{inconspicuous}} on healthy coral reefs, macroalgae {{form the}} basis of coral food webs. Today, macroalgae are generally increasing and many reefs undergo transitions from coral to macroalgal dominance resulting from e. g. enhanced nutrient loading or increased fishing. This thesis aims to investigate the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up regulation, and different herbivore types, on macroalgal distribution, fecundity and community composition on coral reefs. Papers I and II indicate that macroalgal abundance in a coral reef system is largely governed by top-down regulation through grazing by herbivores, while bottom-up regulation through enhanced nutrient availability rather influence algal species composition. Paper II also shows that these regulating effects are not as evident in an area with relatively strong water motion, suggesting that impacts of anthropogenic disturbance may be site-specific. Paper III shows that herbivory is an important factor influencing macroalgal growth and subsequent reproduction. Furthermore, Paper IV and V conclude that efficiency in removing macroalgal biomass is dependent on the type of dominant herbivore, where sea urchins seem to be more effective than <b>fish.</b> <b>Paper</b> IV indicates a seasonal variation in macroalgal biomass and distribution in a small geographic scale but with relatively high temporal resolution. Paper V on the other hand shows these same effects, but with a focus on geographic variation, including {{a large part of the}} East African region, as well as between year temporal variations in Kenya. Together, results from the two latter studies indicate that herbivory by fish may not be able to prevent a macroalgal bloom in a degraded system where substrate availability for algal colonization is high, but that it may still facilitate coral recovery over time. Thus, a large algal biomass may not necessarily indicate a reef beyond the possibility of recovery.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} study was to {{elucidate}} selective environmental up-take processes in Arctic food webs that lead to the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POP) in food items consumed by Arctic indigenous people. In addition, this study aimed to increase the scientific understanding of the principles behind climate change related influences on transport processes of contaminants. Svalbard and Nuuk, Greenland were chosen as study areas since they represent Arctic conditions, e. g. glaciers, different marine water masses, long-range transport of POPs and few local sources of POPs. In addition, Greenland has a large population of indigenous people consuming traditional food on a daily basis. This thesis is based on field campaigns and empirical data. Legacy pesticides were analysed in water samples from a Greenlandic fjord (paper I). The pesticide distribution indicated that glaciers and snow caps around the fjord are secondary sources of contaminants for the coastal marine environment. Chlordanes were identified as potential indicator compounds for meltwater runoff (paper I). α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), trans-, cis- and oxychlordane were chosen for enantiomer selective analyses in zooplankton from Svalbard and Greenlandic traditional food items (paper II, III). The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of α-HCH in the zooplankton was associated to ice cover/break-up. EFs of cis-chlordane were reflected in the deviation from racemic EF among oxychlordane. Chiral pesticides and enantiomer selective analyses are recommended for further studies regarding their potential as marker for changes of the physical environment (paper II). Non-racemic EFs were detected for almost all food samples. Hence, species specific distribution exists, and can be an important factor in future dietary advices. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) and pesticides were below tolerable daily intake threshold in the food items (paper III, IV).

40|$|The {{identification}} and classification of bacteria was initially performed with morphological methods applied on cultivated bacteria. It {{was not until}} the mid 1970 s, when sequences of ribosomal RNA were discovered to be useful for bacterial evolution, that a new era started. This method showed to be far more accurate for bacterial identification. Today, identification of bacteria is totally dominated with 16 S rRNA genes and the old methods based on morphology have been left behind with the exception of new species definitions. Later, in the mid 1980 s the usefulness of the 16 S rRNA gene for identification was further improved when the cloning approach was introduced. Cloning makes it possible to detect and identify non-cultivable and dead bacteria from all kinds of ecological nisches. The identification by the 16 S rRNA genes from isolated and cloned bacteria from the food hygiene aspect proved to be very important revealing unknown members of the bacterial flora. As demonstrated in paper I, the method does not always result in a certain {{identification and}} thus other complementory methods have to be applied. A Yersinia high pathogenicity island was found in a meat isolate most closely related to the type strain of Serratia liquefaciens. However, the identification of the meat isolate was not achieved until the complementary method ribotyping was applied. To evaluate the bacterial composition of fresh and spoiled meat and <b>fish</b> (<b>paper</b> II and III) two complementory approaches cultivation and cloning were conducted in parallel. Evidently, the true composition of the mentioned bacterial floras can not be determined solely by either of the methods. Cloning was applied on human mesenteric lymph nodes to detect translocated cultivable, non-cultivable and dead bacteria. The translocated bacteria (paper IV) was difficult to reveal with cloning hence the low amount of bacteria present. When the bacterial load is small, as in a lymph node, contaminating bacterial DNA from e. g. chemical reagents bias the actual results rendering them uncertain. In conclusion, the present doctoral thesis has investigated identification by the 16 S rRNA gene of bacterial isolates and clones from meat, fish and human mesenteric lymph nodes. Occasionally, an identification can not be determined solely with the 16 S rRNA gene and therefore other molecular based methods are needed...|$|E
40|$|Blooms of {{nitrogen}} fixing cyanobacteria (NFC) occur in many freshwater and marine systems, including the Baltic Sea. By fixing dissolved nitrogen, they circumvent general summer nitrogen limitation, while also generating {{a supply of}} novel bioavailable nitrogen for non-diazotrophic primary producers and ultimately supporting secondary production. Elucidating trophic links between primary consumers and NFC is essential for understanding role of these blooms for secondary production. However, until recently, there was no reliable method to quantify individual prey species for zooplankter feeding in situ. The development of PCR-based methods to detect prey-specific DNA in the diet of consumers, including microscopic animals, allows identification and quantification of trophic linkages in the field. Using molecular diet analysis in combination with egg production measurements, biochemical markers of growth and condition; and stable isotope approach, we explored a possibility to determine (1) whether cyanobacteria are grazed and assimilated by mesozooplankters (Papers I and II), (2) which species/groups are particularly efficient consumers of cyanobacteria (Papers II and III), and (3) how feeding on cyanobacteria affects zooplankton growth and development (Paper I and III). Taken together, these laboratory and field observations, provided evidence that NFC contribute to feeding and reproduction of zooplankton during summer and create a favorable growth environment for the copepod nauplii (Paper I). The favorable growth conditions for juvenile copepods observed during NFC blooms were hypothesized to be mediated by picoplankton that take up bioavailable nitrogen exuded from cyanobacterial cells. This hypothesis found support in Paper II that provided quantitative estimates for the direct picocyanobacteria → mesozooplankton pathway, with highest weight-specific consumption observed in nauplii. Further, using field observations on zooplankton and phytoplankton development during a growth season in the northern Baltic proper, we found that NFC nitrogen is assimilated and transferred to zooplankton via both direct grazing and indirectly through grazing on small-sized phyto- and bacterioplankton (Paper III). Finally, these and other findings emphasizing the importance of NFC for Baltic Sea secondary production during growth season were synthesized to show that diazotrophic nitrogen enters food webs already at bloom initiation (Paper III) and is transferred via multiple pathways to pelagic and benthic food webs and, ultimately, to <b>fish</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV).

40|$|Thiamine (vitamin B 1) is {{involved}} in several basal metabolic processes. It is an essential compound for many organisms and in aquatic systems it is mainly produced by phytoplankton and prokaryotes and transferred to higher trophic levels through grazing and predation. The occurrence of thiamine deficiency in top predators has been reported from several aquatic systems. In the Baltic populations of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) this has been observed since 1974 and recently thiamine deficiency has also been reported for Baltic sea birds. This thesis aims at investigating what processes that governs the flow of thiamine from the primary producers to top predators via zooplankton grazers and planktivoric <b>fish.</b> <b>Paper</b> I showed that abiotic stress factors such as salinity, temperature and light conditions can alter the thiamine content of phytoplankton. Paper II showed that abiotic factors indirectly can affect the stress resistance of zooplankton grazers by changing the nutritional quality of their food. In Paper III {{we found that the}} in situ thiamine content of zooplankton grazers was directly affected by that of the phytoplankton diet. In Paper IV we found a similar connection between the thiamine contents of Baltic salmon and herring, one of the major salmon prey species. In Paper V we looked at the thiamine content of the pelagic food web of the Baltic Sea as a whole and found a pattern of trophic dilution; the higher the trophic level of an organism (i. e. the further away from the source of thiamine in the food web), the lower was its thiamine content. In all, the results of this thesis suggests a bottom up effect on the thiamine status of the higher trophic levels of  the Baltic Sea and that external factors, both natural and man-made, have the capability to affect the thiamine status of the plankton communities and thereby the whole Baltic ecosystem. Thiamine and other micronutrients are not something generally considered in the environmental management of aquatic systems but the results of this thesis suggest that ecological disturbances indirectly can have negative effects on top predators via a disrupted supply of essential substances.

40|$|Coral reefs {{have one}} of the highest levels of {{biodiversity}} of all ecosystems in the world and are important for both human livelihood and food security throughout many tropical countries. However, due to increased anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems, especially during the last couple of decades, coral reefs have become critically over-fished, and many reefs are now in a degraded state and are facing additional future threats due to further over-exploitation, chemical pollution, sedimentation, and effects of climate change. The main aim of this PhD thesis was to understand effects of anthropogenic disturbances on tropical coastal ecosystems and fish connectivity for coastal management purposes. Therefore, linkages between anthropogenic disturbance and corals were investigated (Paper I), as well as interactions between coral reef habitat and associated fish assemblage (Paper II). Furthermore, connectivity between coral reefs and other tropical coastal ecosystems was explored (Paper III), as well as fish migration to reproduction sites (Paper IV), and evaluations of spatial ecology methods (Paper V). The result showed that coral reefs that are already exposed to disturbances, such as freshwater and nutrient run-offs, may be more sensitive to climate change, in terms of increased sea surface temperatures (Paper I). In addition, there were also clear linkages between coral reef quality, in terms of coral coverage, and fish assemblages, which displayed high spatial variability and suggesting patchy recovery after the 1997 / 1998 bleaching and subsequent coral mass mortality event (Paper II). This highlights the importance of understanding effects of disturbances on corals, especially in terms of synergistic effects between increased water temperatures and other coastal stressors such as decreased salinity and increased nutrients; and the indirect effects of habitat degradation on the fish community. Linkages between fish and different coastal habitats were further explored. The results showed that coral reefs were strongly connected with mangrove and seagrass beds, through ontogenetic migration of <b>fish</b> (<b>Paper</b> III). Migrations to spawning sites of groupers were related to lunar activities when thousands of fish gather for reproduction purposes during new moon, which increases the risk of over-exploitation (Paper IV). The results emphasises the importance of protecting key areas such as nursing grounds and reproduction sites. Furthermore, acoustic telemetry has become an increasingly common method in studies of fish movement, and the results showed that efficiency of acoustic arrays may increase depending on deployment strategies and habitat characteristics (Paper V). In conclusion, the results from this PhD thesis emphasises the importance of protecting coral reef habitats, as well as identifying related susceptible tropical coastal areas, such as nursing grounds and reproduction sites. Indeed, a better scientific understanding of coral reef ecology and indirect and direct effects on fish assemblages are needed for efficient and accurate coastal management decisions.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder with pathologies such as neuron loss, glial cell proliferation, extracellular deposition of senile plaques from {{the accumulation of}} amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and deposition of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Aβ is created from the cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by {{two different types of}} aspartyl proteases, β- and γ-secretase. The majority of AD cases are sporadic and have a late onset. Mutations in the genes encoding APP, PRESENILIN 1 and 2 (PSEN 1 and PSEN 2) genes cause an autosomal dominant inherited form of the disease with an early onset known as familial AD. In some sporadic cases an aberrant splice variant of PSEN 2 named PS 2 V is formed that can be found in inclusion bodies in the brain. PS 2 V results from the binding of the High Mobility Group A 1 a (HMGA 1 a) protein close to the splice donor site of exon 5 of PSEN 2. The High Mobility Group A 1 protein,HMGA 1, is widely expressed during embryo development but not in adults. Its expression can be induced in adult neurons by hypoxia/oxidative stress and it is commonly reactivated in many types of cancer. Hypoxia can be a direct consequence of hypoperfusion, a common vascular component among Alzheimer’s disease risk factors and may {{play an important role in}} AD pathogenesis. BETA-SITE AMYLOID BETA A 4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN-CLEAVING ENZYME 1, BACE 1 is responsible, with γ-secretase, for cleavage of AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN, APP to produce Aβ peptide. A recent study observed that oxidative stress upregulates BACE 1 expression via a regulatory pathway that is dependent on γ-secretase cleavage of APP and that results in increased Aβ peptide production. In this thesis, we define strategies for exposure of zebrafish to hypoxia and “chemical hypoxia”. We identifiyendogenous zebrafish hmga 1 in an attempt to investigate PS 2 V formation in fish. We also demonstrate that responses to low oxygen/oxidative stress by genes involved in Alzheimer’s disease are evolutionarily conserved in <b>fish.</b> <b>Paper</b> 1 (thesis chapter in the form of a manuscript) describes the identification of the hmga 1 gene in zebrafish which is an orthologue of human HMGA 1. It also examines the regulation of this gene under hypoxia/oxidative stress conditions and demonstrates thathmga 1 expression is induced under these conditions. However no PS 2 V-like splice variant of zebrafish psen 2 is observed. Paper 2 (thesis chapter in the form of a manuscript) describes the identification of the zebrafish bace 1 gene which is orthologous to human BACE 1. It also examines the regulation of AD-related genes under hypoxia/oxidative stress. We show that the response of the BACE 1 -PSEN-APPregulatory axisto hypoxia/oxidative stress is evolutionarily conserved between fish and mammals. Therefore, we also demonstrate that zebrafish are a valid model system for analysis of the effects of hypoxia/oxidative stress on genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Thesis (M. Sc.)

40|$|Fisheries {{agencies}} {{around the}} Baltic Sea use hydroacoustics to assess stock sizes of herring and sprat. These assessments {{rely on the}} assumption that the acoustic properties of Baltic clupeids are the same as North Sea herring. This may lead to biased results, as system-specific differences in salinity and fish fat content may influence acoustic target strength. The acoustic properties of the Baltic clupeids were explored and a new relationship between target strength and fish length was developed (paper I). The intercept of this new relationship is 3. 4 dB higher than normally used by the agencies. Applying this new relationship would reduce the acoustic stock biomass estimates by approximately 50 %. Diel variation in the vertical distribution of fish may influence acoustic abundance estimates. Fish body posture may influence target strength and if fish concentrate near the surface or bottom this may affect detectability by an echo sounder. A seabed-mounted, upward pinging echo sounder was used to study diel variation in vertical distribution, acoustic size distribution and abundance of <b>fish</b> (<b>Paper</b> II). Differences between day and night were substantial and it was concluded that night time acoustics are to be preferred, at least in our study area. The seabed-mounted echo sounder was also used to study fish swimming activity and vertical distribution in relation to light intensity and water temperature (paper III). Four phases of fish distribution were distinguished over the diel cycle (day, night, dawn and dusk). Acoustic tracking was used to estimate the swimming speed of individual fish. The speed varied among the diel periods and the greatest difference was observed between day and night with twice as high swimming speed during the day. Regression models were developed to investigate the effects of fish size and environmental factors (water temperature, light intensity at the sea surface and in situ, measured at the depth of the fish) on swimming speed. Fish size, light intensities and temperature were all significant variables in the models, with fish size being generally most important. These results have clear implications for fish bioenergetics models. Such models should account for seasonal, light-driven cycles in the activity-induced respiration estimates, in particular when modelling populations at high latitudes. Vertical and horizontal fish distributions were studied from spring through autumn during two consecutive years (paper IV). The seasonal dynamics in vertical distribution patterns were consistent between years. Prior to thermocline formation, fish of all sizes concentrated near surface where water temperatures were higher than in the underlying water mass. During the summer period of pronounced thermal stratification, larger fish were found deeper than small individuals (including young-of-the-year fish), which remained close to the surface. In the autumn, when the thermal stratification diminished, the small fish moved somewhat deeper while larger individuals dispersed throughout the water column. Fish showed clear horizontal patchiness, but horizontal distributions were not significantly related to wind directions...|$|E
40|$|In recent time {{breast cancer}} {{has become the}} most common form of female cancer in the western world. It has been {{estimated}} that the lifetime risk of women falling ill from the disease is 10 %. The number of patients diagnosed each year has been increasing steadily since the 1970 s. In 2002 the number of Swedish women diagnosed with breast cancer was 6, 600, constituting every third female cancer diagnosed. Little is known about the order of appearance of different types of genetic aberrations, how they relate to each other, what their role is in the defining the clinical outcome of the patient, and which aberrations underlie therapy resistance. A comparative study between cytogenetics and CGH was conducted in 29 invasive breast cancers (paper I). The differences seen in the comparison of cytogenetic and CGH karyotyping can best be explained by the difficulties of culturing breast carcinoma cells in vitro. The gains and losses found by CGH may represent the predominant (often aneuploid) clone, whereas the G-banding karyotypes represents minor abnormal, near-diploid cell clone(s), which, for unknown reasons, has a growth advantage in short term culture. To explore the order of appearance of genetic aberrations in a direct manner, tumor cells from 21 non-diploid breast carcinomas were sorted for their DNA content by flow cytometry, and then analyzed separately by <b>FISH</b> (<b>paper</b> II). Data from these uncultured interphase cells showed that oncogene amplification, which is biologically and prognostically a very important genetic defect in breast cancer, takes place already before aneuploidization. The simultaneous presence of diploid and non-diploid malignant cells is also a clear indication of heterogeneity in the genetic composition of breast carcinoma. In order to shed light on how copy number aberrations (CNA) patterns are composed, a CGH analysis of 305 breast cancer tumors was conducted (paper III). Two different statistical approaches were able to identify the exact same CNA pattern groups, indicating that the groups are true biological entities, rather than reflection of the statistical modeling technique used. These different groups were correlated to distinct clinicopathological features and patient prognosis, and could predict patient outcome just as well as the traditional prognostic factors. In paper IV, characterization of the new and intrinsically Herceptin® resistant cell line JIMT- 1, revealed an aberration pattern characteristic for aggressive breast cancers. Molecular cytogenetic techniques revealed numerous regions of CNA. Many of the genes in the aberrant regions are implicated in cancer development and drug/hormone metabolizing. In conclusion, the results from the studies presented herein, indicate that the genetic aberrations of breast cancer are complex, and not detected by conventional cytogenetic techniques. Implementation of molecular cytogenetic techniques in a large breast cancer material, identified specific patterns of aberrations, and these patterns are linked to patient prognosis. Characterization of a Herceptin® resistant cell line by use of microarray techniques revealed amplification and upregulation of several genes that are linked to the promotion of breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} is {{a sudden}} {{inflammation of the}} pancreas. It has {{a broad spectrum of}} clinical outcomes, ranging from mild and self-limiting to severe and potentially fatal, and is often followed by recurrent attacks and/or progression to a chronic disease state (so-called chronic pancreatitis); especially if it is classified as non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. Alcohol abuse is considered {{to be the most important}} risk factor for non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. Even though dietary factors also might be risk factors, the literature on the role of diet in the development, recurrence, and progression of non- gallstone-related acute pancreatitis is sparse. A total of 5 studies were included in this thesis, for which the specific aims were to study: (Paper I) the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with incidence (first occurrence) of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis; (Paper II) the association between glycemic load (a measure that combines quantity and quality of carbohydrates) and incidence of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis; (Paper III) the association between fish consumption and incidence of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis; (Paper IV) the association between coffee drinking and incidence of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis; and (Paper V) the association between overall diet quality and risk of recurrent and progressive pancreatic disease after an incident episode of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis. In the incidence studies (Paper I–IV) —which used data from a large group of Swedish men and women who had completed a food-frequency questionnaire in 1997 (study samples ranging from 71, 458 to 81, 100 persons), and who were followed up for a maximum of 12 to 15 years via linkage to national health registers—I observed that incidence of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis (study samples ranging from 320 to 383 cases) had an inverse association (lower risk) with consumption of vegetables (Paper I) and <b>fish</b> (<b>Paper</b> III), a positive association (higher risk) with consumption of high-glycemic load foods (Paper II), and a null association with consumption of fruit (Paper I) and coffee (Paper IV). In the recurrence and progression study (Paper V) —which used data on the 386 persons who had been diagnosed with incident non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis between 1998 and 2013, and who were subsequently followed up until the end of 2014 (mean follow-up of 4. 8 years) —I observed no clear association between overall diet quality (calculated using a recommended food score, which was based on 25 healthy food items) and risk of recurrent and progressive pancreatic disease (defined as recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis and/or incident episodes of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer; study sample of 90 cases). Taken together, these findings suggest that diet, a previously overlooked factor, might be important in the primary prevention of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis—and as such, they uniquely contribute to the existing literature on the role of diet in health promotion and disease prevention. On the other hand, the findings are less supportive of an important role of diet in the secondary prevention of non-gallstone- related acute pancreatitis (ie, as a potential way to reduce recurrence and progression), at least for the overall diet quality; even though a role of individual food items and nutrients cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{behavioural}} dynamics of mesopelagic fish in a fjordic environment. Acoustic data recorded with a stationary echosounder was used to primarily investigate the diel vertical migration behaviour of the mesopelagic fish Maurolicus muelleri. Particular emphasis was {{on the effect of}} daily and seasonal changes in surface light irradiance and the vertical distribution of large predator-like fish on M. muelleri. In addition the behaviour of the deeper distributed mesopelagic lantern fish Benthosema glaciale and large, individual fish were also investigated. Diel vertical migrations (DVM) are vital in maintaining the energy flow in marine ecosystem food webs, and migrating organisms thus directly and indirectly provide food/nourishment to many non migrating animals. Typically, DVM are characterised by an ascent to surface waters from deeper day time depths at dusk, followed by a nocturnal period close to the surface and a subsequent descent to daytime depths at dawn. M. muelleri and B. glaciale are abundant and ecologically important fish in several marine systems. They are part of the mesopelagic animal community that performs DVM - nature’s largest migration in terms of biomass. In the Norwegian Sea and fjords M. muelleri forms acoustically visible scattering layers (SLs), while the deeper living B. glaciale appears acoustically more scattered and less dense, not aggregating in distinct SLs. Both species are challenged with seasonally changing gradients of environmental variables including light, temperature, salinity, food abundance and piscivorous predators. Although several aspects of the behaviour and biology of M. muelleri {{and to a lesser extent}} of B. glaciale have been studied, our knowledge of short term and seasonal variation of individual fish and SL behaviour, as well as behavioural responses to seasonal changes in surface light irradiance and predator distribution is limited. To address these shortcomings we therefore utilised the fairly recent developments of stationary echosounder assemblages, located on fjord bottoms, which made it possible to collect continuous acoustic records of the entire water column over a 15 month period. Here I present 4 papers covering the description of a stationary acoustic platform and its application in studying the temporal and spatial behavioural dynamics of B. glaciale individuals and layers as well as large individual <b>fish</b> (<b>Paper</b> 1), the monthly and seasonal variations in DVM behaviour of M. muelleri SL (Paper 2), the relationship between daily and monthly changes in surface light intensity and M. muelleri SL depth (Paper 3), and the vertical distribution of M. muelleri SL in relation to seasonally changing predator distribution (Paper 4). By collecting continuous acoustic data with an upward facing split beam echosounder located on the fjord bottom it was possible to observe biotic changes in the water column within the course of days, weeks, and months (Paper 1 - 4), as well as investigate the vertical distribution and swimming behaviour of individual fish by applying a target strength threshold and target tracking (Paper 1 and 3). Paper 1 specifically describes the reverse diel migrations during day time of the deeper distributed (> 200 m) lanternfish B. glaciale and its swimming behaviour, which was mostly passive and more active during stepwise vertical excursions. Paper 1 also deals with depth related differences in large fish swimming behaviour and target strength. Shallower distributed large fish ( 300 m). Paper 2 reports on novel behaviours of M. muelleri ontogenetic layers; early morning ascents, reverse diel migrations, and arrested migrations. Previous studies have shown that juvenile M. muelleri perform midnight sinking, i. e. the relocation to deeper waters after dusk, in January in addition to ordinary DVM between January and June. Adult fish on the other hand do not display DVM in January, and stayed in deep waters throughout the diel period, while migrating vertically between the surface and deeper day time depths in spring (May and June). In addition to these previous observations we found that a proportion of ascending juvenile M. muelleri arrested their migration between January and April. Further, adult fish displayed early morning ascents to the surface (in the absence of light) in September and October, and reverse migrations in November until January by migrating approximately 20 - 30 m upwards at dawn instead of descending. Adult fish ‘overwintered’ for approximately 6 months, whereas younger fish displayed midnight sinking between August and beginning of May. Paper 2 also demonstrated that when three SLs were present, the shallowest SL was composed of post-larvae 10 mm long. The observed behavioural patterns are interpreted as responses to individual physiological state, hunger-satiation and condition, prey availability and predation risk at alternative depths. Light affects many aspects of fish behaviour. The preferendum hypothesis states that organism change their depth during DVM because they follow a constant light level, i. e. an isolume. In Paper 3 the upper border depth of M. muelleri SLs was positively, linearly correlated to surface irradiance, which could suggest that M. muelleri follows an isolume. However, this assumes an invariant light attenuation coefficient. On the contrary we found that the light intensity of the isolume was not constant. It tended to vary with migration phase, whether fish were ascending or descending and it also changed with month. We therefore suggest that M. muelleri follow a preferred light range instead of a strict isolume, which reflects a more dynamic relationship. Differences in preferred light range also appear to be related to ontogeny and physiological state. In paper 4 we applied target tracking to study the depth distribution of large, putative predatory fish. High numbers of predator-like fish at the surface at night during autumn and winter month, October – March, appear to cause juvenile M. muelleri to relocate deeper after dusk in order to avoid these predators. However, juveniles continued to decent at dawn in autumn and winter months despite the absence of pelagic daytime predators at this time. This suggests that M. muelleri has an innate (genetically fixed) behavioural response synchronised with the light cycle and triggered by a change in surface light intensity. The presence of high numbers of predators in shallow waters between dawn and dusk may explain why M. muelleri avoided the shallow waters at day time in spring and summer months. An increasingly deeper daytime distribution of predator-like fish in the course of summer may also have influenced the vertical distribution especially of the deeper SLs. The overall findings in this thesis show that vessel independent acoustic observation platforms are well suited to detect and observe both short term and seasonal changes in the behaviour of both layers of fish and individuals. By combining acoustic data with environmental, biological and catch data, I have shown that the DVM behaviour of mesopelagic individuals and SLs is much more complex than previously believed, with fish displaying hitherto undescribed temporally varying behavioural patterns. My studies corroborate and supplement the current understanding of ecological interactions and processes that persist in fjordic environments. Behavioural aspects of M. muelleri have been used to model responses to environmental constraints and the life history of this species, and results presented in this thesis thus have the potential to improve such models. Due to their vital role as prey for commercially exploited fish species in marine ecosystems, mesopelagic fish species have in recent years been the focus of acoustic surveys to estimate their abundance and determine their distribution. A better understanding of their behaviour can aid in improving such estimates and contribute to the improved ecosystem based management of marine resources...|$|E
