5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested.|$|E
5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E

5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|Water {{has several}} {{systematic}} names, including oxidane (the IUPAC name), hydrogen oxide, and dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO). The latter {{was the basis}} of the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, a document that was circulated warning readers of the dangers of the chemical (for example, it is fatal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled).</b>|$|E
25|$|SnF2 {{can cause}} redness and {{irritation}} <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or comes {{into contact with}} the eyes. At acute levels (over 2mg/m3), if ingested, it can cause abdominal pains and shock. Rare but serious allergic reactions are possible (symptoms include itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing). When used in dental products, mild tooth discoloration may also occur; this can be removed by brushing.|$|E

6000|$|The dreamy {{warmth in}} Don Ippolito's deep eyes kindled to a flame; a dark red glowed in his thin cheeks; {{he drew a}} box from the folds of his drapery and took snuff in a great whiff, as <b>if</b> <b>inhaling</b> the {{sulphurous}} fumes of battle, or titillating his nostrils with grains of gunpowder. He was at least in full enjoyment of the poetic power of his invention, and no doubt had before his eyes a vivid picture of a score of secessionists surprised and blown to atoms in the very moment of triumph. [...] "Behold, Signor Console!" [...] he said.|$|R

25|$|In {{humidity}} indicator cards (HICs), cobalt-free brown to azure (copper(II) chloride base) HICs can {{be found}} on the market. In 1998, the European Community (EC) classified items containing cobalt(II) chloride of 0.01 to 1% w/w as T (Toxic), with the corresponding R phrase of R49 (may cause cancer <b>if</b> <b>inhaled).</b> As a consequence, new cobalt-free humidity indicator cards have been developed that contain copper.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{hexavalent}} uranium compounds, UO3 is hazardous by inhalation, ingestion, {{and through}} skin contact. It is a poisonous, slightly radioactive substance, which may cause shortness of breath, coughing, acute arterial lesions, {{and changes in}} the chromosomes of white blood cells and gonads leading to congenital malformations <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> However, once ingested, uranium is mainly toxic for the kidneys and may severely affect their function.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{drinking}} bird's appearance and classification as a toy {{there is a}} potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is nonflammable. Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.|$|E

25|$|Many {{solvents}} {{can lead}} to a sudden loss of consciousness <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in large amounts. Solvents like diethyl ether and chloroform have been used in medicine as anesthetics, sedatives, and hypnotics for a long time. Ethanol (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused psychoactive drug. Diethyl ether, chloroform, and many other solvents (e.g. from gasoline or glues) are used recreationally in glue sniffing, often with harmful long term health effects like neurotoxicity or cancer. Fraudulent substitution of 1,5-pentanediol for the psychoactive 1,4-butanediol by a subcontractor caused the Bindeez product recall.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{is harmful}} <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> {{swallowed}} or absorbed through the skin. Effects of acute pyridine intoxication include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, {{and loss of}} appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. One person died after accidental ingestion of {{half a cup of}} pyridine. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500mg·kg−1. In high doses, pyridine has a narcotic effect and its vapor concentrations of above 3600ppm pose a health risk. The oral LD50 in rats is 891mg·kg−1. Pyridine is flammable.|$|E
25|$|Oxalic acid in {{concentrated}} form {{can have}} harmful effects through contact and if ingested; manufacturers provide details in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). It is not identified as mutagenic or carcinogenic; {{there is a}} possible risk of congenital malformation in the fetus; may be harmful <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> and is extremely destructive to tissue of mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract; harmful if swallowed; harmful to and destructive of tissue and causes burns if absorbed through the skin or is {{in contact with the}} eyes. Symptoms and effects include a burning sensation, cough, wheezing, laryngitis, shortness of breath, spasm, inflammation and edema of the larynx, inflammation and edema of the bronchi, pneumonitis, pulmonary edema.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is absorbed}} through breathing {{and enters the}} blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. It is also produced in heme catabolism and enters the blood from the tissues, and thus is present in all normal tissues, even <b>if</b> not <b>inhaled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Uranyl acetate is {{very toxic}} <b>if</b> ingested, <b>inhaled</b> as dust or by skin contact if skin is cut or abraded. The {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} the combined effect of chemical toxicity and mild radioactivity and there is a danger of cumulative effects from long term exposure.|$|R

25|$|Ricin is {{very toxic}} <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> injected, or ingested. It {{can also be}} toxic if dust {{contacts}} the eyes {{or if it is}} absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. It prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger RNA in a process conducted by the cell's ribosome (the protein-making machinery)—that is, the most basic level of cell metabolism, essential to all living cells and thus to life itself. Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|E
25|$|Volcanoes {{can cause}} {{widespread}} destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. The effects include the volcanic eruption itself that may cause harm following {{the explosion of}} the volcano or falling rocks. Secondly, lava may be produced during the eruption of a volcano, and so as it leaves the volcano the lava destroys many buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. Thirdly, volcanic ash, generally meaning the cooled ash, may form a cloud, and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight but even small quantities will harm humans <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Since the ash has the consistency of ground glass it causes abrasion damage to moving parts such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is the pyroclastic flows, which consist of a cloud of hot volcanic ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that Pompeii was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. The 1953 Tangiwai disaster was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 Armero tragedy in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Fe(CO)5 is toxic, {{which is}} of concern because of its {{volatility}} (vapour pressure: [...] at 20°C). [...] <b>If</b> <b>inhaled,</b> iron pentacarbonyl may cause lung irritation, toxic pneumonitis, or pulmonary edema. [...] Like other metal carbonyls, Fe(CO)5 is flammable. It is, however, considerably less toxic than nickel tetracarbonyl.|$|E
50|$|Because acyl {{chlorides}} {{are such}} reactive compounds, precautions {{should be taken}} while handling them. They are lachrymatory because they can react with water at {{the surface of the}} eye producing hydrochloric and organic acids irritating to the eye. Similar problems can result <b>if</b> one <b>inhales</b> acyl chloride vapors.|$|R
50|$|Ammonium {{paramolybdate}} {{is harmful}} <b>if</b> swallowed or <b>inhaled.</b> It causes irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. It affects kidneys and blood.|$|R
50|$|Lead(IV) acetate may {{be fatal}} <b>if</b> ingested, <b>inhaled,</b> or absorbed through skin. It causes {{irritation}} to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. It is a neurotoxin. It affects the gum tissue, central nervous system, kidneys, blood, and reproductive system. Its oxidising nature can indirectly lead to many diseases, even cancer, by free radical mechanism.|$|R
2500|$|Sour gas, {{as it is}} known, in {{its natural}} state is laced with {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H2S), which can be lethal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in even tiny concentrations.

2500|$|Methane is flammable, {{explosive}} {{and dangerous}} to inhale, {{because it is}} a colorless, odorless gas, special caution must be taken around methane. [...] Ethane is also extremely flammable, dangerous to inhale and explosive. Both of these may cause suffocation. Similarly, propane is flammable and explosive. [...] It may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Butane has the same hazards to consider as propane.|$|E
2500|$|A 1983 April Fools' Day {{edition of}} the Durand Express, a weekly {{newspaper}} in Durand, Michigan, reported that [...] "dihydrogen oxide" [...] {{had been found in}} the city's water pipes, and warned that it was fatal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> and could produce blistering vapors. The first appearance of the hoax on the internet was attributed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to the so-called [...] "Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide", a parody organization at UC Santa Cruz following on-campus postings and newsgroup discussions in 1990.|$|E
50|$|It {{was very}} much by chance that Simpson survived the {{chloroform}} dosage he administered to himself. <b>If</b> he had <b>inhaled</b> too much and died, chloroform would {{have been seen as}} a dangerous substance, which in fact it is. Conversely, <b>if</b> Simpson had <b>inhaled</b> slightly less it would not have put him to sleep. It was his willingness to explore the possibilities of the substance that set him on the road to a career as a pioneer in the field of medicine.|$|R
