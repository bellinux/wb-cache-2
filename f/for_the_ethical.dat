40|$|Swiss {{hospitals}} {{were required to}} implement a prospective payment system for reimbursement using a diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) classification system {{by the beginning of}} 2012. Reforms to a health care system should be assessed for their impact, including their impact on ethically relevant factors. Over a number of years and in a number of countries, questions have been raised in the literature about <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> implications of <b>the</b> implementation of DRGs. However, despite this, researchers have not attempted to identify <b>the</b> major <b>ethical</b> issues associated with DRGs systematically. To address this gap in the literature, we have developed a matrix <b>for</b> identifying <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> implications of <b>the</b> implementation of DRGs.

The matrix consists of the ethically relevant parameters of health care systems on which DRGs are likely to have an impact; <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> values underlying these parameters; and examples of specific research questions associated with DRGs to illustrate how the matrix can be applied. While the matrix has been developed in light of the Swiss health care reform, it {{could be used as a}} basis <b>for</b> identifying <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> implications of DRG-based systems worldwide and <b>for</b> highlighting <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> implications of other kinds of provider payment systems (PPS) ...|$|R
