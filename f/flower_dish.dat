As of November 7, 2012, a {{roadside}} station opened up in Wadaura in order to promote whale and other local cuisine such as namero and sanga (なめろう), and Boshu Lobster, and there are 21 restaurants in Wada that serve whale. Tomiura {{is famous for}} loquat fruits and also has a roadside station promoting the sales of products containing loquat. The area of Iwai in Tomiura is famous for abalone. Being surrounded by water on three sides, the entirety of Minamibōsō is famous for the aforementioned seafood as well as sushi and sashimi.

50|$|Under Süleyman the Magnificent (1520-66), {{demand for}} Iznik wares increased. Jugs, hanging lamps, cups, bowls and dishes were produced, {{inspired}} by metalwork and illuminated books {{as well as}} Chinese ceramics. Many large dishes were made with looser designs, incorporating ships, animals, trees and <b>flowers.</b> The <b>dishes</b> {{appear to have been}} made for display, as most have pierced footrings {{so that they can be}} hung up, but they have been observed also to be scratched from use. Designs in the 1520s include the saz style in which a long, serrated saz leaf, dynamically arranged, is balanced by static rosette forms. In the later 16th century, the quatre fleurs style used a repertoire of stylised tulips, carnations, roses and hyacinths.|$|R

Nor were those lines of humor engraven about his mouth for nothing, {{to judge by the}} frequent peals of laughter from mademoiselle. Towards the close of dinner, Henri himself carried to them a superb violet ice, with real <b>flowers</b> around the <b>dish</b> and an electric light burning in the middle.|$|R
40|$|International audienceStrong {{seasonality}} in abiotic harshness and pollinator availability {{shape the}} reproductive success of plants. Plant species can avoid or can tolerate harsh abiotic conditions and can attract different pollinators, {{but it remains}} unknown (i) which of these capacities is most important for flowering phenology, (ii) whether tolerance/avoidance of abiotic harshness reinforces or relaxes the phenological differentiation of species attracting different pollinators. We assembled possibly the first functional trait database for a North African steppe covering 104 species. We inferred avoidance of harshness (drought) from dormancy, i. e. annual life-span and seed size. We inferred tolerance or resistance to harshness from small specific leaf area, small stature, deep roots and high dry matter content. We inferred the type of pollinators attracted from floral colour, shape and depth. We found that avoidance traits did not affect flowering phenology, and among tolerance traits only deep roots had an effect by delaying flowering. Flower colour (red or purple), and occasionally flower depth, delayed <b>flowering.</b> <b>Dish,</b> gullet and flag shape accelerated flowering. Interactive effects however were at least as important, inversing the mentioned relationship between floral characters and flowering phenology. Specifically, among drought-tolerant deep-rooted species, flowering phenologies converged among floral types attracting different pollinators, without becoming less variable overall. Direct and interactive effects of root depth and floral traits explained at least 45 % {{of the variance in}} flowering phenology. Also, conclusions on interactive effects were highly consistent with and without including information on family identity or outliers. Overall, roots and floral syndromes strongly control flowering phenology, while many other traits do not. Surprisingly, floral syndromes and the related pollinators appear to constrain phenology mainly in shallow-rooted, abiotically little tolerant species. Lack of abiotic tolerance might hence constrain accessible resources and thereby impose a stronger synchronization with biotic partners such as pollinators...|$|R

In 2013, Weehawken {{resident}} and comedian Susie Felber commissioned a modern remake of the painting {{in order to raise}} money for the Weehawken PTPO (a parent-teacher participating association). The remake, which was created by Brooklyn-based painter Stephen Gardner, depicts the scene as it appears now, with <b>flowers</b> and satellite <b>dishes,</b> and in lighter tones. Gardner's derivative painting was purchased on eBay for $510 by computer programmer Ligia Builes, who owns the house depicted in the painting.|$|R
50|$|The ripe {{fruit of}} the papaya is usually eaten raw, without skin or seeds. The unripe green fruit can be eaten cooked, usually in curries, salads, and stews. Green papaya is used in Southeast Asian cooking, both raw and cooked. In Thai cuisine, papaya is used to make Thai salads such as som tam and Thai curries such as kaeng som when still not fully ripe. In Indonesian cuisine, the unripe green fruits and young leaves are boiled for use as part of lalab salad, while the flower buds are sautéed and stir-fried with {{chillies}} and green tomatoes as Minahasan papaya <b>flower</b> vegetable <b>dish.</b> Papayas have a relatively high amount of pectin, {{which can be used}} to make jellies. The smell of ripe, fresh papaya flesh can strike some people as unpleasant. In Brazil, the unripe fruits are often used to make sweets or preserves.|$|R
50|$|In English culture {{the term}} does {{not refer to}} a single recipe, but {{describes}} the grand presentation of a large plated salad comprising many disparate ingredients. These can be arranged in layers or geometrical designs on a plate or mixed. The ingredients are then drizzled with a dressing. The dish aims to produce wide range of flavours and colours and textures on a single plate. Often recipes allow the cook to add various ingredients which may be available at hand, producing many variations of the <b>dish.</b> <b>Flowers</b> from broom and sweet violet were often used.|$|R

[...] Patterson describes its concept as combining haute cuisine, an emphasis on local vegetables, a modern aesthetic, and a personal approach to cooking, with [...] "a casual, neighborhood feeling". The approach was uncommon at the time, but later became a hallmark of Northern California restaurants. [...] His cooking at Coi involves foraging for wild ingredients, using aromas and essential oils (including asking patrons to rub grapefruit oil on their hands before a dish, or placing inedible fragrant <b>flowers</b> on a <b>dish),</b> and making his own ingredients (for example, butter churned in-house).|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1949 Mao Zedong {{declared}} {{the advent of}} the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The United States then suspended diplomatic ties, for decades. In 1950, the United States recalled its ambassador and urged United States citizens to leave China. On 25 June 1950 the struggle between North and South Korea became an international conflict with the adoption of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 and the entry of the United States into the Korean War. On 2 December 1950, Sone requested an exit visa from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The Chinese government required departing foreigners to advertise in the paper for three days in the event there was an outstanding issue someone wished to bring. While others were granted visas, the Sone’s visa was delayed and he was informed that his request was sent to Beijing for consideration. Finally in April, 1951 the Sones were allowed to leave after much of their personal effects were confiscated, such as Helen’s One Thousand <b>Flowers</b> pattern <b>dishes,</b> all United States currency, his field glasses and radio with a comment that it could be used to send signals. On 12 April the Sones arrived in Hong Kong, the last American missionaries to leave Nanjing. On their fourth furlough, they departed Hong Kong on 8 May 1951 for San Francisco on board the SS “President Wilson”, never to return to China.|$|R

It is a street scene rendered in dark, earthy tones depicting the gabled house at 1001 Boulevard East at the corner of 49th Street in Weehawken, New Jersey, and is considered one of Hopper's best works. It was acquired directly from the dealer handling the artist's paintings in 1952, fifteen years before the death of the painter, at a very low price. The painting sold for a record-breaking $36 million at Christie's in New York, to an anonymous telephone bidder. That same year, Weehawken resident and comedian Susie Felber commissioned a modern remake of the painting in order {{to raise money for the}} Weehawken PTPO.

5000|$|How much each {{of these}} {{influences}} affects local cooking varies. Zongolica is considered {{to have the most}} pure indigenous cuisine. Tlacotalpan is considered to have the most Spanish style cuisine. [...] One division of Veracruz is the cooking of the coast versus that of the mountains. The cooking of the coast shows the most foreign influence and the most fish, with dishes such as arroz a la tumbada, similar to paella. The cooking of the mountains contains a wide variety of mushrooms, greens, various <b>flowers</b> and corn <b>dishes.</b> Typical dishes of the mountain city of Xalapa include stuffed jalapeño chili peppers, stuffed chipotle peppers, a stew made with the izote flower (from the yucca plant) as well as an adobo, red rice, pambazos, caldo blanco, tortas de gasparitos, chileatole, cooked poblano chili pepper strips and turnovers filled with squash flowers. [...] The state is also divided into seven regions, based on natural geography, ethnic composition and interactions with other parts of Mexico. The Totonacs of the north of the state have had their food influenced by the French who immigrated to the area in the 19th century. Cooking in the south of the state shows influence from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the Zapotecs migrated as far as here and traded goods with the Nahua peoples of the Gulf coast.|$|R
