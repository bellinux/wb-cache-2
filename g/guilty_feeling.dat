40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} assess the effectiveness of cognitive behavior group therapy on thought- action fusion, thought suppression and guilt feelings of university students. In this experimental pretest- posttest study, 518 female university students responded to 3 instrument: TAF Scale, Thought Suppression Scale and <b>Guilty</b> <b>Feelings</b> Scale. Then 30 subjects who had high scores in the three scales {{were randomly assigned to}} two equalsize experimental and control groups. The experimental group received 8 sessions of cognitive behavior therapy based on Zucker and et al model.

40|$|Guilt proneness is a {{personality}} trait {{indicative of a}} predisposition to experience negative feelings about personal wrongdoing, even when the wrongdoing is private. It {{is characterized by the}} anticipation of feeling bad about committing transgressions rather than by <b>guilty</b> <b>feelings</b> in a particular moment or generalized <b>guilty</b> <b>feelings</b> that occur without an eliciting event. Our research has revealed that guilt proneness is an important character trait because knowing a personâ€™s level of guilt proneness helps us to predict the likelihood that person will behave unethically. Web-based studies of adults across the United States have shown that people who score high on measures of guilt proneness (compared to low scorers) make fewer unethical business decisions, commit fewer delinquent behaviors, and behave more honestly when making economic decisions. In the workplace, guilt-prone employees are less likely to engage in counterproductive behaviors that harm their organization...|$|R

She began to understand that half the pleasure she had taken in her hours with Moss and Humiston lay in the freedom from her husband's over-shadowing presence. He was not a man to be ignored, as she had seen wives ignore and put aside their meek partners. Marshall Haney even yet was a dominating personality, even though his family affairs were so insistent and so difficult to manage or explain.

As she thought thus, the half-blown rose went to join the bud; and then, after a pause, she slowly kissed the perfect rose, and added it to the tell-tale group, saying to herself with a sort of sweet solemnity, as if the words were a vow: ...|$|E
6000|$|Very {{sweet and}} tender and {{beautiful}} Stephen {{looked at this}} moment.

The proudness of her bearing was no less marked than ever, but in the willowy sway of her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride. In all the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none so dear or so alluring, consciously as well as instinctively, to true men as this self-surrender. As Leonard drew near, Stephen sank softly into a seat, doing so with a <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling</b> of acting a part. When he actually came into the grove he found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed out over the wide expanse in front of her. He was hot after his walk, and with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane armchair, exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old familiarity: ...|$|E

60|$|Like most shy girls, Mara {{became more}} shy the more really she {{understood}} the nature of her own feelings. The conversation with Sally had opened {{her eyes to the}} secret of her own heart, and she had a <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling</b> as if what she had discovered must be discovered by every one else. Yes, it was clear she loved Moses {{in a way that made}} him, she thought, more necessary to her happiness than she could ever be to his,--in a way that made it impossible to think of him as wholly and for life devoted to another, without a constant inner conflict. In vain had been all her little stratagems practiced upon herself the whole summer long, to prove to herself that she was glad that the choice had fallen upon Sally. She saw clearly enough now that she was not glad,--that there was no woman or girl living, however dear, who could come for life between him and her, without casting on her heart the shuddering sorrow of a dim eclipse.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her shyly. He {{was not a man}} to do homage to {{material}} gods, but the pomp and circumstance with which she was surrounded had had a sobering effect upon him, and added to his sense of the instability and unreality of the present moment. He had an almost <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling</b> of having broken an unwritten law, of abducting a princess, and the old Duncan house had seemed to frown protestingly that such an act should have taken place under its windows. If Victoria had been--to him--an ordinary mortal in expensive furs instead of a princess, he would have snapped his fingers at the pomp and circumstance. These typified the comforts which, in a wild and forgetful moment, he might ask her to leave. Not that he believed she would leave them. He had lived long enough to know that an interest by a woman in a man--especially a man beyond the beaten track of her observation--did not necessarily mean that she might marry him if he asked her. And yet--oh, Tantalus! here she was beside him, for one afternoon again his very own, their two souls ringing with the harmony of whirling worlds in sunlit space. He sought refuge in thin thought; he strove, in oblivion, to drain the cup of the hour of its nectar, even as he had done before. Generations of Puritan Vanes (whose descendant alone had harassed poor Sarah Austere) were in his blood; and there they hung in the long gallery of Time, mutely but sternly forbidding when he raised his hand to the stem.|$|E
60|$|In that {{suppressed}} and evasive life {{beneath the}} outer forms and procedures {{of school and}} home, there came glimmerings of something that seemed charged {{with the promise of}} holding everything together, the key, religion. She was attracted to religion, much more attracted than she would confess even to herself, but every circumstance in her training dissuaded her from a free approach. Her mother treated religion with a reverence that was almost indistinguishable from huffiness. She never named the deity and she did not like the mention of His name: she threw a spell of indelicacy over religious topics that Ellen never thoroughly cast off. She put God among objectionable topics--albeit a sublime one. Miss Beeton Clavier sustained this remarkable suggestion. When she read prayers in school she did so with the balanced impartiality of one who offers no comment. She seemed pained as she read and finished with a sigh. Whatever she intended to convey, she conveyed that even if the divinity was not all He should be, if, indeed, He was a person almost primitive, having neither the restraint nor the self-obliteration of a refined gentlewoman, no word of it should ever pass her lips. And so Ellen as a girl never let her mind go quite easily into this reconciling core of life, and talked of it only very rarely and shyly with a few chosen coevals. It wasn't very profitable talk. They had a <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling,</b> they laughed a little uneasily, they displayed a fatal proclivity to stab the swelling gravity of their souls with some forced and silly jest and so tumble back to ground again before they rose too high....|$|E
5000|$|Lewis Carroll: A Biography is a 1995 {{biography}} of author Lewis Carroll by Morton N. Cohen, first published by Knopf, later by Macmillan. It {{is generally considered}} to be the definitive scholarly work on Carroll's (real name Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) life. Cohen's approach is mainly chronological, with some chapters grouped by theme, such as those on Carroll's religion, his love of little girls, and his <b>guilty</b> <b>feelings.</b> Cohen, a Carroll scholar for 30 years, opts to use Dodgson's first name, Charles, throughout the work, because it [...] "seems most appropriate in a book dealing with the intimacy of his life".|$|R

She lived with feelings of guilt, which had no negative impact on her daily life; and she practised good behaviour in order to achieve good karma.

6000|$|She {{said nothing}} of the summons which she had {{received}} that morning, or of her answer; and her account of {{the matter of the}} dismissal and reinstatement was brief and dignified, and contained no mention of Mr. Worthington's name or agency. It was her duty, too, to rebuke Bob for the quarrel with his father, to point out the folly of it, and the wrong, and to urge him as strongly as she could to retract, though she felt that all this was useless. And then--then came the betrayal of hope. She could not ask him never to see her again, but she did beseech him for her sake, {{and for the sake of}} that love which he had declared, not to attempt to see her: not for a year, she wrote, though the word looked to her like eternity. Her reasons, aside from her own scruples, were so obvious, while she taught in Brampton, that she felt that he would consent to banishment--until the summer holidays in July, at least: and then she would be in Coniston,--and would have had time to decide upon future steps. A reprieve was all she craved,--a reprieve in which to reflect, for she was in no condition to reflect now. Of one thing she was sure, that it would not be right at this time to encourage him although she had a <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling</b> that the letter had given him encouragement in spite of all the prohibitions it contained.

60|$|Nurses and attendants upon {{children}} from certain nationalities in Europe are peculiarly disposed to employ {{this method of}} governing children placed under their care. One reason {{is that they are}} accustomed to this mode of management at home; and another is that many of them are brought up under an idea, which prevails extensively in some of those countries, that it is right to tell falsehoods where the honest object is to accomplish a charitable or useful end. Accordingly, inasmuch as the restraining of the {{children from}} wrong is a good and useful object, they can declare the existence of giants and hobgoblins, to carry away and devour bad girls and boys, with an air of positiveness and seeming honesty, and with a calm and persistent assurance, which aids them very much in producing on the minds of the children a conviction of the truth of what they say; while, on the other hand, those who, in theory at least, occupy the position that the direct falsifying of one's word is never justifiable, act at a disadvantage in attempting this method. For although, in practice, they are often inclined to make an exception to their principles in regard to truth in the case of what is said to young children, they can not, after all, tell children what they know to be not true with that bold and confident air necessary to carry full conviction to the children's minds. They are embarrassed by a kind of half <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling,</b> which, partially at least, betrays them, and the children do not really and fully believe what they say. They can not suppose that their mother would really tell them what she knew was false, and yet they can not help perceiving that she does not speak and look as if what she was saying was actually true.|$|E
60|$|Reuben, {{having made}} the desired {{alteration}} in his companion's posture, again began his solitary pilgrimage. He walked more hastily at first than {{was consistent with}} his strength; for a sort of <b>guilty</b> <b>feeling,</b> which sometimes torments men in their most justifiable acts, caused him to seek concealment from Malvin's eyes; but after he had trodden far upon the rustling forest leaves he crept back, impelled by a wild and painful curiosity, and, sheltered by the earthy roots of an uptorn tree, gazed earnestly at the desolate man. The morning sun was unclouded, and the trees and shrubs imbibed the sweet air of the month of May; yet there seemed a gloom on Nature's face, as if she sympathized with mortal pain and sorrow Roger Malvin's hands were uplifted in a fervent prayer, {{some of the words}} of which stole through the stillness of the woods and entered Reuben's heart, torturing it with an unutterable pang. They were the broken accents of a petition for his own happiness and that of Dorcas; and, as the youth listened, conscience, or something in its similitude, pleaded strongly with him to return and lie down again by the rock. He felt how hard was the doom of the kind and generous being whom he had deserted in his extremity. Death would come like the slow approach of a corpse, stealing gradually towards him through the forest, and showing its ghastly and motionless features from behind a nearer and yet a nearer tree. But such must have been Reuben's own fate had he tarried another sunset; and who shall impute blame to him if he shrink from so useless a sacrifice? As he gave a parting look, a breeze waved the little banner upon the sapling oak and reminded Reuben of his vow.|$|E

In 1905, Paasche became commander in chief in the Rufiji-region, now southern Tanzania. His command was decisive, but he also took pains to reach a swift pacification. Refugees and defeated Africans found medical help and shelter at his headquarters at Mtanza. He was decorated with the Order of the Crown with Swords, but was removed from command because of his independent peace negotiations.

While the fate of a single rescued dolphin may capture public attention through the media, there is no consistent discussion about millions of species â€˜harvestedâ€™ for consumption, or used for medical experiments. Despite <b>guilty</b> <b>feelings</b> of a few individuals, cultural prioritizing of transportation and energy policies place â€˜mobilityâ€™ and â€˜modernityâ€™ before animal welfare (Desmond 2013).|$|R
