5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of <b>denial</b> using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change <b>denial</b> itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in <b>denial</b> within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The large percentage of Americans that rely on private health insurance for health care coverage could expand with enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010. Until PPACA is fully implemented, some consumers seeking coverage can have their applications for enrollment denied, and those enrolled may face <b>denials</b> of coverage for specific medical services. PPACA required GAO to study the rates of such application and coverage <b>denials.</b> GAO reviewed the data available on <b>denials</b> of (1) applications for enrollment and (2) coverage for medical services. GAO reviewed newly available nationwide data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 459 insurers operating in the individual market on application <b>denials</b> from January through March 2010. GAO also reviewed {{a year or more}} of the available data from six states on the rates of application and coverage <b>denials</b> and the rates and outcomes of appeals related to coverage <b>denials.</b> The six states included all states identified by experts and in the literature as collecting data on the rates of application or coverage <b>denials</b> and together represented over 20 percent of private health insurance enrollment nationally. GAO conducted a literature review to identify studies related to application and coverage <b>denials</b> and reviewed data from selected studies. GAO interviewed HHS and state officials and researchers about factors to consider when interpreting the data. ...|$|R

40|$|How do online shops re-build trust on consumer-generated review sites after {{customers}} accuse them of misbehaving? Theories {{suggest that}} the effectiveness of responses depends {{on the type of}} accusation, yet online research indicates that apologies are superior to <b>denials</b> regardless of the type of accusation. We argue that customers are suspicious about online sellers, making <b>denials</b> implausible and ineffective in re-building trust. A good reputation may mitigate suspicion, making <b>denials</b> more believable and restoring trust. An experiment employed mock-ups of consumer review sites featuring different forms of consumers’ complaints and shops’ responses. Although reputable online shops were regarded as more trustworthy, results confirmed that <b>denials</b> tended not to be believed and did not re-build trust. Apologies generated superior effects...|$|R

5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} <b>denial,</b> going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change <b>denial</b> in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change <b>denial</b> to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in <b>denial,</b> the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E

5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change <b>denial.</b> In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of <b>denial</b> due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

Lastly, he looks at some future scenarios and explains what people should do.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible <b>denial</b> that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his <b>denial</b> despite the threat.|$|E

In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus.

40|$|According to an in " uential contextualist {{solution}} to skepticism advanced by Keith DeRose, <b>denials</b> of skeptical hypotheses are, in most contexts, strong yet insensitive. # e strength of such <b>denials</b> allows for knowledge of them, thus undermining skepticism, while the insensitivity of such <b>denials</b> explains our intuition {{that we do}} not know them. In this paper we argue that, under some well-motivated conditions, a negated skeptical hypothesis is strong only if it is sensitive. We also consider how a natural response on behalf of DeRose appears to be equally available to his primary rival (viz., the sensitivity theorist) ...|$|R
