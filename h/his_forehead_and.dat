5|$|Alexios and his guards {{resisted}} {{as long as}} {{they could}} before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to Ohrid, where he regrouped his army.|$|E
5|$|Aravan {{is always}} worshipped in temples {{in the form}} of his severed head. He is usually {{depicted}} with a moustache, pronounced eyes and large ears. Typically, he also wears a conical crown, a Vaishnava tilak mark on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> earrings. Aravan is often depicted with a cobra hood over his crown, cobra heads sprouting through the crown, or a snake emerging from behind the crown. Even the chief Koovagam icon features a serpent on Aravan's crown.|$|E

5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> moved his leg after the {{cameraman}} had said he was dead, {{and that there was}} no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{made his}} {{professional}} debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in Miami, Florida and defeated Michael Johnson by technical knockout {{in the second}} round. On April 14, 1998, Judah defeated Angel Beltre in the second round. Judah accidentally butted heads with Esteban Flores in a fight in March 1999. Flores was cut on <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> the match was halted in the third round. The bout was originally recorded as a technical draw, but the result was changed to a no contest in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E

5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1620 (1564 CE) as per some sources, Rama again {{appeared}} to Tulsidas, {{this time as}} a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came {{and asked for a}} sandalwood Tilaka (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E
25|$|Like all Qing officials, Chen had {{to shave}} <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> arrange his {{hair into a}} queue like the Manchus, and to adopt the Qing court dress, which {{featured}} smaller sleeves and a shorter sash than the Ming court style, as befitted {{the status of the}} Manchus as horseback-riding warriors.|$|E

25|$|In the {{old school}} they use now for the Village Hall, below the clock that has stood always at one minute past ten, hangs a small dusty {{painting}} of a horse. He stands, a splendid red bay with a remarkable white cross emblazoned on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> with four perfectly matched white socks. He looks wistfully out of the picture, his ears pricked forward, his head turned {{as if he has}} just noticed us standing there.|$|E
25|$|Hoover tells Gandy {{to destroy}} his secret files {{after his death}} in order to prevent President Richard Nixon from {{possessing}} them. He visits Tolson, who urges him to retire. Hoover refuses, claiming that Nixon is going to destroy the bureau he has created. Tolson accuses Hoover of having exaggerated his involvement with key events of the Bureau. Moments later, Hoover tells Tolson that he needed him, more than he ever needed anyone else. He holds his hand, kisses <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> leaves.|$|E
25|$|The Second Test in Cape Town {{followed}} immediately. Australia made 542, and in South Africa's reply of 353 Lindsay {{made only}} 5; {{he was caught}} (and had to be carried from the field) when the ball ricocheted from his bat to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> back to the bowler, David Renneberg. Following on, South Africa lost four wickets for 60 before Lindsay, with his head bandaged, made 81 off 134 balls, adding 119 with Lance to help the team reach 367. Australia then made 160 for 4 to win by six wickets and level the series. Lindsay took three catches in the match and conceded only two byes.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 2005, Norwegian Major General Bjørn Egge gave an {{interview}} to the newspaper Aftenposten on the events surrounding Hammarskjöld's death. According to General Egge, {{who had been the}} first UN officer to see the body, Hammarskjöld had a hole in <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> this hole was subsequently airbrushed from photos taken of the body. It appeared to Egge that Hammarskjöld had been thrown from the plane, and grass and leaves in his hands might indicate that he survived the crash – and that he had tried to scramble away from the wreckage. Egge does not claim directly that the wound was a gunshot wound.|$|E
25|$|Mary is {{described}} by scholars as an Eleusa icon because of the tender {{manner in which the}} child is nestled against her cheek, setting the image as an intimate portrayal of the bond between mother and child. Her head is tilted towards her son and embraces <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> cheek almost as if in a kiss, while her arms warmly cradle him. He has one leg bent and another extended towards her, while his right arm is held upright and intimately holds her chin from below. This closeness and engagement of mother and child is a departure from Byzantine tradition, where they were often shown almost at arms length, and was in tune with the ideals of the Italian Quattrocento.|$|E
25|$|According {{to medical}} staff who {{examined}} {{his body in}} Cork and in Dublin, there were two wounds to Collins' head: an entry wound at the hairline on the front left of <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> a large exit wound {{at the rear of}} his skull, just behind his right ear. There was no complete post mortem as it was evident from his head wounds as to the medical cause of his death. His field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton who had been with Collins throughout his tour of the south. Collins' body was taken first to Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment. It was then taken by ship around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin (at the hospital's first site). From there it was taken to City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it lay in state.|$|E

500|$|Hatanaka, on a motorcycle, and Shiizaki, on horseback, rode {{through the}} streets, tossing {{leaflets}} that explained their motives and their actions. Within {{an hour before}} the Emperor's broadcast, sometime around 11:00, August 15, Hatanaka placed his pistol to <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> shot himself. Shiizaki stabbed himself with a dagger, and then shot himself. In Hatanaka's pocket was found his death poem: [...] "I have nothing to regret now that the dark clouds have disappeared from the reign of the Emperor." ...|$|E
500|$|The khan wore a green satin robe; his hair, {{which was}} ten feet long, was free. A band of white silk wound round <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> hung down behind.
