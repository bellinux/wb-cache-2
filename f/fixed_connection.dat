25|$|Another {{determining}} {{design feature}} was the relationship linking naos and peristasis. In the original temples, {{this would have}} been subject entirely to practical necessities, and always based on axial links between cella walls and columns, but the introduction of stone architecture broke that connection. Nevertheless, it did survive throughout Ionic architecture. In Doric temples, however, the wooden roof construction, originally placed behind the frieze, now started at a higher level, behind the geison. This ended the structural link between frieze and roof; the structural elements of the latter could now be placed independent of axial relationships. As a result, the cella walls lost their <b>fixed</b> <b>connection</b> with the columns {{for a long time and}} could be freely placed within the peristasis. Only after a long phase of developments did the architects choose the alignment of the outer wall face with the adjacent column axis as the obligatory principle for Doric temples. Doric temples in Greater Greece rarely follow this system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{application}} of genetic programming for construction of state machines controlling systems with complex behavior. Application of this method is illustrated on example of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control. It helps to find control strategies of collaborative behavior of UAV teams. Multi-agent approach is used, where every agent that controls a UAV is presented by a deterministic finite state machine. Two representations of finite state machines are used: abridged transition tables and decision trees. Novel algorithms for <b>fixing</b> <b>connections</b> between states and for removing unachievable branches of trees are proposed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Competition in {{the airline}} {{industry}} depends greatly on how efficiently crews are scheduled. Scheduling problems can be modeled as integer programs which can be solved exactly using branch-and-price methods. However, in practice, in order to find a good schedule expediently, the branch-and-price tree is often only partially explored. A constraint branching heuristic called <b>connection</b> <b>fixing</b> often selects branches containing optimal or near-optimal solutions. This thesis investigates utilizing <b>connection</b> <b>fixing</b> in a branchand-price algorithm to exactly solve airline crew scheduling problems. We present a mathematical model for optimizing airline crew scheduling that is suitable for the branch-and-price algorithm. Then we present the branch-and-price method for solving integer programs, the <b>connection</b> <b>fixing</b> heuristic, and how this can be integrated into a branch-and-price method. Finally, we evaluate these ideas by implementing a branch-and-price system using <b>connection</b> <b>fixing</b> and use this system to solve exactly several small and medium sized crew scheduling problems. The numerical results suggest that the branch-and-price method with <b>connection</b> <b>fixing</b> is a promising method for exactly solving large-scale crew scheduling problems...|$|R

50|$|To keep {{development}} costs down, as many components as possible were adopted from the single-engine PC-6 Porter, {{such as the}} center fuselage, the wings and main landing gear. There was a new development of the forward fuselage, also with the tail and {{the arrangement of the}} propellers. The cabin was easily converted for various tasks. First drafts showed a motor assembly right and left of the fuselage nose, similar to the Dornier Do 28. A tandem arrangement of the engines like on the Dornier Wal above the fuselage, as with the earlier flying boats, was considered. In the final design, the engines were located very close, in front of the wings, to the fuselage with separate engine pylons. There was no <b>fixed</b> <b>connection</b> between the engines and the wings, but a gap as in a slat. With this arrangement, it was hoped to obtain favorable values for single-engined flight.|$|E
