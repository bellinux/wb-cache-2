5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre.

Valperga attempted to correct these flaws by making a number of alterations to San Salvatore Bastion on the western end of the lines, and constructing a faussebraye around the entire land front and a crowned hornwork near the eastern <b>end.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1680s some minor modifications were made by the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh.|$|E
