5000|$|Simple {{surgical}} masks protect wearers {{from being}} splashed {{in the mouth}} with body fluids, and prevent transmission of body fluids from the wearer to others, e.g. the patient. They also remind wearers not to touch their mouth or nose, which could otherwise transfer viruses and bacteria after having touched a contaminated surface (<b>fomite).</b> They can also reduce the spread of infectious liquid droplets (carrying bacteria or viruses) that are created when the wearer coughs or sneezes. There is no clear evidence that disposable face masks worn {{by members of the}} surgical team would reduce the risk of wound infections after clean surgical procedures. Cotton and gauze masks do not serve as surgical masks as they do not offer adequate filtration of microbes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to hand washing, gloves {{play an important}} role in reducing the risks of transmission of microorganisms. Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of bloodborne pathogen infections. Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a <b>fomite</b> can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral proteins to host glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) mediates endocytosis of the virus into the host cell. Fusion with the plasma membrane to release the core into the host cytoplasm. Early phase: early genes are transcribed in the cytoplasm by viral RNA polymerase. Early expression begins at 30 minutes post-infection. Core is completely uncoated as early expression ends, viral genome is now free in the cytoplasm. Intermediate phase: Intermediate genes are expressed, triggering genomic DNA replication at approximately 100 minutes post-infection. Late phase: Late genes are expressed from 140 min to 48 hours post-infection, producing all structural proteins. Assembly of progeny virions starts in cytoplasmic viral factories, producing an spherical immature particle. This virus particle matures into brick-shaped intracellular mature virion (IMV). IMV virion can be released upon cell lysis, or can acquire a second double membrane from trans-Golgi and bud as external enveloped virion (EEV)host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. Dna templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by existing in occlusion bodies after cell death and remaining infectious until finding another host.Lagomorph and squirrels serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are <b>fomite,</b> mechanical, and contact.|$|E

40|$|Fomites {{involved}} in influenza transmission are either hand- or droplet-contaminated. We evaluated {{the interactions of}} <b>fomite</b> characteristics and human behaviors affecting these routes using an Environmental Infection Transmission System (EITS) model by comparing the basic reproduction numbers (R 0) for different <b>fomite</b> mediated transmission pathways. Fomites classified as large versus small surface sizes (reflecting high versus low droplet contamination levels) and high versus low touching frequency have important differences. For example, 1) the highly touched large surface <b>fomite</b> (public tables) has the highest transmission potential and generally strongest control measure effects; 2) transmission from droplet-contaminated routes exceed those from hand-contaminated routes except for highly touched small surface fomites such as door knob handles; and 3) covering a cough using the upper arm or using tissues effectively removes virus from the system and thus decreases total <b>fomite</b> transmission. Because covering a cough by hands diverts pathogens from the droplet-fomite route to the hand-fomite route, this {{has the potential to}} increase total <b>fomite</b> transmission for highly touched small surface fomites. An improved understanding and more refined data related to <b>fomite</b> mediated transmission routes will help inform intervention strategies for influenza and other pathogens that are mediated through the environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{estimating}} pathogen exposure via <b>fomite</b> transmission and for predicting the infection risk was proposed.

In a hypothetical case of influenza transmission in an aircraft cabin mock-up, spatial distribution of infection risks according to the aerosol deposition characteristics was revealed using the proposed model. The passengers next to and immediately in front of the source had infection risks via the <b>fomite</b> transmission route 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than other passengers. The proposed model can be a tool for investigating the effects of different parameters on infection risks by <b>fomite</b> transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemic}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) {{had a significant}} effect on global society in the early 2000 s and the potential of its resurgence exists. Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of <b>fomite</b> transmission in the well-known Ward 8 A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i. e., the long-range airborne, <b>fomite</b> and combined routes, in 1, 744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and <b>fomite</b> routes, and that the <b>fomite</b> route played a non-negligible role in the transmission...|$|E
40|$|Norovirus infection, {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} condition {{associated with a}} high rate of morbidity, comprises a significant health issue. Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via <b>fomite</b> transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether <b>fomite</b> transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative <b>fomite</b> transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the <b>fomite</b> route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future...|$|E
