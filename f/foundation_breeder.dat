Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some Dachshunds.

5000|$|Foxhounds {{were found}} to be {{inadequate}} for hunting American animals that did not hide near the ground, but instead climbed trees, such as raccoons, opossums, bobcats, and even larger prey like cougars and bears. The dogs were often confused or unable to hold the scent when this occurred, and would mill about. This {{led to the development of}} treeing hounds by hunters and dog <b>breeders.</b> <b>Foundation</b> dogs were chosen for a keen sense of smell, the ability to track an animal independent of human commands, and, most importantly, to follow an animal both on the ground and when it took to a tree. Bloodhounds specifically were added to many coonhound lines to enhance the ability to track.|$|R
40|$|Potato tuber {{necrotic}} ringspot disease (PTNRD) is a tuber deformity {{associated with}} infection by the tuber necrotic strain of Potato virus Y (PVYNTN). PTNRD negatively impacts tuber quality and marketability, and poses {{a serious threat}} to seed and commercial potato production worldwide. PVYNTN symptoms differ in the cultivars Waneta and Pike: Waneta expresses severe PTNRD and foliar mosaic with vein and leaf necrosis, whereas Pike does not express PTNRD and mosaic is the only foliar symptom. To map loci that influence tuber and foliar symptoms, 236 F 1 progeny of a cross between Waneta and Pike were inoculated with PVYNTN isolate NY 090029 and genotyped using 12, 808 potato SNPs. Foliar symptom type and severity were monitored for 10 wk, while tubers were evaluated for PTNRD expression at harvest and again after 60 d in storage. Pairwise correlation analyses indicate a strong association between PTNRD and vein necrosis (τ = 0. 4195). QTL analyses revealed major-effect QTL on chromosomes 4 and 5 for mosaic, 4 for PTNRD, and 5 for foliar necrosis symptoms. Locating QTL associated with PVY-related symptoms provides a <b>foundation</b> for <b>breeders</b> to develop markers {{that can be used to}} eliminate potato clones with undesirable phenotypes, e. g., those likely to develop PTNRD or to be symptomless carriers of PVY...|$|R
50|$|The Serengeti is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. Recognized and registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), no other first generation crosses can be registered as Serengeti. From the Bengal × Oriental cross came the first <b>foundation</b> Serengeti. <b>Breeders</b> then {{worked with the}} cat to produce a cat that resembles the breed profile set by TICA.Created by Karen Sausman of Kingsmark Cattery in California in 1994, the breed {{is still in the}} development stages, but the ultimate aim is to produce a cat that looks similar to a serval, without using any recent wild cat blood. (Bengal cats originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic cats. Most Bengal cats used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forebears except alleles affecting coat color.)Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears. They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering. Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 and 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs. Because the Bengal stock is a hybrid cat, the Serengeti is also classified as a hybrid.|$|R

At {{the time he}} was living with his first wife and their sons, Allan (d. May 31, 1999) and Lance. When Lance was 9 years old, in the early 1950s, the family moved to Orange, Connecticut, where they built a house near a veterinary clinic run by Hart's longtime friend Leon Whitney. Partly through this connection, Hart and his son Allan eventually became beagle breeders whose dogs included the bench champion Lynnlann's Button Up. Hart continued as a freelance writer, and combining his vocations by writing and editing nonfiction books for dog-owners.

40|$|Yam {{production}} is constrained by scarcity of clean seed, pests, diseases and low soil fertility in the informal seed system, {{which is still}} operational, causing up to 90 % yield losses. Although meristem culture can be effective for producing healthy seed yam, its use is limited by slow rate of regeneration and propagation in conventional tissue cultures. In most crops tested, temporary immersion bioreactor systems (TIBs) increased propagation rates. To determine the potential of TIBs in improving the yam seed system, 23 databases were consulted and three returned a total of eight publications with only 2 for Dioscorea rotundata-cayenensis. Both plantlets and microtubers can be produced in TIBs, which will facilitate production of quality <b>breeder,</b> <b>foundation</b> and certified seeds and fast-track genetic improvement {{and the evolution of}} a formal from informal seed production system. Control of contamination, direct use of field explants, culture of micro-explants like immature embryos and anthers, increasing the size of microtubers produced and standardization for various economically important yam genotypes are knowledge gaps that require immediate research attention. No report has put a cost on yam TIBs, but {{it will be necessary to}} use cost-effective TIBs to encourage integration public-private partnerships into emerging formal seed system. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{guide to}} the {{techniques}} required to produce pure and vigorous seed from varieties of this cross-pollinated crop. Multiplication rates, through sequential <b>breeder,</b> <b>foundation,</b> and certified seed stages, are high: 3 kg of seed are adequate for sowing 1 ha, subsequently producing 1 tonne of clean seed. Nucleus seed plots (stage 0), sown for regeneration once every 4 years, should be effectively is o- lated. They should be between 0, 1 and 0. 2 ha in size, and contain at least 3000 plants. Plots of breeder seed(stage 1) should similarly be well isolated, and rigorously inspected and rogued, and not more than 1 % of off - types should be permit tedatfinal inspection. Plot sizes are normally between 0. 1 and 0. 5 ha, according to how much certified seed is required, using a conservative multiplication factor of X 200. At the end of the foundation seed stage (stage 2), through protective perimeter planting, inspection, and rogueing, off-types should be less than 2 %. At the final certified seed stage(3), the permitted level of off-types is 5 %.

40|$|To {{sustain the}} seed {{production}} chain, the project adopted the popular model of ‘one variety one village’. ICRISAT provided the <b>Breeder,</b> <b>Foundation</b> and hybrid parent seeds. To {{benefit from the}} partnership with the Seed Certifying Agency, OSSOPCA, {{it was necessary to}} strengthen and institutionalize the informal seed production system in the districts of Kalahandi, Nauparha and Rayagada. This activity resulted in the production of 590 tons of different types of seeds (Foundation, Certified and Truthfully Labeled) of Asha, Maruti, ICP 7035, ICPL 88039, ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740. From this production, the project procured 44 tons of certified seeds of Asha and Maruti and 8 tons of Foundation seeds of farmer-preferred varieties (Asha, Maruti, ICP 7035, and ICPL 88039) to be distributed to smallholder farmers for the conduct of IPPT and seed production of Certified seeds in the 2013 - 2014 cropping season. ICRISAT will continuously provide the Breeder seeds (1, 440 kg) of farmer-preferred varieties and parental lines (540 kg) of ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 for multiplication of female parents (AxB) and hybrid seed (AxR).

In the field of seed processing, two officers, two mechanics and a technician were trained at Sapu in the operation and maintenance of equipment, and the nece ssary tools were supplied by the projectIt was not expected that good-quality seed will face marketing probl ems in the near future, if prices are reasonable; however, it is recommended that seed dem and be assessed each season, to prevent the development of oversupplyIt was recommended that someone with an engineering background be re cruited for operation and maintenance of the equipment at Sapu.
