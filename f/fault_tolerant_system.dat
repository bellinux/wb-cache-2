It is therefore necessary to build computer systems that offer essential services even in the presence of a successful attack. Such systems are called intrusion <b>tolerant.</b> Intrusion <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> differ from <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> by their threat models. <b>Fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to survive spontaneous errors (due to natural physical processes), whereas intrusion <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> should withstand attacks from skilled, well informed and resourceful adversaries who would launch multi-stage attacks on the system, where also the detection and recovery mechanisms are targeted.

The research is based on the use of FPGA partial dynamic reconfiguration for the design of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems.</b> In these applications, the partial dynamic reconfiguration {{can be used as a}} mechanism to correct the fault and recover the system after the fault occurrence. First, the general principles of diagnostics, testing and digital systems dependability are presented including a brief description of FPGA components and their architectures. Next, a survey of currently used methods and techniques used for the design and implementation of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> into FPGA is described, especially the methods used for fault detection and localization, their correction, together with the principles of evaluating <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> design quality.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the reinitialization of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> in which detection and isolation (FDI) techniques are used, on-line, to identify and compensate for system failures. Specifically, it will focus on FDI techniques which utilize analytic redundancy, arising from a knowledge of the plant dynamics, by analyzing the residuals of a no-fail filter designed on the assumption of no failures. In these types of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems,</b> system failures have to propagate through the no-fail filter dynamics in order to get detected. Therefore, the no-fail filter must be reinitialized after the isolation of a failure so that the accumulated effects of the failure are removed.

Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, {{the failure of the}} tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a related cost, and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).|$|E
