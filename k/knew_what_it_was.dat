25|$|Questions {{were raised}} {{on why the}} SS Uganda {{did not come to}} give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby could see and identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with an answering light. This suggests that they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> but did not came to help them.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Paterson of the Australian Film Critics Association {{gave the}} film 3 out of 5stars, writing that the {{generally}} poor reception {{for the film}} was [...] "a sad fate for a surprisingly sincere tribute to Robert Wise's 1951 classic."

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> including the governor." ...|$|E

Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular school subjects, Babel studied the Talmud and music. According to Cynthia Ozick, [...] "Though {{he was at}} home in Yiddish and Hebrew, and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with Maupassant and Flaubert. His first stories were composed in fluent literary French. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes. He befriended whores, cabdrivers, jockeys; he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like to be penniless, to live on the edge and off the beaten track." ...|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the word}} in a musical context was {{documented}} as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916 Times-Picayune article about [...] "jas bands." [...] In an interview with NPR, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the original slang connotations of the term, saying: [...] "When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z.' [...] It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S.' That was dirty, and if you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> you wouldn't say it in front of ladies."

2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Fred and George Weasley {{give the}} map to Harry {{so he can}} travel {{to the village of}} Hogsmeade through a hidden passageway. The twins had {{previously}} stolen the map from a drawer in Filch's office that contained dangerous confiscated objects; it is revealed by Lupin that Filch probably <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> but not how to work it. Snape later finds the map in Harry's possession and tries to force it to reveal its secrets, but the map merely mocks and insults him. Lupin (one of the creators of the map), the current Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, is called upon to investigate this [...] "dark object", and confiscates it to keep Harry safe, though he returns it to Harry after resigning his post at Hogwarts. From then on, the map becomes one of Harry's most useful tools in his ongoing adventures.|$|E
2500|$|Much to {{the chagrin}} of Warner Bros., Russell decided to use a number of {{experimental}} cinematic techniques in the film. Handheld cameras and Steadicam shots were used to give the film a journalistic feel. Russell shot a majority of the film on Ektachrome transparency stock that was cross processed in colour negative chemicals, to reproduce [...] "the odd colour of the newspaper images [...]" [...] Though the process produced a unique quality and look to the film, it was exceedingly unreliable to develop, and many film labs would not provide insurance for the transparency stock if it did not develop properly. Russell feared that the scenes would need to be reshot until finally a lab was found that would develop the transparency stock in the negative chemicals. The opening was shot on conventional negative stock and bleach bypassed to give a deep black and high contrast look. Some interior shots were also filmed on conventional negative stock and processed normally. Russell also credited the realism of the firefights to the film's cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, who had shot several documentaries on South American civil wars, saying [...] "he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like to be in that kind of world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luis Paez-Pumar of Rolling Stone {{described}} WrestleMania as [...] "two-faced as a Gemini"—the {{first half}} [...] "was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches {{that made you}} think that WWE <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> doing all along with this lackluster build", but once Triple H appeared, {{the rest of the}} event [...] "was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as [...] "should have retired when the Streak was broken", but [...] "lived on to pass the rub on to Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that [...] "WWE has no idea how to handle Bray Wyatt", writing that Orton [...] "definitely did not need the title" [...] and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of [...] "projected video screen grossness" [...] as [...] "the dumbest crap". Paez-Pumar called for [...] "fresh blood or new ideas" [...] in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he [...] "has not put on a good Mania match" [...] since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldberg–Lesnar was a [...] "revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine", Cena's proposal was [...] "magic in a way that no other entertainment can match", The New Day [...] "were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not", while [...] "a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of Raw" [...] due to the return of the Hardys.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.

2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' {{in the center of the}} country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
