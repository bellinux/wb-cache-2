5|$|The {{resulting}} Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E

The glands are lined by two cell layers: an outer low cuboidal layer and an inner layer of tall columnar mucin-secreting epithelium. Half of the volume of the prostate is occupied by the fibromuscular stroma between the glands. The prostate zones: The prostate consist of several zones, the peripheral zone, the central zone and the transition zone (Figure 2).

40|$|Abstract. Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris var. pekinensis (Lour.) Olson) is a {{vegetable}} {{which can be}} cultivated with success in Transylvanian Tableland specific conditions. Even if in our country it is considered a rare vegetable, probably because it is cultivated only by amateur gardeners, or is imported from other countries, it is appreciated by those who ate this tasteful vegetable. An other problem {{is the price of}} Chinese cabbage, which is <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>time</b> higher than the white headed cabbage price. The present research took place, in 2011, on the experimental field which belongs to the Vegetable Growing Department from the Faculty of Horticulture from the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine from Cluj-Napoca, in the spring. Five cultivars of Chinese cabbage were used to see if this almost unknown vegetable from our country can be cultivated with better results in open field or in protected culture. The experiments results showed that this type of cabbage can be cultivated with maximum success in protected areas, such as greenhouses or polyethylene tunnels. Even if the price of culture establishment is higher in case of the protected culture, the higher quality of the final products and the higher yield make these cultures more profitable ones compared with the open field cultures...|$|R

500|$|Morgan {{and his men}} {{remained}} in Porto Bello for a month. He wrote to Don Agustín, the acting president of Panama, to demand a ransom {{for the city of}} 350,000 pesos. As they stripped the city of its wealth it is probable that torture was used on the residents to uncover hidden caches of money and jewels. Zahedieh records that there were no first-hand reports from witnesses that confirmed Exquemelin's claim of widespread rape and debauchery. After an attempt by Don Agustín to recapture the city by force – his army of 800 soldiers was repelled by the privateers – he negotiated a ransom of 100,000 pesos. Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>times</b> the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan's letter of marque.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a structure, one of the most {{difficult}} parameter to assess is how the initial condition of a structure will change with time. During its life span, a structure can be subjected to different loads, changes in geometric configuration and even changes in its mechanical properties. Among all factors that can affect the geometrical reconfiguration of a structure (i. e. settlements and overloads) creep is one of the most important given its inevitability and because of its persistent effects (normally estimated as ten thousand days). Due to the effect of creep, a structure tends to amplify its deformation under a given load condition over time, and the final deformation can even reach values <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> <b>time</b> grater than the initial ones. During the design, the fact that deformations grow with time can be a difficult condition especially for highly indeterminate structures like cable stayed bridges where the stresses are related to the geometric configuration of the structure itself. In concrete cable stayed bridges, in fact, the increase in the deformation of the deck and the pylons over time leads to a decrease in the initial tension in the stays with an obvious difficulty in the design phase of the structure. The first chapter of this thesis illustrates and explains one approximate method used to estimate the effect of creep on a concrete structure. The method proposed in this thesis is the "Age-Adjusted Effective Modulus Method". It was chosen among others because it is one of the most commonly used, and because it is highly accessible. (cont.) In the second chapter, the Age-Adjusted Effective Modulus Method will be used in conjunction with the force method to study non homogeneous, indeterminate structure under the effect of creep. In this chapter a procedure will be introduced that enables the calculation of an initial value of the prestressing force in the stays that elides the effect of creep on tension.
