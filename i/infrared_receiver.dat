40|$|Several {{types of}} spectrometers {{developed}} for radio astronomy receivers which utilize RF filters, multiple oscillators and mixers, digital autocorrelators and acoustic/optic devices are considered. The RF spectrometer developed at GSFC to provide wide bandwidths (greater than 1 GHz) {{as well as}} high resolution (5 MHz) is described. The 128 channel filter bank is divided into high and low resolution sections. The high resolution section is tunable by providing a second mixer ahead of the filter bank. This is necessary because <b>infrared</b> <b>receivers</b> which use gas lasers as local oscillators are only tunable to specific laser frequencies. To compensate for astronomical Doppler shifts and molecule frequency differences a second local oscillator and mixer is needed. A diagram of the RF section of the filter bank is shown.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{innovative}} approach for noise cancellation at <b>infrared</b> (IR) wireless <b>receivers.</b> Ambient noise due to artificial lighting {{and the sun}} {{has been a major}} concern in infrared systems. The background induced shot noise typically has a power from 20 to 40 dB more than the signal induced shot noise and varies with time. Due to these changing conditions, <b>infrared</b> wireless <b>receivers</b> experience high level of non-stationary noise. The objective of the work mentioned in this paper is to develop digital signal processing algorithms at the infrared wireless system to combat high power non-stationary noise. The noisy signal is decomposed using a joint time and frequency representation such as wavelets and wavelet packets, into transform domain coefficients and the lower order coefficients are removed by applying a threshold. Denoised version is obtained by reconstructing the signal with the remaining coefficients. In this paper, we evaluate different wavelet methods for denoising at an <b>infrared</b> wireless <b>receiver.</b> Simulation results indicate that if the noise is uncorrelated with the signal and the channel model is unavailable the wavelet denoising method with different wavelet analyzing functions improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) from 4 dB to 7. 8 dB...|$|R
25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) {{remote controls}} use light, they require {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. <b>Infrared</b> <b>receivers</b> also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} biologically-motivated {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} perception-based homing by an autonomous mobile robot. A three-layered self-organizing network is used to autonomously learn the desired mapping from perceptions to actions. The network, which bears some similarities to the structure of the mammalian cerebellum, is initially trained by teleoperating the robot on a small number of homing paths within a given domain of interest. During training, the connections between input sensory layer and the hidden layer as well as those between the hidden layer and the motor output layer are modified according to the well-known competitive Hebbian learning rule. By employing a population averaging scheme for computing output motor vectors, the robot can subsequently home from arbitrary locations within the domain based solely on current perceptions.
