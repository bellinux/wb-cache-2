40|$|Three {{dimensional}} optic measurement system's {{accuracy is}} highly related with the <b>field</b> of <b>inspection.</b> Increasing of <b>field</b> <b>inspection</b> costs increasing camera / projector pixel {{area on the}} test surface. Small surface changes within one pixel area cannot be directly detected, which will lower the system accuracy. A pixel-to-pixel strategy is developed to solve this problem. Increasing <b>field</b> of <b>inspection</b> also costs a longer standoff distance. The random image noise from the environment, uncertainties functions by lens distortion and resolution variation are all amplified. Therefore, a more complicated calibration model for each pixel is proposed to calibrate the system. In traditional structured light vision systems, a single sensor usually detects around 10, 000 - 50, 000 mm 2, and the 3 D vision sensor in this paper needs to detect around 2, 400, 000 mm 2. Larger detection range gives more challenge to finish the calibration tasks. This paper proposes a clear calibration procedure to a large <b>field</b> of <b>inspection</b> structured light system.
