40|$|The {{objective}} of this work to develop the materials processing and design technologies required to reduce the die development time for metal mold processes from 12 months to 3 months, using die casting of Al and Mg as the example process. Sandia demonstrated that investment casting, using rapid prototype patterns produced from Stereo lithography or Selective laser Sintering, was a viable alternative/supplement to the current technology of machining form wrought stock. A demonstration die insert (ejector halt) was investment cast and subsequently tested in the die casting environment.

In this paper, the experimental studies of tool wear mechanism and tool life in ball nose end milling of Inconel 718 is presented under minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) condition.

In this variant, each job has three operations, where the first operation must be performed on the first machine, the second operation can be performed on either machine but cannot be preempted, and the third operation must be performed on the second machine. The NP-hard nature of the problem motivates the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. It is shown that a schedule in which the operations are sequenced arbitrarily, but without <b>inserted</b> <b>machine</b> idle time, has a worst-case performance ratio of 2.

40|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is a {{promising}} tool material which is utilized to cut difficult-to-machine {{materials used in}} aerospace industry. Because of its ultra-hardness, electrical discharge grinding (EDG), a variation of electrical discharge machining, is often adopted to manufacture PCD tools to reduce manufacturing time. This paper investigates the quality of PCD inserts manufactured by two different EDG eroding methods: " 2 -step machining" and " 3 -step machining". Surface roughness and residual stress were investigated after EDG process. An orthogonal cutting experiment was conducted to test the performance of each PCD <b>insert.</b> PCD tools <b>machined</b> with the two methods do not have significant difference in surface roughness. The residual stress status changed from compressive to tensile after EDG process. Also, after being eroded by 3 -step EDG process, there was an over 30 % declination of residual stress compared with 2 -step machining. The results of the orthogonal cutting test showed that the wear amount and the thrust force of PCD <b>inserts</b> <b>machined</b> by 3 -step EDG were smaller for the CTB 010 insert and the CTX 002 insert. In contrast, the CTM 302 machined by 3 -step EDG did not show obvious improvement in tool wear resistance during the cutting tests...|$|R

However, several grinding cycles are often required to reduce the form error to an acceptable value, significantly dependent on the tool path compensation technique used. This paper reports on a novel form error compensation technique for tungsten carbide mould <b>insert</b> <b>machining</b> utilizing a parallel grinding method. In this technique, a newly developed program is used to process the profile data measured using a Form Talysurf profilometer, and to further generate the NC tool path for form error compensation. The developed technique focuses on the compensation of form error resulted by two major error sources, wheel radius and waviness errors. Using the developed technique, the initial residual form error upon the completion of primary grinding is minimized. Subsequently, the residual form error is compensated by modifying the NC tool path. With this technique, the speed of convergence of the residual form error has improved markedly. The grinding result shows that, after just one compensation cycle, a form error of approximately 0. 3 mu m in PV is achieved...|$|R

The neutron sensitivity of boron-lined detectors has been enhanced {{by a factor of}} 3 without a corresponding increase in the unwanted gamma sensitivity by the use of multiple cathode assemblies and additional structures within their sensitive volume. This has also helped in substituting 90 % enriched 10 B isotope with indigenously available 40 % material.

The use of PEEK <b>inserts</b> <b>machined</b> to suit the extra cameral volume in gamma compensated ion chambers has improved the V/I characteristics and compensation factor.

40|$|The {{just-in-time}} concept decrees not {{to accept}} ordered goods before their due dates {{in order to avoid}} inventory cost. This bounces the inventory cost back to the manufacturer: products that are completed before their due dates have to be stored. Reducing this type of storage cost by preclusion of early completion conflicts with the traditional policy of keeping work-in-process inventories down. This paper addresses a single-machine scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing total inventory cost, comprising cost associated with work-in-process inventories and storage cost as a result of early completion. The cost components are measured by the sum of the job completion times and the sum of the job earlinesses. This problem differs from more traditional scheduling problems, since the insertion of machine idle time may reduce total cost. The search for an optimal schedule, however, can be limited to the set of job sequences, since for any sequence there is a clear-cut way to <b>insert</b> <b>machine</b> idle time in order to minimize total inventory cost. We apply branch-and-bound to identify an optimal schedule. We present five approaches for lower bound calculation, based upon relaxation of the objective function, of the state space, and upon Lagrangian relaxation.
