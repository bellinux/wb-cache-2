5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were in {{position}} {{to carry out a}} left <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> on Longuerval. The village was clear of Germans so they pressed on towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery and assault gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of their own, and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 01:00 on 15 December, the New Zealand Division—electing {{not to make}} {{a further}} frontal assault on Orsogna—launched their 5th Brigade in Operation Florence, a new <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> {{to the right of the}} village. By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well {{established}} on the Orsogna to Ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line. Although they had exhausted nearly all their reserves, divisional headquarters was optimistic for the prospects for the next day, given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September, XXXVI Corps {{launched}} a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying {{to circumvent the}} Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} XI Corps, the attack focused on Gen. Schimmelfennig's division. They were {{subjected}} to a deadly artillery crossfire from Rodes' and Early's batteries, and as they deployed they were attacked by Doles' infantry. Early's troops were able to employ a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> and roll up the division from the right, and they fell back in confusion toward the town. A desperate counterattack by the 157th New York from von Amsberg's brigade was surrounded on three sides, causing it to suffer 307 casualties (75%).|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of the}} Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead.|$|E

5|$|During the {{planning}} {{stage of the}} Normandy invasion, {{the decision was made}} to land the 6th Airborne Division (Major-General Richard Gale) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives. Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> on the landing area. Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory, so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter-attacks. Gale decided that the only way to capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault. He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Elwell {{advanced}} inland {{rapidly and}} was soon also engaged, losing one killed and two wounded in a brief skirmish. During the advance the Australians had also uncovered and defused a large pipe mine the Germans had buried under a narrow track and set to detonate using a command wire. These mines had been laid beneath the road with wires leading to an electric battery and a firing key {{at the bottom of}} a lookout tree. By 13:00 however, Hill's position was reached and the Australians—now under Elwell's overall command—launched another <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> on the main trench blocking the road. Despite suffering heavy casualties they pressed their attack, forcing the defenders to surrender after charging the trench with fixed bayonets. A German officer and 20Melanesians were captured. Four Australians were killed, including Elwell who died leading the charge with his sword drawn, and another five were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E

5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering {{equipment for the}} river crossings inhibited a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> of Warsaw from the west, which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force, not all that much smaller than either, would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw {{the possibility of a}} surprise <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> in this region. For the Germans this would have the advantage of bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as they are just opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August {{a patrol}} from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in {{crossing}} the eastern {{branch of the}} river, and was quickly reinforced {{by the rest of}} the battalion. They fought for three hours to gain a proper foothold and were then forced to withdraw again. The next day, patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night, and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north, closely followed {{by the rest of the}} brigade. On 25August the 1st Special Service Brigade took over as the lead formation, and headed towards Beuzeville, but once again German defences held up the advance. The 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 4th Special Service Brigade carried out a left <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> to capture the village, suffering heavy losses from German mortar fire.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{difference}} from the earlier Sinyavino Offensive was {{the location of the}} main attack. In September 1942 the Soviet forces were attacking south of the town of Siniavino, which allowed them to potentially encircle several German divisions, but also left the army open to <b>flanking</b> <b>attacks</b> from the north, and it was this which ultimately caused the offensive to fail. In January 1943 the offensive was conducted north of Siniavino, closer to the Ladoga Lake shore, which removed the threat of <b>flanking</b> <b>attacks</b> and increased the probability of success, but forced the Soviets to abandon the idea of encircling most of the German forces in the [...] "bottleneck".|$|R
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, {{it was clear that}} the breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps had been successful, and the XX Corps was ordered to begin the Battle of Nablus by attacking the well-defended Ottoman front line, supported by an artillery barrage. These attacks continued late into the night and throughout the next day, until the early hours of 21 September when the continuing successful <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault and aerial bombing attacks, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area down the Wadi el Fara road towards the Jordan River, aiming to cross at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, leaving a rearguard to defend Nablus. The town was captured by the XX Corps and the 5th Light Horse Brigade, while devastating aerial bombing of the Wadi el Fara road, blocked that line of retreat. As all objectives had now been won, no further attacks were required of the XX Corps, which captured thousands of prisoners in the area and at Nablus and Balata.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{phase of the}} Battle of Passchendaele, Andrew's {{battalion}} was engaged in fighting around the village of La Basseville, a few kilometres southwest of Messines. Originally captured by the New Zealanders prior to the battle on 26 July, the village had been re-taken by the Germans the next day. Under cover of an artillery barrage, the Wellingtons began an advance towards the village. Andrew was tasked with leading two sections to destroy a machine-gun post. During the advance, he noticed another machine-gun post that was holding up the advance of another platoon. On his own initiative, he promptly diverted his force and removed the newly spotted threat with a <b>flanking</b> <b>attack.</b> He then continued with his men to his original objective. Braving continuous gunfire, {{he and his men}} captured the machine-gun post. While most of his men withdrew with the gun, he and another man continued to scout further forward. Coming across another machine-gun post, the two men destroyed it before returning to their lines with useful information on the increasing numbers of Germans in the area.|$|E
5|$|In Arnhem {{at around}} 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, {{just as they}} started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the {{battalion}} had just arrived and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered {{to carry out a}} left <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> to relieve the pressure on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had been trapped, stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure. At 11:00 the Major-General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north-west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|O'Donnell {{attempted}} {{to probe the}} Viet Cong flank, and after locating it on the high ground he committed 1 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Rod Smith—to conduct a right <b>flanking</b> <b>attack.</b> Beginning at 11:30 the Australian assault soon ran into another Viet Cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre, and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking the manoeuvre of the other. A heavy monsoon rain began, drenching the men as they faced each other at a range of just , with seven Viet Cong machine-guns facing six Australian machine-guns {{at the height of}} the battle as the two Viet Cong platoons clashed with two Australian platoons. The Australians suffered heavily, losing two section commanders killed and a dozen men wounded in the first few minutes. The fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded shots, with neither the Australians nor the Viet Cong able to achieve a decisive advantage.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by {{artillery}} fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful <b>flanking</b> <b>attack</b> on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up {{as many as four}} deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 10–11 November a Russian column under Strik's command began its passage through the narrow canyons, intent on {{arriving}} at Dürenstein by noon; two more columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, moved in wider semicircles, planning {{to pass through the}} mountains and attack the French, who were extended along the river bank. According to the plan, in late morning Strik's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right. This <b>flanking</b> <b>attack,</b> combined with Miloradovich's frontal assault from Stein, would force the French into a vise; encircled, they would have no option but to surrender—or die. To ensure the success of the plan, the second and third columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults. In this way, even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach, they would not escape the vise-like grip of the Coalition army.|$|E

50|$|When {{the terrain}} favoured neither side {{it was down}} to the {{disposition}} of forces in the battle line to prevent <b>flanking</b> <b>attacks.</b> For {{as long as they}} had a place on the battlefield, it was the role of cavalry to be placed on the flanks of the infantry battle line. With speed and greater tactical flexibility, the cavalry could both make <b>flanking</b> <b>attacks</b> and guard against them. It was the marked superiority of Hannibal’s cavalry at Cannae that allowed him to chase off the Roman cavalry and complete the encirclement of the Roman legions. With equally matched cavalry, commanders have been content to allow inaction, with the cavalry of both sides preventing the other from action.|$|R
