500|$|Fillmore {{hoped to}} gain the {{endorsement}} of the New York delegation to the national convention, but Weed wanted the vice presidency for Seward, with Fillmore as governor. Seward, however, withdrew prior to the 1844 Whig National Convention. [...] When Weed's replacement vice presidential hopeful, Willis Hall, fell ill, Weed sought to defeat Fillmore's candidacy to force him to run for governor. Weed's attempts to boost Fillmore as a gubernatorial candidate caused the former congressman to write, [...] "I am not willing to be treacherously killed by this pretended kindness... do not suppose <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> I think they desire my nomination for governor." [...] New York sent a delegation to Baltimore pledged to support Clay, but with no instructions as to how to vote for vice president. Weed told out-of-state delegates that the New York party preferred to have Fillmore as its gubernatorial candidate, and after Clay was nominated for president, the second place on the ticket fell to former New Jersey senator Theodore Frelinghuysen.|$|E
500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melinda Newman of Hitfix was {{positive}} in her review, {{saying that the}} song [...] "It {{lives up to its}} title: You'll want to put on your dancing shoes and dance again. The song isn’t as interesting musically as the pair’s previous hit collaboration, “On the Floor” but it is more consistent in its commitment to being a full-on dance twirler [...] It’s totally charming, especially the [...] "woo..ooh" [...] background singing." [...] Newman compared the chorus of the song to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010). Gina Serpe of E! News said [...] "don't think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> the meaning behind the song was lost on Lopez, who's been through some personal travails of her own this past year," [...] and briefly commented that the song was [...] "Likely already destined to hit the top of the charts." [...] Similarly, Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press commented that the song was a [...] "sure-to-be-hit song." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush labelled [...] "Dance Again" [...] {{as one of the best}} dance songs of 2012. She stated that: [...] "The song has an infectious beat that'll get you moving and grooving." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it," [...] she added, aloud. [...] "It is not 'the devil,' as you call it, but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty. I used to feel just so, and once, I really did think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> I would bolt." ...|$|E
60|$|It was but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>that</b> {{they stood}} so, but the {{duration}} of that minute was sufficient to make it ever memorable to them both.

60|$|But when he {{had stood}} thus for a time a noise in the house roused him; he turned instinctively {{and went into the}} drawing-room.

He remembered everything, the hour, the minute even, what point they had reached, and what was to come.

60|$|Harry {{next morning}} mounted a horse of Herbert's {{and started to}} ride from the town, after taking an affectionate {{farewell}} of his hosts.

60|$|Poor Chuffey was {{conducted}} to his accustomed corner, and there he remained, silent and quiet, save at long intervals, when he would rise, and walk about the room, and wring his hands, or raise some strange and sudden cry.

50|$|Mallory and her partner, Sergeant Riker, find {{links to}} a double murder that {{occurred}} 12 {{years ago in}} an art gallery owned by the same man.
