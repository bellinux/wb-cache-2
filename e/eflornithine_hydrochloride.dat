40|$|Abstract This work {{describes}} the development, validation and stable studies of a new, simple and reliable UV spectroscopy procedure {{for the analysis}} of <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> A new rapid, precise, accurate, specific and simple UV Spectrophotometric analytical method was validated to assay <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (DFMO) in parenteral. Measurements were taken at λmax 283 using ethanol as the solvent. Beer’s law is obeyed in the concentration ranges 4 – 32 µg mL- 1 with a correlation coefficient (r) equal to 1. The values of limit of detection (LOD) were 0. 0675 µg mL- 1 and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0. 2045 µg mL- 1 for DFMO respectively. The value of molar absorptivity and sandell’s sensitivity was 0. 3918 × 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 and 0. 1633 µg cm- 2 respectively. The developed method was validated as per International Conference of Harmonization guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision and robustness. The accuracy of the method was 100. 23 %. The precision demonstrated a relative standard deviation of less than 1 %. The results were satisfactory when compared with the literature. The proposed method might be applied in routine quality control in the pharmaceutical industries since it is precise, accurate, simple and economic. Commercial formulation and laboratory prepared mixtures were successfully analyzed using the developed methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A simple highly sensitive, rapid, precise, {{accurate}} and specific RP-HPLC method {{was developed for}} quantification of <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (2 -difluoromethyl-DL-ornithine; DFMO) in its commercial formulation. In this RP-HPLC method, the separation was performed using BDS Hypersil 5 µ C 18 (150 X 4. 6 mm) column at room temperature by using methanol: 2 % of Glacial acetic acid in water (80 : 20 v/v) as mobile phase. The flow rate was 0. 8 mL min- 1 with UV detection at 290 nm. The retention time of DFMO was 4. 3. Linearity was observed over concentration range of 50 - 100 µg mL- 1 for DFMO. The LOD and LOQ {{were found to be}} 0. 008438 µg mL- 1 and 0. 028126 µg mL- 1 respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was determined by recovery studies and found to be 100. 5 % for DFMO. The proposed method was validated for ICH guidelines like linearity, limit of detection, accuracy, precision, ruggedness, robustness, and system suitability...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a spectrophotometric method for the quantitative determination of <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as a pure compound and in pharmaceutical formulations. Methods: The method involved {{the reaction of}} the target compound with vanillin reagent at specific pH 5. 6 to produce a green reddish color chromogen. The derivative chromogen exhibits absorption maxima at 578 nm. At the pH of the reaction, there was no degradation. The developed method was validated as per International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, precision and robustness. Results: Under the indicated conditions, the proposed method was linear over the concentration range of 5 - 25 μg/ml and the correlation coefficient (r 2) was> 0. 998 (n = 6) with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1. 003 % (n = 6). Mean recovery of the target compound was 100. 58 % with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4. 3 μg/ml and limit of detection (LOD) of 1. 2 μg/ml. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the stability-indicating power of the proposed method which is precise, accurate, simple and economic. Thus, the method {{can be applied to the}} routine analysis o...|$|E
40|$|Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> [Ornidyl]), {{a suicide}} {{inhibitor}} {{of the key}} polyamine biosynthesis enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), is effective in treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a common opportunistic infection associated with AIDS. Despite DFMO's specificity for ODC, the reason for its selective toxicity against P. carinii is unknown since both host and parasite are dependent on the same enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis. A new high-performance liquid chromatography method was used with P. carinii cells isolated from infected rat lungs to measure polyamine content, to confirm the presence of ODC, and to {{examine the effect of}} DFMO on polyamine concentrations. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were found to be present at 2. 00 +/- 0. 54, 1. 26 +/- 0. 51, and 1. 59 +/- 0. 91 nmol (mg of protein) - 1, respectively, neither unusually high nor low values. ODC's specific activity was 79 +/- 11 pmol (mg of protein) - 1 h- 1, again not a remarkable value. However, the rates of both DFMO-induced polyamine depletion and subsequent repletion upon DFMO removal were unusually high. A 3 -h exposure to 1 mM DFMO in vitro caused the depletion of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine to levels 12, 29, and 16 %, respectively, of that of control cells. After DFMO removal and incubation for 1 h in serum-free media, polyamine levels returned to 78, 88, and 64 %, respectively, of that of the control cells not exposed to DFMO. Since such depletions and repletions usually occur over periods of days rather than hours, these rapid changes may provide a clue to the selective action of DFMO against P. carinii and may guide the development of new compounds and an optimal drug administration schedule for DFMO...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} if {{the absorption of}} the human African trypanosomiasis agent eflornithine was stereospecific and dose dependent after oral administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered single doses of racemic <b>eflornithine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as an oral solution (750, 1, 500, 2, 000, or 3, 000 mg/kg of body weight) or intravenously (375 or 1, 000 mg/kg of body weight). Sparse blood samples were obtained for determination of eflornithine enantiomers by liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detection (lower limit of quantification [LLOQ], 83 μM for 300 μl plasma). The full plasma concentration-time profile of racemic eflornithine following frequent sampling was determined for another group of rats, using a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV method (LLOQ, 5 μM for 50 μl plasma). Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in NONMEM for the combined racemic and enantiomeric concentrations. Upon intravenous administration, the plasma concentration-time profile of eflornithine was biphasic, with marginal differences in enantiomer kinetics (mean clearances of 14. 5 and 12. 6 ml/min/kg for l- and d-eflornithine, respectively). The complex absorption kinetics were modeled {{with a number of}} transit compartments to account for delayed absorption, transferring the drug into an absorption compartment from which the rate of influx was saturable. The mean bioavailabilities for l- and d-eflornithine were 41 % and 62 %, respectively, in the dose range of 750 to 2, 000 mg/kg of body weight, with suggested increases to 47 % and 83 %, respectively, after a dose of 3, 000 mg/kg of body weight. Eflornithine exhibited enantioselective absorption, with the more potent l-isomer being less favored, a finding which may help to explain why clinical attempts to develop an oral treatment have hitherto failed. The mechanistic explanation for the stereoselective absorption remains unclear...|$|E
