With the increase in [...] "Buddy Punching"( [...] a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely <b>foul</b> <b>proof</b> and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: Evaluating {{double check}} workload, {{it was less}} time {{consuming}} then expected although {{the frequency of the}} check brings more interruptions. Every interruption brings a disturbance to nurse's concentration and work, this could potentially increase patient risk. Therefore the amount of interruptions should be reduced to a minimum. Meanwhile, technology makes giant leaps. This has the potential to replace the double check. BCMA is making progress and is more efficient and <b>foul</b> <b>proof</b> than human checks. Because of the wide spread variety in results its hard to draw further Conclusions: It is even doubtful whether further studies make sense, given the current advances in technology. If available, BCMA technique (combined with CPOE) should be implemented as soon as possible. If not available, than hospitals should focus on a select part of medication checking based on specific risks and workflow [3].|$|E

40|$|Boron doped diamond (BDD), {{due to its}} {{exceptional}} electrochemical response (extended solvent {{window and}} low background current) and thermal properties (large thermal diffusivity and extreme resistance to thermal ablation), is investigated as the electrode material for thermoelectrochemical studies. A pulsed infrared (IR) laser technique is used to heat the electrode from the back (nonsolution) side. The non-isothermal pulsed technique enables mass transport to be more readily controlled as opposed to isothermal heating approaches such as a water bath. The effect of temperature on fundamental electrochemical processes, such as mass transport, electron transfer (ET) kinetics and thermodynamics of both outer sphere and inner sphere redox mediators is investigated on both BDD macro- and micro- electrodes. The effective temperature increase at electrode surface can be determined both experimentally and theoretically using finite element models. Enhanced mass transport and ET process at elevated temperatures, {{in addition to the}} temperature coefficient of the redox mediators, {{play a crucial role in}} the temperature dependent electrochemical response. Thermoelectrochemical studies are extended to an electroactive species which forms a solid structure after electrolysis. In particular, the cathodic electrodeposition of lead/lead oxide (Pb/PbO) under non-isothermal heating conditions in nitrate containing solutions is investigated. The effect of deposition potential, time, dissolved oxygen content and temperature are explored to understand the mechanism for the synthesis of crystalline PbO “plate” structures, and the role of electrodeposited Pb. Further work explores the effect of temperature on an electroactive species which upon electrolysis forms a solid product which fouls the electrode surface. Using a BDD microelectrode it is possible to show how temperature can be used to minimise the effect of surface blocking after the oxidation of a neurotransmitter, dopamine, which is known to lead to electrode <b>fouling.</b> Finally, <b>proof</b> of concept studies are undertaken to assess the suitability of a thermoelectrochemical approach to the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Initial studies investigate immobilisation strategies for both (in separate experiments) electrochemically active self-assembled monolayers (SAM) and redox-labelled double stranded DNA on gold and BDD electrodes...|$|R
