5|$|In October 1827, Smith and {{his wife}} moved from Palmyra to Harmony (now Oakland), Pennsylvania, aided by a {{relatively}} prosperous neighbor, Martin Harris. Living near his in-laws, Smith transcribed some characters that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> engraved on the plates, and then dictated a translation to his wife.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in this way, the test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>were</b> more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E

5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold it together by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged {{to go on with}} negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E
5|$|The {{next seven}} games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Fischer {{was unable to}} get the initiative. Spassky was {{choosing}} lines that Fischer was unable to break. With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate. The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected to what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants– removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.|$|E
25|$|Mike Quigley, {{the past}} CEO, {{publicly}} attacked the NBN and the MTM, noting cost blowouts and delays that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> {{the fault of}} changes made by the Coalition government to the rollout plan.|$|E

25|$|After Eyler's death, {{his defense}} {{attorney}} Kathleen Zellner revealed {{the names of}} 17 males whom Eyler had confessed to murdering and four who <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> murdered by an unidentified accomplice. That person was later revealed to be Robert David Little, an older college professor and longtime associate.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 an American {{businessman}} {{spread the}} tabular {{form of the}} twelve promises throughout the world, in 238 languages. In 1890 Cardinal Adolph Perraud deplored this circulation of the promises in tabular form, which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> different from the words {{and the meaning of}} the expressions used by Saint Margaret Mary, and wanted the promises to be published in their original words.|$|E
25|$|In Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed {{because of}} various scandals. Another six, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>were</b> lost because incumbents did not {{recognize}} and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, The Democrats would have gained around a dozen seats and Republicans could have kept narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.|$|E

25|$|Wolfe {{also wrote}} two critiques of and social {{histories}} {{of modern art}} and modern architecture, The Painted Word and From Bauhaus to Our House, published in 1975 and 1981, respectively. The Painted Word mocked the excessive insularity {{of the art world}} and its dependence on what he saw as faddish critical theory. In From Bauhaus to Our House he explored what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> the negative effects of the Bauhaus style on the evolution of modern architecture.|$|E
25|$|Two legends exist which feature Isabella de Forz. One, {{that of the}} Seven Crosses, {{of which}} there are many variations, relates that she came across a poor man {{carrying}} a basket containing what <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> puppies, but which were in fact seven of his children whom he was going to drown because he could not afford to keep them. After severely upbraiding him for his lack of morality, Isabella adopted the children and ensured that they were looked after and well educated until their adulthood when she found employment for all of them.|$|E
25|$|Also in September 2005, former {{president}} Leonid Kravchuk accused exiled Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky of financing Yushchenko's presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yushchenko's official backers. Berezovsky confirmed {{that he met}} Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, {{but he refused to}} confirm or deny that the money was used in Yushchenko's campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} after the multi-millionaire's death that Dr. Washington said he felt {{compelled}} to reveal publicly some {{of the extent of}} Henry Rogers' contributions for his causes. The funds, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>were</b> at that very time paying for the operation of at least 65 small country schools for the education and betterment of African Americans in Virginia and other portions of the South, all unknown to the recipients. Dr. Washington also disclosed that, known only to a few trustees, Henry Rogers had also generously provided support to institutions of higher education such as the schools which are now Hampton University and Tuskegee University.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{graves and}} many others were {{probably}} rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across {{the width of the}} altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850. Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive. In 1866 amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle {{tracking}} and maintenance issue had not improved by August 2013. The Washington Post {{reported that the}} Ellerbe never ordered the 16 fire engines and seven ladder trucks which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> needed in 2011. Ellerbe blamed the city council and an unspecified dispute with a vendor for the two-and-a-half year delay. He also asserted that six new fire engines and two new ladder trucks had been ordered, but did not say {{how long it would}} be until they arrived. The newspaper also reported that Ellerbe had yet to fix the vehicular tracking database problem. The department spent $160,000 on a consultant to inventory the department's equipment, but no permanent staff person had been hired to oversee the project and keep it going.|$|E

25|$|Through {{unprecedented}} {{intervention by}} the U.S. Treasury, Paulson led government efforts which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>were</b> aimed at avoiding a severe economic slowdown. After the Dow Jones dropped 30% and turmoil ensued {{in the global}} markets, Paulson pushed through legislation authorizing the Treasury to use $700 billion to stabilize the financial system. Working with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, he influenced the decision to create a credit facility (bridge loan and warrants) of US$85 billion to American International Group so it would avoid filing bankruptcy, after having been told that AIG held teacher pension plans, 401k plans, $1.5 trillion in life insurance plans for Americans, and the French Finance Minister called to let Paulson know that AIG held the interests of many Eurozone countries.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Hirst {{explained}} {{how it was}} commonly misunderstood that he had run Wolfsburg as a British Army Major. The defeated German staff, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>were</b> initially sullen and unresponsive, having been conditioned by many years of Nazism and they were sometimes unresponsive to orders. At Nordhoff's suggestion, he sent back to England for his officer's uniform and from then on, had no difficulty in having his instructions followed. Hirst can be seen photographed at Wolfsburg in his uniform, although he was not actually a soldier at the time but a civilian member of the Military Government. The title of 'Major' was sometimes used by someone who had left the Army as a courtesy title. In fact, Hirst chose not to do so.|$|E
