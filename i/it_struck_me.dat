5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
25|$|While {{there have}} been {{animated}} cartoons based on these giant robots, {{no one has ever}} attempted a live-action feature about them. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that it was a natural fantasy for the big screen–and a terrific opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} special effects that are available today.|$|E
25|$|I had not {{a dispute}} but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, {{and at once}} <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, {{especially}} in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.|$|E

500|$|Glazunov and Lyadov were {{friendly}} with Tchaikovsky and were charmed by him. Glazunov studied Tchaikovsky's works and [...] "found much that was new... that was instructive {{for us as}} young musicians. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{his time}} in the Army, Gore later stated, [...] "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform." [...] He also later stated that his {{experience}} in Vietnam didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that opponents to the war, including myself, really did {{not take into account the}} fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed to moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Unusual Suspects" [...] an A-, and {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "is a love letter to {{the very idea of}} paranoia". Furthermore, VanDerWerff argued that [...] "as the episode moved its way to its climax, when Mr. X improbably lets the Gunmen live after seeing as much as they did [...] <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that what we’re seeing here may not entirely be meant to be taken seriously, just as 'Memoirs Of A Cigarette Smoking Man' [...] is more about who the CSM wished he might have been than the person he actually was. This isn’t a true story; it’s a manifesto." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, and, while calling the entry [...] "an interesting diversion from the normal format of the series", he noted that [...] "there are still some issues with the plausibility of the story, and ultimately, the questions surrounding Mulder overshadow the character development of the Gunmen themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that if the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E
2500|$|I {{reminded}} them that I haven't played a meaningful soccer game in {{almost two years}} and I certainly couldn't fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I {{began to think about}} their inquiries and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that perhaps this is something I should consider. I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe I could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "That's {{one of the}} {{differences}} between you; you're not assertive. <b>It</b> has <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that you don't always realize your value." ...|$|R

2500|$|Then he {{came upon}} a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. [...] "You could never believe," [...] {{he wrote to his}} friend and {{long-term}} correspondent Marchesi, [...] "the impression that this book made. Then <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that I had every reason to consider myself badly guided" [...] before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction from Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack by David Schwartz {{does not}} include any songs by the Beatles because [...] "the producers could not get clearance from the notoriously difficult copyright holders, a company owned by Michael Jackson." [...] Critic Jim DeRogatis notes that, [...] "the movie was over before <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> that the soundtrack was devoid of any Beatles songs [...] Such is our saturation in all things Beatles-related that their actual music isn't even missed in the movie. And maybe that should {{tell us something about}} getting back to what really matters in this group's legacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dani first {{appeared}} in the 1999 song [...] "Californication", which includes the lyrics [...] "Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information" [...] although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single [...] "By the Way" [...] as [...] "Dani the girl". Kiedis commented: [...] "When this funky groove came up <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as a perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't realize that I was writing about the same girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early into New York Islanders {{training}} camp, goaltender Evgeni Nabokov, having {{played the}} previous {{season in the}} KHL, was deeply saddened by the news and {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I think I knew 80 percent of the team. Either I played with them or I played against them. You see each other in different tournaments. Some of them you're really close with, or some them you just say hi and have a couple of laughs with. [...] <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> when I found out. I was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough. You have chills and you just hope that the families will find the strength to fight through something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1906 Iowa {{game was}} {{refereed}} {{by one of}} the top football officials in the country, West Point's Lt. Horatio B. [...] "Stuffy" [...] Hackett, who {{became a member of the}} American Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee in December 1907. Hackett later told a reporter, [...] "It was the most perfect exhibition... of the new rules ... that I have seen all season and much better than that of Yale and Harvard. [...] St. Louis' style of pass differs entirely from that in use in the east. ... The St. Louis university players shoot the ball hard and accurately to the man who is to receive it ... The fast throw by St. Louis enables the receiving player to dodge the opposing players, and <b>it</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> as being all but perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{watching}} Michigan's 12–11 {{victory over}} Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, {{who was at}} the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write [...] "The Victors," [...] which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. [...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' <b>It</b> <b>struck</b> <b>me</b> quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E
