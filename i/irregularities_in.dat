5|$|Gravitationally induced <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> Uranus's {{observed}} orbit led {{eventually to}} the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and presumed <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The <b>irregularities</b> <b>in</b> the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E

Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks.

Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E

A position measuring device (10) calculates position data (P) of the imaging sensor, and an evaluation device (14) evaluates the imaging data. A storage unit (19) digitalizes storage of the imaging and position data. A control module (18) compares stored target-position data with active calculating position data during retrieval of <b>irregularity</b> (Z) <b>in</b> a cavity of an object by the image sensor. The imaging sensor is arranged on an end side of a flexible channel (7).

40|$|English {{abstract}} This thesis {{covers the}} topic of compensation for damage (non-pecuniary damage) caused {{in the exercise of}} public authority by an <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> the conduct of proceedings, evaluating substantive rules contained in the Act No. 82 / 1998 Coll. as well as specific features of procedure concerning damage compensation with regard to jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, and the European Court of Human Rights. This thesis is divided into eight parts. Following the explanation of basic terms such as liability, damage, and liability for damage caused in the exercise of public authority by an <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> a decision or the conduct of proceedings, the thesis goes on to describe the legal sources regarding the compensation for damage caused in the exercise of public authority by an <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> the conduct of proceedings. Further, the liability for damage caused in the exercise of public authority by an <b>irregularity</b> <b>in</b> the conduct of proceedings and the claim for compensation for damage is analysed. The main part of this thesis is devoted to the manner and extent of compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. Next, the right to recourse and the limitation period applicable to compensation for damage (non-pecuniary damage) [...] ...|$|R
