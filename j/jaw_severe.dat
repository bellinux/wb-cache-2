40|$|Introduction: Ectodermal {{dysplasia}} (ED) is {{an inherited}} disruption {{of two or}} more tissues and structures of ectodermal origin during their embryonal development. Hypodontia or anodontia of the primary and permanent teeth, poorly developed alveolar ridges and inappropriate мaxillo-mandibular relations are the most common oral manifestations. Management of patients with ED (depending on the phenotypic characteristics) needs a multidisciplinary team approach that involves maxillo-facial surgeon, pedodontist, orthodontist and prosthodontist. Case report: A 6 -year-old girl with ectodermal dysplasia having a normal intellectual development has typical facial expresion: square forehead, prominent ears and supraorbital ridges, pigmented and wrinkled eyelids, nose with anteverted nostrils, thin inward lips, and pointed chin. Hypotrichosis is characterized by almost no eyebrows, eyelashes and skin hairs; the sculp is covered with a wig. The skin is dry, thin and rough as a result of decreased function of the sweat glands. Finger and toe nails are short, thick and striated. Decreased lower facial height, together with deep mentolabial and nasolabial folds contributed to an old-looking facial expression. Complete bilateral cleft palate was partially solved on 1. 5 year of age, with remained oro-nasal communication and a presence of soft palate only. An alveolar ridge in the mandible is rather atrophic with deciduous canines destroyed by caries and and carious permanent molar teeth in both <b>jaws</b> (<b>severe</b> hypodontia). The gingiva is rather swollen, with dark-red color especially around the teeth. Treatment procedure: Taking into consideration the patient’s age and clinical findings, removable complete over-denture prosthesis was the treatment of choice. The preliminary impressions were taken with stock trays and irreversible hydrocolloid material, while the functional impressions were taken using custom trays and thermoplastic material for border molding and polyvinyl siloxane impression material. Maxillo-mandibular relations were determined using temporary bases with wax rims. The final trial with artificial teeth arranged according to a balanced occlusion was conducted to verify horizontal and vertical relations, phonetics and esthetics. The maxillar and mandibular prosthesis were produced in the heat cure acrylic resin. Disrupted functions of the oro-facial system such as mastication, swallowing and phonetics are improved significantly with complete dentures. Conclusion: Correct maxillo - mandibular relations and normal function of the dentofacial system in patients with ED, can be achieved by the acrylic dentures. Prosthodontic treatment has a major impact not only on the functions and esthetics, but on the psychological development and emotional state as well.

40|$|Several {{nutritional}} {{studies have}} found that excess or reduced dietary vitamin A (VA) causes skeletal malformations in marine fish larvae. Feeding VA enriched rotifers to striped trumpeter (Latris lineata) from 6 to 18 days post hatch (dph) has been shown to affect vertebral column malformations but not jaw malformation. Our study examined the effect of dietary VA during the later Artemia feeding period on the prevalence of malformations. Larvae were initially reared in a 3000 l tank and fed a diet of Algamac- 3050 enriched rotifers from 2 to 16 dph. At 16 dph, larvae were transferred to 24 × 300 l tanks and fed Artemia enriched with one of six doses of retinyl palmitate (VA) four times per day from 19 to 44 dph. Enrichment with emulsions containing 0 (control), 795, 1, 558, 3, 174, 4, 911 and 10, 518 ng retinyl palmitate mg- 1 emulsion resulted in an average VA in Artemia of 0, 6, 7, 27, 30 and 55 ng retinyl palmitate mg- 1 dry weight (DW). The retinoid content of L. lineata at 44 dph was positively correlated with the enriched Artemia they fed on. Growth in length (15. 91 ± 0. 31 mm, mean ± SD) and dry weight (5. 08 ± 0. 32 mg), and survival (26. 1 ± 2. 9 %), were not significantly affected at 44 dph by increasing dietary doses of retinyl palmitate. Retinyl palmitate enrichment in Artemia did not affect jaw malformation in L. lineata, which is contrary to other studies on a range of marine fish species treated with increased doses of dietary VA. By the end of the study, 54 ± 10 % and 18 ± 6 % of the post larvae across treatments had short lower and open <b>jaws,</b> respectively. <b>Severe</b> <b>jaw</b> malformations affected 50 ± 11 % of the post larvae. Early culture of larvae in a larger tank was likely to reduce overall prevalence of jaw malformations compared to previous studies as interaction with tank walls was reduced. The prevalence of vertebral column malformations in 44 dph post larvae (58 ± 4 %) were also not affected by dietary VA.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 190 million bisphosphonates have been prescribed worldwide. But this drug can produce adverse effects, of which osteonecrosis of the <b>jaw</b> and <b>severe</b> hypocalcemia are the most serious. It is evident that bisphosphonate administration affects multiple and diverse biochemical mediators related to bone metabolism. This review of literature investigates four basic parameters in patients treated with bisphosphonates - parathyroid hormone (PTH), bisphosphonates, vitamin D, calcium, and jaw osteonecrosis - which are fundamental for assessing bone metabolism and so the efficacy and correct use of the drug. The imbalances generated by vitamin D and calcium deficiencies, together with their multiple systemic repercussions, have been widely researched but the outcomes of these imbalances in relation to bisphosphonate administration are not well known, and some {{research has indicated that}} they may be associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The present review set out to explain the functioning of bone metabolism, the importance of different chemical mediators, the imbalances produced by incorrect use of this drug, in order to forewarn against the possible relation of these parameters with ONJ, whose physiopathology remains unknown. Medical and dental clinics should keep detailed anamneses of the use of vitamin D and calcium supplements, as it is of vital importance to maintain their correct levels in blood, given that these are related to ONJ as well as other adverse effects; this procedure is also necessary in order to ensure the correct use of the drug...|$|R

Objectives: To investigate the immediate effect of the Twin block (TB) functional appliance on the airway in patients with class II division 1 malocclusion on skeletal II base and to measure the immediate changes in the position of the hyoid bone after insertion of the TB appliance. Materials and Methods: Two lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken and analyzed one before and one after insertion of the TB appliance for the 19 patients. The age range 10 - 14 years. Immediate change in the airway was performed by measuring the changes in the vertical position of the hyoid bone relative to the mandibular plane (H 1) and to the (cv 3 -RGN) plane (H 2). The change in the airway can be measured by the change in the vertical position of the hyoid bone before and after insertion of TB appliance (H-H 1) + (H-H 2).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review was to describe the prevalence of whiplash trauma in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and to describe clinical signs and symptoms in comorbid TMD/whiplash compared with TMD localised to the facial region. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane Library and Bandolier databases was carried out for articles published from 1 January 1966 to 31 December 2012. The systematic search identified 129 articles. After the initial screening of abstracts, 32 articles were reviewed in full text applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six studies on the prevalence of neck trauma in patients with TMD met the inclusion criteria and {{were included in the}} review. Two of the authors evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. The reported prevalence of whiplash trauma ranged from 8 · 4 % to 70 % (median 35 %) in TMD populations, compared with 1 · 7 - 13 % in the non-TMD control groups. Compared with patients with TMD localised to the facial region, TMD patients with a history of whiplash trauma reported more TMD symptoms, such as limited jaw opening and more TMD pain, and also more headaches and stress symptoms. In conclusion, the prevalence of whiplash trauma is higher in patients with TMD compared with non-TMD controls.

In 2002 / 2003 a number of patients presented to the South Australian Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit with unusual non-healing extraction wounds of the jaws. All were middle-aged to elderly, medically compromised and on bisphosphonates for bone pathology. Review of the literature showed similar cases being reported in the North American oral and maxillofacial surgery literature. This paper reviews the role of bisphosphonates {{in the management of}} bone disease. There were 2. 3 million prescriptions for bisphosphonates in Australia in 2003. This group of drugs is very useful in controlling bone pain and preventing pathologic fractures. However, in a small number of patients on bisphosphonates, intractable, painful, non-healing exposed bone occurs following dental extractions or denture irritation. Affected patients are usually, but not always, over 55 years, medically compromised and on the potent nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, pamidronate (Aredia/Pamisol), alendronate (Fosamax) and zolendronate (Zometa) for nonosteoporotic bone disease. Currently, there is no simple, effective treatment and the painful exposed bone may persist for years. The main complications are marked weight loss from difficulty in eating and <b>severe</b> <b>jaw</b> and neck infections. Possible preventive and therapeutic strategies are presented although at this time {{there is no evidence of}} their effectiveness. Dentists must ask about bisphosphonate usage for bone disease when recording medical histories and take appropriate actions to avoid the development of this debilitating condition in their patients...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. A {{possible}} case of montelukast-induced angioedema is reported. Summary. A 46 -year-old {{woman with a}} history of severe allergies, including food allergies, and angioedema was evaluated at the emergency department (ED) for an acute episode of angioedema. Upon arrival at the ED, the patient had <b>severe</b> <b>jaw</b> tightness, facial numbness, uncontrollable cheek lifting, swollen eyes, and a swollen protruding tongue and was unable to catch her breath. Her dyspnea was apparent, and she was unable to talk and instead used hand and face gestures for affirmative and negative responses. The patient was treated with 0. 3 mg epinephrine intramuscularly into the right thigh. After treatment, she had a temperature of 37 °C, a pulse of 90 beats/ min, a blood pressure value of 100 / 59 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and 100 % oxygen saturation on room air. After stabilization, she reported that her allergies had been adequately controlled with ebastine 10 mg daily, montelukast 10 mg daily, and vitamins (unspecified). The patient reported that since she started montelukast one month prior, she experienced three similar episodes, the first occurring five days after starting the drug. She mentioned being diagnosed and adequately treated these three times in the ED for angioedema. The patient denied any changes in eating habits or in her medications except for starting montelukast. She was observed at the ED for an hour and then discharged after stabilization on hydroxyzine hydrochloride 25 mg orally daily and fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg orally daily. Montelukast was discontinued. Conclusion. A patient developed angioedema four times during one month of treatment with montelukast. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Several {{nutritional}} {{studies have}} linked dietary vitamin A (VA) to skeletogenesis in marine fish larvae. In our study, rotifers were enriched with eight levels of retinyl palmitate. Striped trumpeter (Latris lineata) larvae were fed rotifers twice daily, VA-enriched rotifers (morning feed) and Algamac − 3050 enriched rotifers (afternoon feed), in greenwater systems from 6 to 18 days post-hatch (dph). The VA-enriched rotifers had incorporated 0, 6, 14, 26, 57, 109, 215 and 388 ng retinyl palmitate mg− 1 dry weight (DW) following 2 h enrichment with emulsions containing 0 (control), 68, 187, 532, 1402, 2670, 4808 and 9523 ng retinyl palmitate mg− 1 emulsion. After the rotifer feeding phase (6 to 18 dph), the larvae were fed Algamac − 3050 enriched Artemia until 43 dph. The pattern of increasing VA in the enriched rotifers was not {{reflected in the}} larvae. Larvae incorporated 11. 08 ± 0. 27 ng total retinol mg− 1 DW (mean ± SD) when fed rotifers containing 0. 93 to 2. 32 ng total retinol mg− 1 DW (6 to 14 ng retinyl palmitate mg− 1 DW) and incorporated {{a lower level of}} 5. 57 ± 0. 30 ng total retinol mg− 1 DW when fed rotifers with 0. 52 (control) or ≥ 16. 31 ng total retinol mg− 1 DW (0 and ≥ 57 ng retinyl palmitate mg− 1 DW). By 43 dph, neither larval growth in length (16. 0 ± 0. 1 mm) or dry weight (4. 57 ± 0. 20 mg), nor survival (34. 8 ± 10. 6 %), were significantly affected by increasing dietary levels of retinyl palmitate. The prevalence of vertebral column malformations in 43 dph post larvae was positively correlated with total retinol content of larvae at 16 dph (R 2 = 0. 55, P less than 0. 001). Unlike other studies on a range of marine fish species, retinyl palmitate enrichment in rotifers did not affect the type or severity of jaw malformations. By 43 dph, 81 ± 9 % of post larvae displayed <b>severe</b> <b>jaw</b> malformations. Vitamin A daily inclusion of more than 123 ng total VA mg− 1 DW rotifer, equivalent to more than 35 ng total retinol mg− 1 DW rotifer (109 ng retinyl palmitate mg− 1 DW rotifers), is recommended to reduce vertebral column malformations when L. lineata larvae are reared in greenwater...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{augmentation}} may {{be required}} in situations of <b>severe</b> <b>jaw</b> bone resorption {{to be able to}} use oral implants for reconstruction of the edentulous patient. The use of barrier membranes, bone grafts or a combination of the two have been suggested for this pupose. However, little is known to what extent augmented bone contributes to implant stability. The aims of the research undertaken have been to investigate the integration of titanium implants in membrane-induced and grafted autogenous bone with special emphasis on implant stability. Two animal models were developed, one for the study of membrane induced bone augmentation at exposed threads of implants and one for the study of implant integration in bone grafts. Histomorphometry, resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and removal torque measurements (RT) were mainly used as evaluation techniques. Titanium microimplants were used in patients to obtain histology of the bone graft/titanium interface at different healing intervals. The outcome of a particular grafting technique and delayed implant placement was evaluated in one prospective and in one cross-sectional clinical study using RFA. Membrane-induced bone augmentation at titanium implants and beyond the skeletal envelope was predictably achieved. However, this bone did not significantly contribute to the implant stability. Simultaneous placement of titanium implants in onlay bone grafts resulted in significantly higher stabilty, compared to implants placed without a bone graft. The use of a barrier membrane prevented graft resorption as long the membrane was in place but did not improve implant stability. Delayed implant placement after primary healing of onlay bone grafts resulted in a significantly higher stability and a higher degree of bone-implant contact when compared to simultaneously placed bone grafts and implants. Clinically retrieved microimplants placed in a delayed approach showed a significantly higher bone-implant contact and amount of bone within implants threads as compared to simultaneously placed microimplants, irrespective of 6 or 12 months healing. The use of a Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafts and delayed implant placement, showed acceptable long term results. The implant stability in these cases, evaluated with resonance frequency, showed an increase with time. In conlusion and with obvious limitation to the tested experimental conditions a) membrane-induced bone did not contribute to implant stability in the model studied; b) delayed placement of titanium implants is preferable when using autogenous bone grafts and implants; c) implant stability increases with time after a Le Fort I osteotomy with interpositional bone grafts and delayed implant placement...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityMoose (Alces alces gigas) {{were introduced to the}} copper River Delta with a series of translocations of 23 calves from 1949 - 58. The population grew rapidly and a hunting season was initiated in 1960. The great earthquake of 1964 uplifted the delta resulting in changes which, presumably, increased the amount of high quality habitat for moose. The population continued to grow and expand their range to the southeast. The severe winter of 1971 - 72 resulted in the loss of about 15 - 20 % of the moose population on the west Copper River Delta and since that time, the west and east Delta herds have been maintained at about 250 animals each through a combination of registration and/or limited permit hunts. The ecology of moose on the west Copper River Delta was intensively studied from March 1987 -July 1989. Mean home range size was not different among seasons (winter, summer), sex, or areas (west and east deltas). Mean (SE) home range size was 58. 8 (4. 8) km². About 50 % of collared females were seasonally migratory with distinct winter and summer home ranges. Only 20 % of collared males were migratory. Snow depths influenced moose movements and distribution and varied among years, areas, and habitat types. Calf production averaged > 1 calf/female, but survival was low with an average recruitment rate of 30 calves/ 100 females. Calf mortality was associated with inclement spring weather and predation by brown bears (Ursus arctos). Most adult mortality was due to legal harvest with accidents and starvation (due to <b>severe</b> <b>jaw</b> necrosis) accounting for the rest of adult moose mortality. Antler characteristics of Copper River Delta moose suggested a founder effect of the translocation, and/or a genetic "bottleneck" created when approximately 83 % and 63 % of breeding males were harvested in 1960 and 1962, respectively. The retention of pedicle bone on some cast antlers suggested a mineral imbalance in the diet associated with foraging in an aquatic habitat. Telemetry studies indicated that 5 habitat types (plant communities) were most important to moose and that use of those habitats varied among years, seasons, and sex. Open tall alder-willow (Alnus sinuata-Salix spp [...] ), closed tall alder-willow, and low sweetgale-willow (Myrica gale-Salix spp.) habitat types were used the most; woodland spruce (Picea sitchensis) and aquatic (wet forb herbaceous) types were used relatively less. Aquatic and sweetgale-willow habitat types were used primarily for feeding. Closed tall alder-willow and woodland spruce habitats were used primarily for bedding, with open tall alder-willow stands used equally for both activities. Moose calved primarily in closed tall alder-willow and upland low sweetgale-willow habitats with low soil moisture and a closed canopy. Habitat selection by moose was examined at 2 levels. Moose selected areas (home ranges) that contained proportionately more aquatic and low sweetgale-willow habitats than were available on the west Copper River Delta. However, within their home range, moose selected for the open tall alder-willow habitat and used aquatic and low sweetgale-willow habitats significantly less (P < 0. 0001) than their availability. An ordination of the 5 habitat types emphasized the importance of moisture regimes and stand age in habitat characteristics. The positioning of woodland spruce stands along the ordination axes was related to their understory composition suggesting that this habitat type was an extension of either low sweetgale-willow or closed tall alder-willow habitat types. Moose food habits were determined by fecal and rumen analyses. Cluster analysis of data from monthly fecal collections resulted in 3 groups representing winter, spring/early-summer, and late-summer/fall diets. Willows (S. barclayi, S. sitchensis) were the primary forage of moose year-round. The addition of sweetgale and alder during winter was significant. spring/early-summer diets included aquatic herbs, while late-summer/fall diets were mostly willow leaves. Digestible protein, digestible dry matter, and ash content were greatest for aquatic herbs, followed by the leaves and current annual growth twigs of browse, then older twigs. The bark of browse was low in digestible protein, but significantly greater in digestible dry matter and ash than browse leaves and twigs. Forage quality was greater in spring and summer than fall and winter. Emergent aquatic herbs had elevated levels of a number of minerals including iron, magnesium, sodium, phosphorous, and fluoride (FI). The bark of browse had the greatest concentrations of calcium and Fl. Current annual growth. twigs of some browse species had the greatest manganese and copper levels. Forage standing crop and production (kg/ha) varied by species and habitat type with use estimates generally below 15 % of available mass. Alder was the most productive species, but lightly used by moose. Available mass and production of willows was similar among areas and habitat types on the west Copper River Delta. Excluding the aquatic habitat, alder-willow stands were the most productive and had the greatest available browse mass. Aquatic habitats were 3. 5 x more productive than terrestrial habitats with peak use occurring from May-August. Results {{of this study suggest that}} managers should consider expanding the closure of the moose winter range to off-road vehicles to an area north of the Copper River highway. However, the assumptions underlying this policy need further consideration. Managers should also consider expanding the boundary of Management unit 6 C to include areas currently in 6 B that are used during the fall by moose that winter in 6 C. The moose population on the west Copper River Delta was below habitat carrying capacity, based on food availability, and could probably be increased. Habitat selection patterns observed in this study were not confounded by density and reflected actual preferences. Increased moose density on the west Copper River Delta could change habitat selection patterns, but habitat types identified as preferred in this study would remain so, and habitat manipulation programs based on the results of this study will remain appropriate at higher densities...|$|R
