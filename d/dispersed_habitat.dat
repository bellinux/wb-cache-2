40|$|This paper {{examines}} socio-economic {{and environmental}} implications of targeting strategies adopted {{in one of}} the UK's Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) : Cambrian Mountains ESA, northern part. Larger farms with larger remnant habitats have benefited disproportionately from scheme participation and payments. This has created a two-tier system of farmers inside and outside the scheme within the designated ESA. Smaller wildlife habitats on farms at the margins of the ESA have been neglected by this selective targeting, which has placed greater emphasis on the conservation of large contiguous habitats in the centre of the area. Farmers of marginal ESA eligibility are disillusioned, as they are excluded both from ESA payments and potential participation in schemes outside the ESA area. Two alternative scenarios are suggested. First, ESA scheme prescriptions could be changed to allow farmers with only small or <b>dispersed</b> <b>habitats</b> to enter the scheme (e. g. very high payments for the first few hectares of a habitat entered). Second, the boundaries of the ESA could be redrawn to exclude the clusters of small non-participants.

40|$|Vicariance and {{dispersal}} can strongly influence population genetic {{structure and}} allopatric speciation, but their {{importance in the}} origin of marine biodiversity is unresolved. In transitional estuarine environments, habitat discreteness and dispersal barriers could enhance divergence and provide insight to evolutionary mechanisms underlying marine and freshwater biodiversity. We examined this by assessing phylogeographic structure in the widespread amphipod Gammarus tigrinus across 13 estuaries spanning its northwest Atlantic range from Quebec to Florida. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 phylogenies supported deep genetic structure consistent with Pliocene separation and cryptic northern and southern species. This break occurred across the Virginian-Carolinian coastal biogeographic zone, where an oceanographic discontinuity may restrict gene flow. Ten estuarine populations of the northern species occurred in four distinct clades, supportive of Pleistocene separation. Glaciation effects on genetic structure of estuarine populations are largely unknown, but analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a phylogeographic break among clades in formerly glaciated versus nonglaciated areas across Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This finding was concordant with patterns in other coastal species, {{though there was no}} significant relationship between latitude and genetic diversity. This supports Pleistocene vicariance events and divergence of clades in different northern glacial refugia. AMOVA results and private haplotypes in most populations support an allopatric distribution across estuaries. Clade mixture zones are consistent with historical colonization and human-mediated transfer. An isolation-by-distance model of divergence was detected after we excluded a suspected invasive haplotype in the St. Lawrence estuary. The occurrence of cryptic species and divergent population structure support limited dispersal, <b>dispersed</b> <b>habitat</b> distribution, and historical factors as important determinants of estuarine speciation and diversification. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

In the present study, the important problem of understanding which are the factors that limit or enhance their number has been addressed. A mink population (Mustela vison) inhabiting a coastal area of SW Scotland, was studied. The main purpose was to relate the spatial organisation of mink with spatial and temporal variations in the abundance and distribution of its prey, through the study of foraging strategies and habitat selection. Different scales of spatial organisation were considered. Foraging strategies (activity levels, habitat use, foraging behaviour) were found to vary over time and in areas with different habitat characteristics. The distribution and abundance of terrestrial prey {{was found to be}} important in determining such strategies, ultimately influencing mink densities. This observation supports the hypothesis of Clode and Macdonald (1995) on the influence of terrestrial prey on mink ability to <b>disperse.</b> <b>Habitat</b> selection of mink in the intertidal zone was studied here for the first time. Resident animals, which were foraging at low or mid tide, and within core areas were found to behave selectively, preferring areas with high prey abundance. In the intertidal zone, prey was most abundant in the lower shore, in areas without fresh water, and in areas with abundant and large rockpools. Mink showed preference for all these habitat characteristics. The nature of the substratum was also important in determining the abundance of prey out of rockpools. The results of this study are discussed in relation to limiting resources and competition with native carnivores. Finally a new home range estimator - the Density Circles method - was developed. This estimator is particularly suitable for describing home ranges presenting anomalous shapes, such as those found in mink...|$|R

In addition, 22 new cryptophyte and 4 new M. rubrum cultures were used to extract DNA and sequence rbcL and 18 S-ITS- 28 S genes, respectively, in order to provide a stronger phylogenetic context for our environmental sequences. Bloom samples were analyzed from coastal Brazil, Chile, two Northeastern locations in the United States, and the Pribilof Islands within the Bering Sea. Additionally, samples were also analyzed from the Baltic and Barents Seas and coastal California under non-bloom conditions. Most blooms were dominated by a single Mesodinium genotype, with coastal Brazil and Chile blooms composed of M. major and the Eastern USA blooms dominated by M. rubrum variant B. Sequences from all 4 blooms were dominated by T. amphioxeia-like cryptophytes. Non-bloom communities revealed more diverse assemblages of Mesodinium spp., including heterotrophic species and the mixotrophic M. chamaeleon. Similarly, cryptophyte diversity was also higher in non-bloom samples. Our results confirm that Mesodinium blooms may be caused by M. major, as well as multiple variants of M. rubrum, and further implicate T. amphioxeia as the key cryptophyte species linked to these phenomena in temperate and subtropical regions...|$|R

Additionally, female lizards <b>disperse</b> through <b>habitats</b> based on the {{frequency of}} color types that are already present in the population.

Asymmetries between periods of population growth and decline result in a reciprocating dispersal strategy where the direction of migration is reversed as populations wax and wane. Thus, for example, if net migration of individuals flows from high- to low-density habitats during periods of population growth, net migration will flow in the opposite direction during population decline. Stochastic simulations and analytical models of reciprocating dispersal demonstrate that fitness, carrying capacity, stochastic dynamics, and interference from dominants interact to determine whether dispersal is balanced between habitats, or whether one habitat or the other acts as a net donor of dispersing individuals. While the pattern of dispersal may vary, each is consistent with an underlying strategy of density-dependent habitat selection...|$|R

The trunks of nine tree species from eight plant families representing smooth, intermediate and rough bark textures were sampled using a knockdown insecticide spray. In total, 12 species or morphospecies of Mesostigmata (excluding Uropodina sensu stricto) were collected, most of which are undescribed. Comparison with collections from other habitats indicates that epicorticolous Mesostigmata are mainly represented by suspended soil dwellers (six species), secondarily by generalists (four species) and a bark specialist (one species). A typical ground-dwelling species was also found but was represented only by a single individual. In terms of abundance, 50. 5 % of individuals were suspended soil dwellers, 40. 7 % bark specialists, and 8. 3 % generalists. Host species and bark roughness had no significant effect on abundance or species richness. Furthermore, there was no clear effect on species composition.

Through its diet, this chipmunk ingests seeds, which are not broken down through the digestive process, and the seeds are then defecated and <b>dispersed</b> throughout its <b>habitat,</b> spreading variation and enhancing the range o f the seed-producing plant. Similarly, the Lodgepole Chipmunk also disperses ectomycorrhizal fungi. This kind of fungi is important to forests, allowing for trees to subsist by increasing their water and nutrient gains. By dispersing spores, seeds, and pollen, the Lodgepole Chipmunk {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of the forest and mountain ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|Parvulastra parvivipara has a {{very unusual}} life cycle for a starfish. The adults are self-fertilising hermaphrodites and the eggs are brooded within the gonads. There is no planktonic larval stage and the {{directly}} developing juveniles are cannibalistic, feeding on other embryos and juveniles while in the brood pouch. When mature enough, they are released into the water in batches of up to twenty where they continue their life, quite probably in the same rock pool as their parent. Most starfish <b>disperse</b> to new <b>habitats</b> during the planktonic larval stage but Parvulastra parvivipara is unable to do this. It is likely that it can {{move to a new}} pool only by chance when an individual is swept there by a wave. Because of the inability of this species to disperse in a typical starfish manner, it may experience some adverse circumstance in any particular pool, be exterminated there, and perhaps recolonize the pool later.|$|R
