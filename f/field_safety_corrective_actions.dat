S. Department of Energy, and the U. S. Department of Defense. The general purpose of the investigation is to ensure adequate data are collected to provide sufficient and reliable information to identify, evaluate, and select viable <b>corrective</b> <b>actions.</b> This <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Investigation Plan provides investigative details for CAU 511, whereas programmatic aspects of this project are discussed in the ''Project Management Plan'' (DOE/NV, 1994). General field and laboratory quality assurance and quality control issues are presented in the ''Industrial Sites Quality Assurance Project Plan'' (NNSA/NV, 2002). Health and safety aspects of the project are documented in the current version of the Environmental Engineering Services Contractor's Health and Safety Plan and will be supplemented with a site-specific <b>safety</b> basis document. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 511 is comprised of the following nine <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> sites in Nevada Test Site Areas 3, 4, 6, 7, 18, and 19 : (1) 03 - 08 - 02, Waste Dump (Piles & Debris); (2) 03 - 99 - 11, Waste Dump (Piles); (3) 03 - 99 - 12, Waste Dump (Piles & Debris); (4) 04 - 99 - 04, Contaminated Trench/Berm; (5) 06 - 16 - 01, Waste Dump (Piles & Debris); (6) 06 - 17 - 02, Scattered Ordnance/Automatic Weapons Range; (7) 07 - 08 - 01, Contaminated Mound; (8) 18 - 99 - 10, Ammunition Dump; and (9) 19 - 19 - 03, Waste Dump (Piles & Debris). <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Sites 18 - 99 - 10 and 19 - 19 - 03 were identified after a review of the '' 1992 RCRA Part B Permit Application for Waste Management Activities at the Nevada Test Site, Volume IV, Section L Potential Solid Waste Management Unit'' (DOE/NV, 1992). The remaining seven sites were first identified in the 1991 Reynolds Electrical & Engineering Co., Inc. document entitled, ''Nevada Test Site Inventory of Inactive and Abandoned Facilities and Waste Sites''. The seven-step data quality objectives (DQO) process was used to identify and define the type, quantity, and quality of data needed to complete the investigation phase of the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> process. The DQOs address the primary problem that sufficient information is not available to determine the appropriate <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> for the CASs. <b>Corrective</b> <b>action</b> closure alternatives (i. e., no further action, close in place, or clean closure) will be recommended for CAU 511 based on an evaluation of all the DQO required data.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this CADD/CAP is to present the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> {{alternatives}} (CAAs) evaluated for CAU 547, provide justification for selection of the recommended alternative, and describe the plan for implementing the selected alternative. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 547 consists of the following three <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> sites (CASs) : (1) CAS 02 - 37 - 02, Gas Sampling Assembly; (2) CAS 03 - 99 - 19, Gas Sampling Assembly; and(3) CAS 09 - 99 - 06, Gas Sampling Assembly. The gas sampling assemblies consist of inactive process piping, equipment, and instrumentation that were left in place after completion of underground safety experiments. The purpose of these safety experiments was to confirm that a nuclear explosion would not occur {{in the case of}} an accidental detonation of the high-explosive component of the device. The gas sampling assemblies allowed for the direct sampling of the gases and particulates produced by the <b>safety</b> experiments. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site 02 - 37 - 02 is located in Area 2 of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) and is associated with the Mullet safety experiment conducted in emplacement borehole U 2 ag on October 17, 1963. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site 03 - 99 - 19 is located in Area 3 of the NNSS and is associated with the Tejon safety experiment conducted in emplacement borehole U 3 cg on May 17, 1963. <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site 09 - 99 - 06 is located in Area 9 of the NNSS and is associated with the Player safety experiment conducted in emplacement borehole U 9 cc on August 27, 1964. The CAU 547 CASs were investigated in accordance with the data quality objectives (DQOs) developed by representatives of the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office. The DQO process was used to identify and define the type, amount, and quality of data needed to determine and implement appropriate <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> for CAU 547. Existing radiological survey data and historical knowledge of the CASs were sufficient to meet the DQOs and evaluate CAAs without additional investigation. As a result, further investigation of the CAU 547 CASs was not required. The following CAAs were identified for the gas sampling assemblies: (1) clean closure, (2) closure in place, (3) modified closure in place, (4) no further action (with administrative controls), and (5) no further action. Based on the CAAs evaluation, the recommended <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> for the three CASs in CAU 547 is closure in place. This <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> will involve construction of a soil cover on top of the gas sampling assembly components and establishment of use restrictions at each site. The closure in place alternative was selected as the best and most appropriate <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> for the CASs at CAU 547 based on the following factors: (1) Provides long-term protection of human health and the environment; (2) Minimizes short-term risk to site workers in implementing corrective action; (3) Is easily implemented using existing technology; (4) Complies with regulatory requirements; (5) Fulfills FFACO requirements for site closure; (6) Does not generate transuranic waste requiring offsite disposal; (7) Is consistent with anticipated future land use of the areas (i. e., testing and support activities); and (8) Is consistent with other NNSS site closures where contamination was left in place...|$|R

The CAU consists of a single <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site, 71 - 23 - 001 - 71 DT. The DTRSA was used during May 1963 to decontaminate vehicles, equipment, personnel and animals from the Double Tracks Test. Double Tracks was one of four storage-transportation tests. The Double Tracks test was conducted in Stonewall Flat, approximately 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of Goldfield, Nevada, on the Nellis Air Force Range. The Double Tracks Test used a single device containing plutonium and depleted uranium and was designed to investigate the characteristics of plutonium-bearing particulate material formed by the non-nuclear detonation of a nuclear weapon. All facilities associated with the DTRSA operation were removed. Based on available information, the areas of concern at the DTRSA consisted of a decon facility (vehicle decon pad and decon sump) in the southern half of the DTRSA, and a burial pit and former loading/unloading area located in the northern half of the DTRSA. Based on the results of the <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Investigation, radiological field screening detected elevated gamma and alpha readings on excavated plastic debris. Swipe surveys taken on the plastic debris detected removable alpha. No contaminants were detected above preliminary action levels in soil samples. The debris excavated during the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> investigation was not characterized. The clean-closure <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> consisted of excavation, disposal, verification sampling, backfilling, and regrading. Field activities began on May 1, 2000, and ended on May 10, 2000. Soil that was associated with the radiologically contaminated man-made debris was placed into B- 25 bins, moved to the designated waste management area where it was scanned, and hauled off-site for disposal. Verification soil samples were collected and analyzed to determine if clean closure had bene achieved. Clean borrow soil was hauled to the site and used to backfill the excavation. The excavation was then regraded to promote drainage and minimize ponding of surface water. Since the site is clean-closed, post-closure care is not required...|$|R

The threat of an inspection {{increases the likelihood of}} compliance, but only for sanitation inspections, not for HACCP. HACCP compliance does not improve compliance with sanitation standards. Key words: enforcement, food safety, HACCP, monitoring, regulation, regulatory compliance, seafood. Increased incidence of (sometimes fatal) food-borne illness due to bacterial contamination has made food safety a widespread concern. These concerns motivated a new regulatory to food safety based on the Hazard Anal-ysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) concept. HACCP involves identifying points where the production process compromises food safety, developing systems to moni-tor food <b>safety</b> and <b>corrective</b> <b>actions</b> that address food safety failures, and maintaining records of these activities.

40|$|Background: Innovations {{play the}} {{key role in}} the success of {{orthopaedic}} surgery. However, even minor modifications in the established concepts and proven designs may result in disasters. The endemic of modular femoral neck fracture (24 cases of about 4000 implanted) in fully modular total hip arthroplasty, popular in our country for the last 20 years, seems to challenge us with such an unfortunate consequences. The aim of this report was to analyze the extent and the causes of the problem {{on the one hand and}} to propose possible solutions on the other. Methods: Literature search for problems associated with Profemur Z (or earlier versions with the same taper-cone design) fully-modular femoral stem made of titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) was performed, and hip arthroplasty registries were searched to evaluate the failure rates of the mentioned design. Mechanisms of failure were studied to get in-depth understanding of this particular hip reconstruction device. Results: Since 2010 onwards, several case reports on catastrophic modular femoral neck fractures of Profemur Z were published. Te frst Slovenian case was described in 2012. The first two larger series with modular femoral neck fractures were published in 2016. Te Australian Joint Replacement Registry was the first to discover increased revision rates due to fractures of this hip reconstruction system. Public Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (JAZMP) received frst two reports regarding Profemur Z modular neck complication from abroad in 2010, the first Slovenian report was received in 2012, and altogether 7 reports from Slovenian hospitals were received until December 2016. Corrosion at the neck-taper interface, where two equal or diﬀerent materials are subject to constant wear in the presence of body ﬂuids, is assumed to be responsible for the unacceptable high failure rate. Conclusions: Manufacturers are responsible to produce and market only safe devices. However, orthopaedic surgeons should carefully monitor any adverse eﬀect of innovations. JAZMP took adequate measures only after having received an urgent <b>field</b> <b>safety</b> <b>corrective</b> notice from the manufacturer in 2015 indicating that all lots of long modular necks made from cobalt-chromium alloy should be withdrawn. Tis should be viewed in concordance with the fact that the regulatory agency of the Republic of Slovenia was not receiving vigilance reports accurately and was thus unaware of the extent of this complication. A national arthroplasty registry would probably warn orthopaedic community on this questionable innovation earlier. Regulatory bodies should therefore establish such a registry as soon as possible, for the benefit of our patients. </p...|$|R

The purpose of this <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Decision Document is to identify and provide a rationale for the selection of a recommended <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative for each <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Site. The scope of this Correction Action Decision Document consists of the following tasks: (1) Develop <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives. (2) Identify <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative screening criteria. (3) Develop <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives. (4) Perform detailed and comparative evaluations of the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives in relation to the <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives and screening criteria. (5) Recommend and justify a preferred <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternative for each CAS. From November 1997 through January 1998, a <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> investigation was performed as set forth in the <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Investigation Plan for <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit No. 427 : Area 3 Septic Waste System Numbers 2 and 6, Tonopah Test Range, Nevada (DOE/NV, 1997 b). Details can be found in Appendix A of this document. The results indicated that contamination is present in some portions of the CAU and not in others as described in Table ES- 1 and shown in Figure A. 2 - 2 of Appendix A. Based on the potential exposure pathways, the following <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> objectives have been identified for <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 427 : (1) Prevent or mitigate human exposure to subsurface soils containing TPH at concentrations greater than 100 milligrams per kilogram (NAC, 1996 b). (2) Close Sep tic Tank 33 - 5 in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code 459 (NAC, 1996 c). (3) Prevent adverse impacts to groundwater quality. Based on the review of existing data, future land use, and current operations at the Tonopah Test Range, the following alternatives were developed for consideration at the Area 3 Septic Waste Systems 2 and 6 : Alternative 1 - No Further Action; Alternative 2 - Closure of Septic Tank 33 - 5 and Administrative Controls; Alternative 3 - Closure of Septic Tank 33 - 5, Excavation, and Disposal The <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> alternatives were evaluated based on four general <b>corrective</b> <b>action</b> standards and five remedy selection decision factors. Based on the results of this evaluation, the preferred alternative for <b>Corrective</b> <b>Action</b> Unit 427 is Alternative 2, Closure of Septic Tank 33 - 5 and Administrative Controls.
