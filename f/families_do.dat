5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, <b>families</b> <b>do</b> not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of <b>families</b> <b>do</b> not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E
25|$|Migration {{is often}} used as an {{employment}} strategy. Although many individuals choose to migrate permanently to another country, others may migrate on a more temporary basis or do so seasonally. When <b>families</b> <b>do</b> not all migrate together, they must negotiate family relationships across national borders. Which family members migrate and which stay behind can be important determinants of how inequality may manifest itself in these transnational families. Among families from Latin American countries, it {{is often the case}} that men will travel abroad to work. This means that the women in these <b>families</b> <b>do</b> the bulk of the day-to-day caring for the family.|$|E

25|$|Of note is {{the fact}} that {{research}} findings from LGBTQ+ persons who have emigrated from Nepal and the Philippines indicate that, although most emigrants' <b>families</b> <b>do</b> not approve of their lifestyles, remittance payments (i.e. when the person who left the country sends money back to their family) are a proven aid to breaking down the controversies surrounding their gender and/or sexual-non-conformity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Families</b> <b>do</b> {{not always}} immigrate as one unit. Given the various legal and {{economical}} {{factors associated with}} transnational migration, certain family members may {{find it easier to}} immigrate to the United States than others. In other cases, individuals may immigrate to the United States as an employment strategy, with no intention of permanently relocating their family to the U.S. The distribution of family members across national borders can generate unique forms of inequality within the families of immigrants.|$|E

25|$|Financing and Subsidies Urban {{water and}} {{sanitation}} systems do not receive direct subsidies and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their {{water and sanitation}} bills. Rural water systems receive a partial investment subsidy that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al Agua Potable y Saneamiento. By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15m³ per month. The client pays {{the rest of the}} bill. Beyond 15m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor <b>families</b> <b>do</b> not have access to efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.|$|E

Within the family Bromeliaceae, pitcher morphology and carnivory evolved twice (Brocchinia and Catopsis).
