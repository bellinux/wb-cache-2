5|$|The Royal Navy {{also made}} {{preparations}} in late 1942 {{for the movement}} of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at Singapore and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near Aden, this was judged to be unacceptably risky, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret. Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one capital ship to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government. In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.|$|E

[...] "In one way, however, your nephew's acquitting himself creditably, considering {{that there are}} apparently three people anxious to exert a beneficent influence upon him.

25|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} there was little, if any, new {{investment}} in the sport, with the decline in interest being partially attributed to the complex scoring system, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was a manual process then. However, this all changed {{with the introduction of}} automated electronic scoring systems. The general public only had to enter their names into the computers and everything else was done automatically.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{original}} plans, the western terminus of Crossrail was planned to be Maidenhead. Various commentators advocated {{an extension of the}} route further west as far as Reading, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was seen as complementary to the Great Western Electrification project which was announced in July 2009. A Reading terminus was also recommended by Network Rail's 2011 Route Utilisation Strategy.|$|E

25|$|The {{theories}} surrounding equal temperament {{began to}} be put in wider practice, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the meantone system, common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{interaction}} between colonial and native sciences was seen {{during most of}} the colonial era. Western science came {{to be associated with the}} requirements of nation building rather than being viewed entirely as a colonial entity, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> continued to fuel necessities from agriculture to commerce. Scientists from India also appeared throughout Europe. By the time of India's independence colonial science had assumed importance within the westernized intelligentsia and establishment.|$|E
25|$|Rømer's {{explanation}} {{of the difference between}} predicted and observed timings of Io's eclipses was widely, but far from universally, accepted. Huygens was an early supporter, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> supported his ideas about refraction, and wrote to the French Controller-General of Finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert in Rømer's defence. However Cassini, Rømer's superior at the Royal Observatory, was an early and tenacious opponent of Rømer's ideas, and it seems that Picard, Rømer's mentor, shared many of Cassini's doubts.|$|E

5000|$|Cuckoo divided UK {{film critics}} sharply, {{with the film}} garnering a score of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph wrote [...] "After a debut as {{impressive}} as The Gigolos, writer-director Richard Bracewell concocts a dismayingly daft script for this shoestring psychological thriller". David Jenkins in Time Out commented that the film was [...] "not particularly exciting or original, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it's</b> never made quite clear {{what all the fuss}} is about". Andrew Lowry in Total Film called it [...] "well-intentioned but fairly undramatic".|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} <b>especially</b> {{interesting}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was published {{only six months}} after Poe's own great hoax, [...] "The Balloon-Hoax", which many believed to be true despite its elements of the odd.|$|R
25|$|In the {{relatively}} permissive environment of Western host societies, Tamil diaspora association have articulated Tamil grievances, something that many argued {{was not possible}} because of repression in Sri Lanka (see, e.g., Ilankai Tamil Sangam, n.d.). This activism stands {{in contrast to the}} marked lack of participation by Tamils in contemporary Sri Lankan civil society and the impossibility of gauging the views of northeastern Tamils during the conflict. Tamil diaspora activists claim to fill this gap, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is illegal to articulate a Tamil secessionist position in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|However, {{access and}} {{availability}} of health care continues to be somewhat limited in lesser developed provinces where the health indices are also lower as compared to national averages. The country is in an epidemiologic transition and faces double burden of the diseases. New emerging threats should also be considered. The demographic and epidemiological transition underway will {{have a significant effect}} on the pattern of morbidity and mortality in the near and distance future, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> affects the emergence of chronic non-communicable diseases and the health problems of an aging population.|$|E
25|$|The {{demographics}} of Quebec constitutes {{a complex and}} sensitive issue, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> relates to the National Question of Canada. Quebec is the only province in Canada to feature a francophone (French-speaking) majority, and where anglophones (English-speakers) constitute an officially recognized minority group. According to the 2011 census, French is the First Official language spoken of more than 85.5% of the population while this number rises to 88% for children under 15 years old. According to the 2011 census, 95% of Quebec is francophone, with less than 5% of the population not able to speak French.|$|E

25|$|Answering {{the charge}} that Catholics were widely {{supporting}} the abolitionist movement, Bishop England noted that Gregory XVI was condemning only the slave trade and not slavery itself, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> existed in the United States. To prove his opinion, England had In supremo translated and published in his diocesan newspaper, The United States Catholic Miscellany, and {{even went so far}} as to write a series of 18 extensive letters to John Forsyth, the Secretary of State under President Martin Van Buren, to explain how he and most of the other American bishops interpreted In supremo apostolatus.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina’s first {{effort at}} nullification {{occurred}} in 1822. Its planters believed that free black sailors had assisted Denmark Vesey in his planned slave rebellion. South Carolina passed a Negro Seamen Act, which required that all black foreign seamen be imprisoned while their ships were docked in Charleston. The UK strongly objected, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was recruiting more Africans as sailors. What was worse, if the captains {{did not pay}} the fees {{to cover the cost}} of jailing, South Carolina would sell the sailors into slavery. Other southern states also passed laws against free black sailors.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{processes}} {{have been}} shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) and memories better consolidated by nocturnal sleep and even daytime naps. Certain sleep stages have been demonstrated as improving an individual's memory, though this is task-specific. Generally, declarative memories are believed to be enhanced by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative memories are enhanced by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. The effect of sleep on memory, <b>especially</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> pertains to the human brain, is an active field of research in neurology, psychology, and related disciplines.|$|E
