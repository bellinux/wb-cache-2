5|$|The main {{agricultural}} {{staple foods}} during the Han dynasty were foxtail millet, proso millet, rice (including <b>glutinous</b> <b>rice),</b> wheat, beans, and barley. Other food items included sorghum, taro, mallow, mustard plant, jujube, pear, plum (including Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), peach, apricot, and myrica.

Es durian (durian ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. Pulut Durian or ketan durian is <b>glutinous</b> <b>rice</b> steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. Red-fleshed durian is traditionally added to sayur, an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish. Ikan brengkes tempoyak is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in Sumatra. Dried durian flesh can be made into kripik durian (durian chips).|$|E

40|$|AbstractImport of rice as {{staple food}} is {{increasing}} every year following {{the increase of}} Indonesian population. Therefore, staple food diversification as rice substitute is needed by promoting <b>glutinous</b> corn <b>rice.</b> <b>Glutinous</b> corn <b>rice</b> is consumable for human and can be made only from local waxy corn. The {{problem is that the}} production rate of waxy corn is still low that the availability of main ingredient of <b>glutinous</b> corn <b>rice</b> is limited. Therefore, the production of waxy corn should be increased while efficient application of fertilizer is maintained. The objectives of this research were to increase the production of waxy corn, make the usage of phosphate fertilizer more efficient and produce main ingredient of <b>glutinous</b> corn <b>rice.</b> The expected specific target was to make a recommendation about how to increase the production of waxy corn and produce main ingredient of <b>glutinous</b> corn <b>rice.</b> This study was performed using randomized two-factor factorial design. The first factor was phosphate solvent extraction (E) consist of without extraction (control, E 0) and with extraction (10 L. ha- 1, E 1) while the second factor was SP- 36 (P) fertilizer, consist of without SP- 36 (control, P 0), 50 kg SP- 36. ha- 1 (P 1), 100 kg SP- 36. ha- 1 (P 2), and 150 kg SP- 36. ha- 1 (P 3). The results showed that the application of phosphate solvent extraction 10 L. ha- 1 increased the length and diameter of cob and the combination of phosphate solvent extraction 10 L. ha- 1 and 50 kg SP- 36. ha- 1 increased the production of dried seed per hectare. Moreover, application of phosphate solvent extraction decreased the usage of phosphate fertilizer...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} rehydration temperatures (30, 40, and 50 °C) and cooking times (2. 7, 4. 7, 6. 7, 8. 7, and 10. 7 min) at 95 °C on the pasting properties of three glutinous varieties (Thadokkham- 11, Thadokkham- 8, and Hom Mali Niaw) from Lao People’s Democratic Republic was investigated using rapid visco analyzer. Non-glutinous varieties (IR 64 and Doongara) were also analyzed to compare glutinous (amylose 15 %) varieties. All rice flours took up water at significantly (p < 0. 05) higher {{rates in the}} case of increased temperature and soaking time, resulting in a decrease in the onset temperature for pasting. Among the <b>glutinous</b> <b>rices,</b> Thadokkham- 8 showed a significant (p < 0. 05) decrease in peak viscosity in response to increased rehydration time and temperature. For this variety maximum viscosity (2403. 3 mPas) was observed at 1 min of rehydration at 30 °C and minimum viscosity (1852. 0 mPas) at 15 min of rehydration at 50 °C. The viscosity values of Thadokkham- 11 and Hom Mali Niaw varieties increased to their highest values (1608. 7 and 1477. 7 mPa. s, respectively) with an increase in temperature to 40 °C for 1 min. In general, the <b>glutinous</b> <b>rices</b> produced weaker gel than non-glutinous rices. Extended holding at cooking temperature (95 °C) had a more significant (p < 0. 05) effect on the glutinous varieties Thadokkham- 8 and Thadokkham- 11 than on the non-glutinous varieties (IR 64 and Doongara) used in this study...|$|R
