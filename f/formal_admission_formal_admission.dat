50|$|PJ Schwikkard and SE van der Merwe {{consider}} such <b>admissions</b> to be <b>formal</b> <b>admissions,</b> {{and rely on}} AD authority.|$|R
50|$|Informal admissions, {{on the one}} hand, {{are usually}} made out of court, {{although}} they {{can be made in}} formal settings (even to a magistrate, for example); that, however, does not make them <b>formal.</b> <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions,</b> on the other hand, are usually made as part of the pleadings, or in the court itself.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{need for}} clarity: <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> should be worded and {{recorded}} carefully, to eliminate ambiguity. A <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> need not necessarily be in writing, but this is preferable, for the purposes of clarity.|$|R
50|$|A {{plea of guilty}} itself {{constitutes}} a type of <b>formal</b> <b>admission.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> need to {{be clear}} and unequivocal, because of their implications.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the state's case, {{the court}} should inform an undefended accused that a plea {{explanation}} is no substitute for evidence under oath. All warnings, explanations, etc., should be properly recorded. The effect of a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> is to relieve the state of the necessity of proving the fact or facts in question. Such <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> are only of facts unfavourable to the accused.|$|R
50|$|The {{court may}} in its {{discretion}} put any {{question to the}} accused to obtain clarity. The court shall ask accused whether any allegation not in issue may be recorded as an admission in terms of section 220 (which provides that <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> by the accused relieve the State {{of the burden of}} proving such facts). If the accused consents, this is recorded as a <b>formal</b> <b>admission.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{general rule}} is that parties must prove their case by evidence. <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{constitute}} an exception to this general rule.|$|R
50|$|The {{weight to}} be accorded to an {{informal}} <b>admission</b> {{depends on the}} circumstances. <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> cannot be withdrawn or contradicted without compliance with certain formalities.|$|R
50|$|Even after withdrawal, a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> {{may still}} {{be taken into account}} as an item of evidence; it may still {{constitute}} an informal admission, in other words.|$|R
50|$|Note, {{however, the}} effect of a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> by the accused: it does not bind the State to a meaning {{fundamentally}} at variance with the State’s case.|$|R
50|$|Section 220 has {{now been}} amended to cover admissions made by either side. Section 220 {{provides}} that <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> are “sufficient proof” of the facts they cover.|$|R
50|$|While {{students}} must apply {{to be admitted}} to John Bapst, no <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> test is administered to determine what students are accepted. Application is free of charge.|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal of a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> in {{criminal}} trial is possible, if the formalities have been complied with, but a withdrawn admission {{may still have}} some evidentiary value.|$|R
50|$|The School of Continuing Studies offers {{certificate}} programs, individual courses, workshops, and onsite custom {{programs offered}} as open enrollment, with no <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> or application required of participants.|$|R
50|$|Informal admissions {{constitute}} {{merely an}} item of evidence helping to prove the other party’s case, whereas a <b>formal</b> <b>admission,</b> once made, is conclusive proof of the fact admitted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{are in a}} way part of the {{proceedings}} in a case. Examples include a plea {{in a criminal case}}, a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> under section 220 of CPA in a criminal case ( [...] 220 Admissions :An accused or his or her legal adviser or the prosecutor may in criminal proceedings admit any fact placed in issue at such proceedings and any such admission shall be sufficient proof of such fact) and pleadings in a civil case. They can be used against a party, and they constitute conclusive proof of the facts they cover.|$|R
50|$|In {{criminal}} trials, {{either side}} (the defence or the prosecution) may now make <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{in favour of}} the other side. They are made under section 220 of the CPA.|$|R
50|$|It is {{improper}} for {{the court}} to cross-examine the accused during questioning. It is a rule of practice that the court informs the accused {{of the effect of}} <b>formal</b> <b>admissions.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} {{certified}} as an industrial school in 1881. It was a girls school until boys were first admitted in 1965, though <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> was first given in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|In S v Malebo, Hiemstra CJ {{held that}} [...] "sufficient proof" [...] meant {{conclusive}} proof. Therefore a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> under section 220 immediately became conclusive {{of the fact}} covered thereby.|$|R
50|$|Informal {{admission}}s in South African law {{are part}} of the South African law of evidence. Briefly, an admission is a statement made by a party, in civil or criminal proceedings, which is adverse to that party’s case. Informal admissions, which are usually made out of court, must be distinguished from <b>formal</b> <b>admissions,</b> made in the pleadings or in court. <b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> are binding on the maker, and are generally made {{in order to reduce the}} number of issues before the court; an informal admission is merely an item of evidence that can be contradicted or explained away.|$|R
50|$|Withdrawal of <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> is only {{possible}} {{in the event of}} compliance with formalities. The court will only allow withdrawal if satisfied that it was a bona fide mistake, and that there is no prejudice to opposing party.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} for <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> {{is that they}} save time and costs. The system encourages people to admit facts which are not in dispute, so that the trial is not derailed and unnecessarily delayed by extraneous and superfluous issues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Formal</b> <b>admissions</b> may be {{made during}} pleadings, or during the trial itself. Section 15 of the CPEA {{provides}} {{that it is not}} necessary for a party to prove a fact formally admitted; nor is it competent to disprove a fact so admitted.|$|R
50|$|Living in the dormitories {{and villages}} is {{considered}} a privilege that is granted to the students and faculties who comply with {{the rules and regulations}} of the University. <b>Formal</b> <b>admission</b> procedures is followed before admitting anyone to the dormitories and villages of the university.|$|R
50|$|Courts {{should be}} wary about {{accepting}} <b>formal</b> <b>admissions</b> from an unrepresented accused on points beyond the personal {{knowledge of the}} accused. This occurs all too often in practice. The accused’s presence {{at the scene of}} the crime is within his personal knowledge; the veracity of the blood tests is obviously not.|$|R
5000|$|The College of Extended Studies {{provides}} {{instruction for}} continuing education programs, including {{professional development and}} continuing professional development. The college also has an [...] "open university" [...] policy, which allows prospective students to take courses from the University's offerings on a space-available basis without going through the <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> process.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{new members}} Russia, Peru and Vietnam, were {{admitted}} under a ten-year integration initiative (a decision agreed in 1997 but not converted into <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> {{for the new}} members until 1998). [...] The most recent additions prior to this had been those of Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and Chile in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Inkolat {{is a term}} {{from the}} rights of the nobility. It was {{obtained}} by either birth or <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> into the societies of knights and landed gentry in the old Austrian and Czech lands. Only in Lusatia there was no Inkolat; admission into the community of the state nobility was there much easier.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, {{the rules}} for {{admission}} to the U.S. Service Academies changed to include a <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> process to ensure the appointees' success and excellence.Between the two World Wars, the U.S. was divided into nine corps areas, and each of these maintained its own West Point Preparatory School, all being supervised by the USMA staff.|$|R
2500|$|There were no <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> {{requirements}} or {{procedures to}} join the community at Fruitlands, {{and there was no}} official record-keeping of members. Many residents stayed only {{for a short period of}} time and most lists are based on the journals of Alcott's wife Abby May. Residents of the Fruitlands came to be called [...] "consecrated cranks" [...] and followed strict principles and virtues. They strongly believed in the ideas of simplicity, sincerity, and brotherly love.|$|R
50|$|The {{turmoil of}} the French {{revolution}} (1789-1799) {{put an end}} to <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> ceremonies to the medieval Order of Saint Lazarus though King Louis XVIII, previously grand master of the order admitted a number of knights while in exile. With the Bourbon Restoration, King Louis XVIII and his successor King Charles X both served as Protectors of the order which continued to be function under the management of a council of officers.|$|R

50|$|Born in Paris, Desmarets was {{introduced}} to Cardinal Richelieu, {{and became one of}} the band of writers who carried out the cardinal's literary ideas when he was about thirty years old. His inclination, however, was to writing novels, and the success of his romance L'Ariane in 1632 led to his <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> to a circle of writers that met at the house of Valentin Conrart. When this circle later developed into the Académie française, Desmarets became its first chancellor.|$|R
40|$|The {{education}} of students taking noncredit continuing education courses {{at a community}} college is as much part of the American educational system as the {{education of}} students matriculated in a degree program {{at a community college}}. Noncredit courses are the type of education {{that for the most part}} is accessible to all, does not require <b>formal</b> <b>admission</b> procedures, and has few prerequisites other than someone’s motivation and confidence that he or she can do the wor...|$|R
