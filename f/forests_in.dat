5|$|Japan {{has nine}} forest {{ecoregions}} which reflect {{the climate and}} geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor is a {{commonly}} occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from late spring to early winter, with most fruit bodies recorded between {{the months of}} January to March. In {{a study of the}} distribution of mushroom species in this area, it was found to occur only in mature or uncut forests.|$|E

25|$|Logging {{has also}} been an {{important}} part of the Upland South's economy. The region became the United States' primary source of timber after railroads allowed large scale industrial logging in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Today, the historic importance of the Upland South's forests can be seen in its many national forests, such as Cherokee National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> Tennessee, Nantahala National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> North Carolina, and Daniel Boone National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky, among many others. The Upland South's terrain and forests, as well as history and culture, occur in parts of states usually associated with the Midwest and Deep South. These areas are often associated with national forests, for example Mark Twain National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> southern Missouri, Shawnee National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> southern Illinois, Hoosier National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> southern Indiana, Wayne National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> southeast Ohio, William B. Bankhead National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> northern Alabama, Chattahoochee-Oconee National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> northern Georgia, Sumter National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> South Carolina, and Ouachita National <b>Forest</b> <b>in</b> Arkansas and Oklahoma.|$|R

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} inhabits areas with significant cover from grasses or heavy undergrowth, {{and close to}} water bodies. It generally keeps away from human-inhabited areas.

5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the summer and moving down into lowland <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E

5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer <b>forests.</b> <b>In</b> Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|At {{a bend in}} the highway, {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of <b>forests</b> <b>in</b> the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E
