40|$|The {{move toward}} {{lead-free}} electronics {{has become a}} rapidly emerging issue for concern and evaluation. The movement has been triggered by the European Union’s (EU) proposal for a Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and by the Japanese focus on environmental marketing. The candidate solder alloys that {{have been identified as}} substi-tutes require high soldering temperatures since these alloys have typical melting temperatures between 198 °C and 227 °C. Concern has been raised that the higher processing temperatures required for wave and reflow soldering with these alloys will cre-ate increased drop out due to printed wiring board (PWB) warpage and component failures, since most components are not qualified in terms of reliability for these higher processing tem-peratures. In this paper, we present evidence for an additional reliability concern for lead-free soldered electronic product. Conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation is a failure mode associated with boards, which either operate or are stored in a humid envi-ronment. This paper compares the number of CAF formed on boards reflowed at 201 °C vs. 241 °C after aging under 100 V bias at 85 °C/ 85 % RH for 28 days.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the effect of pad sizes on inter-metallic layer formation and thickness for Sn-Ag-Cu solder pastes reflowed on Cu-metallization. <b>For</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> this could prove to be very important, as a wide range of devices and components of varying joint may need to be assembled on a typical board. This means that the nature and thickness of the inter-metallic layer formed for each joint size will be different. In the study, solder joints of different pad sizes representing different devices were used for evaluating the effect of solder volume on inter-metallic compound formation. In our previous study of the effect of solder volume on IMC formation and growth, we found that increasing the solder volume does not significantly affect the growth on the IMC thickness. This result identified the need for further investigation looking at specific geometries used in real-life assembly (at flip-chip, CSP, BGA and conventional SMT levels). The current study aims to consolidate and extend on the previous research findings. Five different pad sizes were used to investigate and evaluate inter-metallic formation and growth at these pad geometries. The reflowed solder joints have been isothermally aged for 100, 200 and 300 hours at 1750 C. The inter-metallic layer thickness and microstructure were then analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis.

This method is used to predict possible influences of a certain material to the environment through different development stages of the material. In LCA, the product systems are evaluated on a functionally equivalent basis, which, in this case, was 1000 cubic centimeters of an alloy. Two of the LCA phases, life-cycle inventory (LCA) and life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA), are needed to calculate the environmental impacts.
