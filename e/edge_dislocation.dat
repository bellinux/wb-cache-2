50|$|Dislocations {{can slip}} in planes {{containing}} both the dislocation {{line and the}} Burgers vector. For a screw dislocation, the dislocation line and the Burgers vector are parallel, so the dislocation may slip in any plane containing the dislocation. For an <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation,</b> the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so {{there is only one}} plane in which the dislocation can slip. There is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion, fundamentally different from slip, that allows an <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation</b> to move out of its slip plane, known as dislocation climb. Dislocation climb allows an <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation</b> to move perpendicular to its slip plane. A creep mechanism involving only dislocation climb, also known as Harper-Dorn creep, can occur under certain conditions.|$|E

Consequently, in the grain boundary recrystallization in the bicrystals with the primary <b>edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> in the component crystal(s) parallel to the tilt boundaries of large tilt angles, the SIBM mechanism played an important role.

5000|$|Dislocations are linear defects, {{around which}} (the {{dislocation}} line) {{some of the}} atoms of the crystal lattice are misaligned.There are two basic types of dislocations, the <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation</b> and the screw dislocation.

5000|$|An <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation</b> is {{a defect}} where an extra {{half-plane}} of atoms is introduced {{midway through the}} crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied {{from one side of}} the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary. A simple schematic diagram of such atomic planes can be used to illustrate lattice defects such as dislocations. (Figure B represents the [...] "extra half-plane" [...] concept of an edge type dislocation). The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the Burgers vector which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an <b>edge</b> <b>dislocation,</b> the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction. (see also Jog (dislocations)) ...|$|E

We have developed a micro-plasticity experiment, in which we impose a controlled strain to an homeotropic smectic A sample and observe, under microscope, the associated motion of <b>edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> (a dynamical extension of the well-known experiment [1] at rest described in R. B. Meyer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 41, 1393 (1978)). We note that <b>edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> are strongly pinned by screw dislocations.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of dislocations in {{crystals}} that can induce slip - <b>edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> and screw <b>dislocations.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> have the direction of the burgers vector perpendicular to the dislocation line, while screw dislocations have the direction of the burgers vector parallel to the dislocation line. The type of dislocations generated largely depends on the direction of the applied stress, temperature and other factors. Screw dislocations can easily cross slip from one plane to another if the other slip plane contains the direction of the burgers vector.|$|R
40|$|Correlations between {{critical}} current density (j(sub c)) critical temperature (T(sub c)) and {{the density of}} <b>edge</b> <b>dislocations</b> and nonuniform strain have been observed in YBCO thin films deposited by pulsed laser ablation on (001) LaAlO 3 single crystals. Distinct maxima in j(sub c) {{as a function of}} the linewidths of the (00 l) Bragg reflections and {{as a function of the}} mosaic spread have been found in the epitaxial films. These maxima in j(sub c) indicate that the magnetic flux lines, in films of structural quality approachingthat of single crystals, are insufficiently pinned which results in a decreased {{critical current}} density.

50|$|One very {{important}} {{way to increase}} photographic sensitivity is to manipulate the electron traps in each crystal. A pure, defect-free crystal exhibits poor photographic sensitivity, since it lacks a shallow electron trap that facilitates {{the formation of a}} latent image. In such a case, many of the photoelectrons will recombine with the silver halide crystal and be wasted. Shallow electron traps are created by sulfur sensitization, introduction of a crystalline defect (<b>edge</b> <b>dislocation),</b> and incorporating a trace amount of non-silver salt as a dopant. The location, kind and number of shallow traps have a huge influence on the efficiency by which the photoelectrons create latent image centers, and consequently, on photographic sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{driving force}} for {{dislocation}} climb is {{the movement of}} vacancies through a crystal lattice.

This atom shift [...] "moves" [...] the vacancy {{in line with the}} half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation. The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb. Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms [...] "jumping" [...] into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.|$|E
