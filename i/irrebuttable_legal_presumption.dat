50|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> {{affecting}} appraisal {{conditions are}} rare, but the appraiser may encounter <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> {{in the course}} of an appraisal practice. For example, in some jurisdictions a public entity has standing to commence an action to condemn private property only if it is able to demonstrate that it could not reach a resolution with the property owner. Often, the courts make a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> that a resolution cannot be reached if the public entity make an offer in good faith and have that offer rejected. In this context, the public entity is usually able to demonstrate that it was bargaining in good faith if the offer made was based on an independent appraisal. This <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> is often the basis of why right of way acquisition procedures are set up the way they are. So an appraiser's entire practice {{may be the result of}} a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>legal</b> <b>{{presumption}}</b> (presumptio juris) is {{a presumption}} that is {{stated in the}} positive canon law (ab ipsa lege). Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> was divided into two kinds: juris tantum [...] "which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary", and {{juris et de jure}} or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based). This distinction between the subdivisions of <b>legal</b> <b>presumption,</b> the relative (juris simpliciter) and the absolute (juris et de jure) was not continued into the 1983 Code of Canon Law and was dropped.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the actual}} legal {{effect of a}} <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> is not the legal {{determination}} of a fact. Most presumptions are rebuttable. What a <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> does is relieve one party of having to prove a particular fact once a precedent fact is proven, but most presumptions are rebuttable. The presumption shifts {{the burden of proof}} from one party to the other.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the concept of presumptions, and in {{particular}} of <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions,</b> in the context of national tax systems (Italy and Belgium) and EU law. The purpose was to investigate the concept of <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> under a twofold comparative perspective. After having provided a general overview of the common core concept of presumption in the European context, an insight in the national approach to <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> was given by examining two different national experiences, namely the Italian and Belgian tax systems. At this stage, the Constitutional framework and some of the most interesting and relevant at EU level presumptive measures were explored, with a view to underlining possible divergences and common grounds. The concept of (national) <b>legal</b> <b>presumption</b> was then investigated in the context of EU law, with the attempt to systematize under a uniform perspective a matter which has been traditionally dealt with either from the merely national point of view or, at EU level, through a fragmented form. In this instance, the EU law relevant framework and the most significant EUCJ case-law, in particular in the field of customs duties, VAT, {{on the issue of the}} repayment of taxes levied in breach of EU law and in the area of direct taxation, were examined so as to construe the overall EU approach to national <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions.</b> This was done with the finality of determining if and to what extent a common analytical framework may be identified, from which were extracted certain criteria governing the compatibility of national <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> with EU law. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} make sense of the {{existence}} of such rules and presumptions and their potential with a view to contributing to debates on a more coordinated or structured enforcement of abuse regulation provisions on a global scale. With that purpose, it compares the setup and role of <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> of dominance/monopolisation and of abusive behaviour as benchmarks for antitrust enforcement in both EU and U. S. law. Section two of the paper identifies and distinguishes two different categories of legal techniques (short-cut rules and evidentiary presumptions) facilitating the enforcement of abuse regulation. General policy and case law evolutions allow to infer that both legal systems seemingly attest to a move away from short-cut rules in favour of evidentiary presumptions. In the U. S., the latter kind of presumptions are also even more limited in scope and scale. Section three will summarily address those evolutions in relation to both legal orders. Section four questions to what extent a reliance on different regulatory enforcement techniques in both legal orders could provide fertile ground for convergence amongst EU and U. S. abuse practices and whether the development of effectively converging <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions</b> actually offers a way forward for emerging and more established competition law jurisdictions across the globe. Focus will particularly be put on <b>legal</b> <b>presumptions,</b> as they have become seemingly more important in both legal orders over the past two decades. Peer reviewe...|$|R
