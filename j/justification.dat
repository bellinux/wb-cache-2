40|$|Abstract. Current {{ontology}} {{development tools}} offer debugging support by presenting <b>justifications</b> for entailments of OWL ontologies. While these minimal subsets {{have been shown}} to support debugging and understanding tasks, the occurrence of multiple <b>justifications</b> presents a significant cognitive challenge to users. In many cases even a single entailment may have many distinct <b>justifications,</b> and <b>justifications</b> for distinct entailments may be critically related. However, it is currently unknown how prevalent significant numbers of multiple <b>justifications</b> per entailment are in the field. To address this lack, we examine the <b>justifications</b> from an independently motivated corpus of actively used biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal. We find that the majority of ontologies contain multiple <b>justifications,</b> while also exhibiting structural features (such as patterns) which can be exploited in order to reduce user effort in the ontology engineering process. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} {{an approach to}} automated knowledge acquisition in which users specify desired system behavior by constructing <b>justifications</b> of examples. <b>Justifications</b> are explanations of why example behaviors are appropriate in given situations. I analyze the problem of acquiring <b>justifications,</b> showing how current knowledge acquisition techniques are best suited for asking what-questions while <b>justifications</b> are naturally viewed as answers to why-questions. I sketch a new approach for acquiring <b>justifications</b> that transforms why-questions into what-questions, borrowing the sources of power of existing techniques. In this approach, users construct <b>justifications</b> by selecting facts that specify what is relevant in a situation from a space of facts provided by the elicitation tool. <b>Justifications</b> are then used to create operational mappings from situations to intended outcomes. I show how the approach is applied to two different knowledge acquisition problems: the acquisition [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{a number of}} important issues regarding the use of <b>justifications</b> for self-indulgence. <b>Justifications</b> are the reasons or explanations that people give themselves in order to permit and rationalise behaving in ways that are inconsistent with their preferred standards (e. g., “Just this once won't hurt!”, “I've had a hard day, I deserve a treat!”, “I can make up for this some other time!”). The primary aim of the thesis was to investigate the impact of using <b>justifications</b> for self-indulgence on self-regulation by investigating four questions: (a) whether or not the use of <b>justifications</b> undermines people's intentions to reduce self-indulgence, (b) when people are most likely to use <b>justifications</b> to self-indulge, (c) whether or not the use of <b>justifications</b> has consequences for the emotions that people anticipate experiencing during and after self-indulgence, and (d) whether or not an intervention designed to prevent the use of <b>justifications</b> would promote effective self-regulation. Unhealthy eating was used throughout as a context for investigating these aims. The findings suggested that the use of <b>justifications</b> {{plays an important role in}} promoting self-indulgence. Specifically, Studies 1 and 2 showed that the use of <b>justifications</b> undermines strong (but not weak) intentions to reduce self-indulgence, such that those with strong intentions were more likely to use <b>justifications</b> and this relationship was associated with greater consumption of unhealthy foods. Study 2 also showed that the use of <b>justifications</b> is causally related to self-indulgence. Priming the use of <b>justifications</b> (in an ostensibly unrelated domain) led participants to indulge in a subsequent taste test (i. e., eat more M&M's relative to unprimed participants). Studies 3 and 4 showed that participants were most likely to use <b>justifications</b> when they experienced self-regulatory conflict. Specifically, Studies 3 and 4 showed that greater conflict (as measured by ratings of the attractiveness and forbiddeness of a temptation) was associated with greater use of <b>justifications</b> to obtain and consume unhealthy foods. Studies 5 and 6 showed that the use of <b>justifications</b> engenders a mixture of positive and negative anticipated emotions during indulgence, and contrary to peoples' expectations, leads to more anticipated negative emotions after indulgence. Finally, Study 7 showed that the tendency to use <b>justifications</b> can be overcome by using if-then plans called implementation intentions. Participants who formed implementation intentions designed to prevent the use of <b>justifications</b> were more successful in reducing self-indulgence (i. e., their consumption of unhealthy snacks foods) relative to participants without plans. The research described in this thesis has a number of theoretical and applied values. Specifically, the thesis extends existing research on the use of <b>justifications</b> and makes {{a number of important}} contributions to the literature on self-regulation; the thesis identifies the use of <b>justifications</b> as an additional explanation for why failures of self-regulation can occur even in those who are strongly committed to achieving important goals and provides an effective intervention for overcoming the impact of <b>justifications.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|When {{authorities}} make decisions, {{they are}} often expected to provide {{an explanation for the}} outcome. In contrast to excuses or apologies, <b>justifications</b> are a particular kind of account, whereby the decision-maker accepts both responsibility and asserts that that the outcome was normatively just. Quality <b>justifications</b> are essential to the perceived legitimacy of authorities within organizations, as well as fostering pro-organization behaviors. The present research: (a) investigates the degree to which <b>justifications</b> are (or are not) a distinct component of overall justice determinations, (b) investigates the effect of high (versus) low quality <b>justifications</b> on perceptions of the decision-maker, and (c) compares and empirically evaluates the conflicting positions of two major justice models - the value protection model and group engagement model - regarding whether the hypothesized effect of high-quality <b>justifications</b> occur under conditions of strong moral conviction. The study asked participants to evaluate aspects of moral and policy decisions supported by high and low quality <b>justifications.</b> Informational justice emerged as a construct distinct from interpersonal justice and procedural justice when evaluating decisions and the decision-maker. High quality <b>justifications</b> have a positive influence on perceived procedural, interpersonal and informational justice related to the decision. Moral conviction matters, but only under conditions of moral agreement. Even when decisions are inconsistent with a moral mandate, high quality <b>justifications</b> increase positive perceptions of justice. The group engagement model thus received more support from the data than the value protection model...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{explanation}} capability of expert systems is usually listed {{as one of}} the distinguishing characteristics of these systems, {{the explanation}} facilities of most existing systems are quite primitive. Computer generated explanations are typically produced from canned text or by direct translation of the knowledge structures. Explanations produced in this manner bear little resemblance to those produced by humans for similar tasks. The focus of our research in explanation is the production of <b>justifications</b> for decisions by expert planning systems. An analysis of <b>justifications</b> written by people for planning tasks has been taken as the starting point. The purpose of this analysis is two-fold. First, analysis of the information content of the <b>justifications</b> will provide a basis for deciding what knowledge must be represented if human-like <b>justifications</b> are to be produced. Second, an analysis of the textual organization of the <b>justifications</b> will be used {{in the development of a}} mechanism for selecting and organizing the knowledge to be included in a computer-produced explanation. This paper describes a preliminary analysis done of <b>justifications</b> written by people for a planning task. It is clear that these <b>justifications</b> differ significantly from those that would be produced by an expert system by tracing the firing of production rules. The results from the text analysis have been used to develop an augmented phrase structured grammar (APSG) describing the organization of the <b>justifications.</b> The grammar was designed to provide a computationally feasible method for determining textual organization that will allow the necessary information to be communicated in a cohesive manner...|$|R
