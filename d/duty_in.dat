Seven thousand, five hundred members of the unit returned to the United States, and the 184th Infantry Regiment was reassigned to the California Army National Guard, cutting the division to half its combat strength. To replace it, the 31st Infantry Regiment {{was assigned to the}} division. The 7th Infantry Division remained on occupation <b>duty</b> <b>in</b> Korea patrolling the 38th parallel until 1948, when it was reassigned to occupation <b>duty</b> <b>in</b> Japan, in charge of northern Honshū and all of Hokkaido.

By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E

As a result, Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade, made up from three battalions that had been on garrison <b>duty</b> <b>in</b> Malta and one from Egypt. All were regular units, with very few reservists, but having spent a long period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E
5|$|Wettin saw active <b>duty</b> <b>in</b> the I Squadron of the German fleet for the {{majority}} of her career.

For the remainder of the war, Wettin served as a training ship for navy cadets and as a depot ship. After the end of the war, the ship was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping in 1921. Her bell is currently on display at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
