25|$|The {{geophysical}} {{features of}} the plateau {{may have been the}} result of an early Miocene collision event between the Benham Rise and the eastern margin of Luzon, which may have also allowed the inception of the NW striking strand of the Philippine fault. These forces may have impacted the shape of the island of Luzon because of the basaltic sea floor resisting the subduction that may have also cause the bending of the Philippine Fault. The active basins in Central Luzon, which trace an asymmetrical V shape, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to observe recent tectonic evolution of the fault system.|$|E
500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the details were left unclear because Lime Pictures had {{decided to leave the}} outcome of the rape trial to viewers. Viewers have been given the chance to apply for the fictional jury, consisting of a cross section of society, including non-Hollyoaks viewers. They will be shown evidence from the case and then decide whether Gilly is guilty or innocent. Chief executive of Lime Pictures, Carolyn Reynolds stated: [...] "We wanted to open up the thorny issue of {{how hard it is to}} be a juror and whether the court room <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to resolve some of these questions about rape." [...] The storyline was developed with the [...] "St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre" [...] and other charities. DCI Ben Snuggs, leader of Don't Cross the Line campaign, explained: [...] "This storyline represents an issue that we see all too often, involving whether consent is clear on the part of both parties involved in sexual activity, and particularly when alcohol and drugs are involved." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stripped Mixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes {{two out of}} five stars, stating that he felt that [...] "the logic of what is left behind doesn't quite make sense", pointing out that [...] "I Want You Back" [...] and [...] "ABC" [...] have no drums and [...] "feel a little tipsy and top-heavy"; [...] "Ben" [...] and [...] "With a Child's Heart" [...] have echoes of strings in the background, {{making it hard to}} identify the songs as being [...] "stripped". He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements, [...] "having so much of the arrangement absent" [...] means that the music [...] "just sounds awkward and incomplete, as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs." [...] Erlewine's overall opinion on the album was [...] "if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael's vocals, The Stripped Mixes does its job, but just because his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> to appreciate his genius." ...|$|E

He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said [...] "Every poet would like, I fancy, {{to be able to}} think that he had some direct social utility [...] [...] [...] [...] He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>place</b> in which to do it." ...|$|E
