One of the first individuals to develop recombinant DNA technology was a biochemist at Stanford {{by the name of}} Paul Berg. In his experimental design in 1974, he cleaved (cut into fragments) the monkey virus SV40. He then cleaved the double helix of another virus; an antibacterial agent known as bacteriophage lambda. In the third step, he fastened DNA from the SV40 to DNA from the bacteriophage lambda. The final step involved placing the mutant genetic material into a laboratory strain of the E. coli bacterium. This last step, however, was not completed in the original experiment.|$|E

[...] This cleavage is done by RuvAB complex interacting with RuvC, which together form the RuvABC complex. [...] RuvC is an endonuclease that cuts the degenerate sequence 5'-(A/T)TT(G/C)-3'.

Notable changes come to this plan upon the transformation of Dalek Sec who is filled with new emotions. He believes that a return to their biological roots is necessary and even makes peace with the Daleks' nemesis the Doctor, and asks for his help in relocating the new Dalek species. However, Sec fails to realise the Dalek imperative for racial purity among his comrades, who turn on him and replace his genetic sample with their own so the Dalekised humans would wipe out humanity and transform Earth into New Skaro. Sec is killed and the Daleks' plans fall into ruin when their Dalek army is corrupted with Time Lord DNA. Daleks Thay and Jast are killed, leaving the new commander, Dalek Caan, the only survivor as he terminates the Dalek-Human army by remote, killing the newly born species.

Back on Earth, the remnants of the Justice League of America are battling with a monstrous alien giant. In the confusion, Dr. Adam Strange is knocked down into the alien base it came from. After recovering, he discovers a wall full of space-suits and tries to use one to aid the JLA. Unfortunately, his attempt to play hero gets him knocked miles away. While Animal Man gets Green Arrow a safe distance away, Stargirl uses her Cosmic Staff as a distraction while Martian Manhunter tries to connect with the alien telepathically. He determines that the alien is a failed experiment made of <b>hybrid</b> <b>DNA.</b> It was kept alive only so that it could serve the purpose of protecting the scientists who made it. The creature senses Martian Manhunter's presence and tries to expel him from its mind, running away with Martian Manhunter still trapped in its body. Stargirl chases after him. Alanna and her fellow escapees run afoul of some Khundian guards. As she hurries on, she is distracted by the sound of Adam Strange's voice. As he fights Lobo, Hawkman demands to know who hired the Czarnian this time. Green Arrow and Animal Man spot Adam Strange sitting atop a rock in a stream, hoping that they managed to stop the creature without him. When Adam learns that Stargirl went after it alone, he powers up his jet pack and prepares to lead the way. Having chased the creature half way across Canada, Stargirl realizes that just blasting it with her staff isn't doing much good. She flies into the creature and finds Martian Manhunter. Using the remnants of their psychic connection, Stargirl successfully free J'onn, but is unable to stop the creature from continuing on its path of destruction. Martian Manhunter explains that the creature cannot be reasoned with. So if she can give him a form he can punch, all will be well. After realizing Stargirl's staff can change the form of the monster, J'onn has her fire on the alien until it is turned into wood, and smashes it. Unfortunately, the creature begins reconstituting itself. Before they can do anything to stop, they find themselves transported unexpectedly to the Desert of Nagalis on the planet Rann. Alanna runs into Adam Strange's arms, but he grabs her arm and warns that he'll kill her if she tries to pull another stunt like her escape again. Alanna realizes quickly that he isn't Adam Strange at all. He is Lord Byth in disguise and he explains that he has been using all of the prisoners' DNA to create a baby that will one day grow up to be Ultra the Multi-Alien: Slayer of Worlds.|$|E
