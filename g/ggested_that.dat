These tasks were expected to be effective in reflecting learners ’ various experience on learning process and in keeping learners ’ highly-motivated learning. The developed test courses were generally evaluated as useful by subjects. However, it was also su <b>ggested</b> <b>that</b> inference activity was more effective in the case of presenting simple information than that of complicated one. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} laser-assisted vacuum arc {{deposition}} (laser-arc) {{was developed to}} produce effectively high-quality coatings, especially multilayer coatings with a reduced number of droplets. The efficiency of this method depends mainly on the ignition probability of the vacuum arc discharges. In the present paper the process of arc initiation by laser irradiation will be studied and the influencing factors such as power density of laser irradiation will be studied and the influencing factors such as power density of laser irradiation, target material, and electrode configuration will be discussed. It will be shown that a high ignition probability (p bigger than 50 %) on such coating materials as Ti, TiC, TiN and C may be guaranteed with a laser power density of about 10 high 8 W/qcm, which can be achieved with a low-cost Nd-YAG pulse laser. Measurements of the plasma current preceding the arc ignition and microscopical investigations of the erosion pattern caused by the laser irradiation su <b>ggested</b> <b>that</b> the process of plasma-sustained arc ignition (unipolar arcing) {{plays an important role}} during the buildup phase of the vacuum arc discharge...|$|E
40|$|Lunar {{meteorite}} Kalahari 009 is a fragmental basaltic breccia contain ing various very-low-Ti (VLT) mare basalt clasts {{embedded in}} a fine-g rained matrix of similar composition. This meteorite and lunar meteorite Kalahari 008, an anorthositic breccia, were suggested to be paired mainly due {{to the presence of}} similar fayalitic olivines in fragment s found in both meteorites. Thus, Kalahari 009 probably represents a VLT basalt that came from a locality near a mare-highland boundary r egion of the Moon, as compared to the typical VLT mare basalt samples collected at Mare Crisium during the Luna- 24 mission. The concordant Sm-Nd and Ar-Ar ages of such a VLT basalt (24170) suggest that the extrusion of VLT basalts at Mare Crisium occurred 3. 30 +/- 0. 05 Ga ag o. Previous age results for Kalahari 009 range from approximately 4. 2 Ga by its Lu-Hf isochron age to 1. 70 ? 0. 04 Ga of its Ar-Ar plateau ag e. However, recent in-situ U-Pb dating of phosphates in Kalahari 009 defined an old crystallization age of 4. 35 +/- 0. 15 Ga. The authors su <b>ggested</b> <b>that</b> Kalahari 009 represents a cryptomaria basalt.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{temporary}} real {{exchange rate fluctuations}} can have persistent (hysteretic) effects on trade. Specifically, when market-entry costs are sunk, sufficiently large exchange rate shocks alter domestic market structure and thereby induce hysteresis. This simple result has strong implications for exchange rate theory, t rade policy, and estimation of trade equations. Empirical evidence su <b>ggests</b> <b>that</b> the recent dollar overvaluation induced hysteresis in U. S. import prices. Namely, the aggregate pass-through equation (of exchange rates to import prices) shifted in the 1980 s. The shift's nature and timing is broadly consistent with the hysteresis hypothesis.

40|$|The {{ratios of}} amino acid {{to the total}} amino acids and those of {{nucleotides}} to the total nucleotides in genes or genomes are suitable indexes to compare whole gene or genome characteristics based on {{the large number of}} nucleotides rather than their sequences. As these ratios are strictly calculated from nucleotide sequences, the values are independent of experimental errors. In the present mini-review, the following themes are approached according to the ratios of amino acids and nucleotides to their total numbers in the genome: prebiotic evolution, the chronological precedence of protein and codon formations, genome evolution, Chargaff’s second pa- rity rule, and the origins of life. Amino acid formation might have initially occurred during pre- biotic evolution, the “amino acid world”, and amino acid polymerization might chronologically precede codon formation at the end of prebiotic evolution. All nucleotide alterations occurred synchronously over the genome during biolo- gical evolution. After establishing primitive lives, all nucleotide alterations have been governed by linear formulae in nuclear and organelle genomes consisting of the double-stranded DNA. When the four nucleotide contents against each individual nucleotide content in organelles are expressed by four linear regression lines representing the diagonal lines of a 0. 5 square – the “Diagonal Genome Universe”, evolution obeys Chargaff’s second parity rule. The fact that linear regression lines intersect at a single point su- <b>ggests</b> <b>that</b> all species originated from a single life source...|$|R
