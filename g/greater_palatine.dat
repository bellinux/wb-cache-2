25|$|Like the face, {{the human}} nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus {{supplied}} with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel {{supply to the}} nose is two-fold: (i) branches from the internal carotid artery, the branch of the anterior ethmoid artery, the branch of the posterior ethmoid artery, which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from the external carotid artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> artery, the superior labial artery, and the angular artery.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the lateral}} nasal wall is {{supplied}} with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) {{and by the}} anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind). The nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery, and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> artery. These three (3) vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation. The nasal veins are biologically significant, {{because they have no}} vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the sinus caverns, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose. Hence, because of such an abundant nasal blood supply, tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise post-operative healing.|$|E
50|$|The {{descending}} palatine artery branches off of the maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa and descends {{through the}} <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> canal along with the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> nerve (from the pterygopalatine ganglion). Once emerging from the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen, it changes names to the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> artery and begins to supply the hard palate. As it terminates it travels through the incisive canal to anastomose with the sphenopalatine artery to supply the nasal septum.|$|E

50|$|The Maxillary nerve gives {{cutaneous}} {{branches to}} the face. It also carries parasympathetic preganglionic fibers (sphenopalatine) and postganglionic fibers (zygomatic, <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>palatine</b> and nasopalatine) {{to and from}} the pterigopalatine ganglion.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> nerve (anterior palatine nerve) is {{a branch}} of the pterygopalatine {{ganglion}} that carries both general sensory fibres from the maxillary nerve and parasympathetic fibers from the nerve of the pterygoid canal. It descends through the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> canal, emerges upon the hard palate through the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen, and passes forward in a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth.|$|E
50|$|At either {{posterior}} {{angle of}} the hard palate is the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen, for the transmission of the descending palatine vessels and <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> nerve; and running anteriorly (forward) and medially (towards the center-line) from it is a groove, for the same vessels and nerve.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} hard palate asymmetry during development. the palates of 248 dry skulls were photographed and evaluated digitally. the skulls were divided into seven groups: fetus, newborn, infant, child, adolescent, adult, and aged. Linear measures were obtained from <b>great</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen (GPF) to incisive fossa (INC) and to posterior nasal spine (PNS). Angular measures were obtained from the former landmarks plus the point on sutures intersection between maxillary and palatine bones. Asymmetry was evaluated intra and intergroups. All skulls showed some degree of right-left asymmetry in the hard palate. Regardless of hard palate asymmetry, none of the right-left side differences was statistically significant. for the intergroups assessment, none of the asymmetry index means were statistically different. the posterior part of palate (PNS x GPF) measures was more asymmetric than the anterior part (INC x GPF), showing, respectively, 4. 6 % and 2. 8 % of mean asymmetry index. Angular measures showed a more symmetric behavior than the linear ones. Hard palate asymmetry occurs even in the absence of masticatory function, showing that this feature begins early in fetal life and persists through development.

2500|$|The pterygopalatine ganglia are ganglia (one on each side) of {{the soft}} palate. The <b>greater</b> petrosal, lesser <b>palatine</b> [...] and {{zygomatic}} nerves all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the nasal cavity; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the lacrimal nerve that activate the lacrimal gland; which {{is the reason that}} spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the zygomatic are maxillary nerves (from the trigeminal nerve).|$|R
40|$|Summary: Granular cell tumor (GCT) is an {{infrequent}} benign neoplasm, which Abrikosoff accurately {{described in}} 1926. GCT {{probably has a}} neural crest cell origin. We present the clinical and imaging findings in a 45 -year-old woman with a GCT involving the palate. CT and MR imaging revealed perineural tumor spread along the <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>palatine</b> nerves. We emphasize the peculiarity of the palatine location and the perineural spread of GCTs. Granular cell tumor (GCT) is an uncommon be-nign lesion affecting the mucous membranes of the upper aerodigestive tract. About one third of all GCTs occur {{in the head and}} neck region (1). The most common site is the anterior part of the tongue. Most GCTs are benign, but approximately 10 % have malignant behavior (2). Metastases to the regiona...|$|R

30|$|The {{radiologist}} with 15  years of post-training {{experience of}} {{head and neck}} imaging also reviewed all of the CT images {{for the presence of}} remaining sinus wall within the tumor, intratumoral necrosis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and tumor extension. Permeative-type tumors were always accompanied by considerable amount of remaining sinus walls within the tumor. Among destructive and expansile-type tumors, if a little bit of sinus wall were found within the tumor, we assessed the presence of remaining sinus wall within the tumor. Among the cases with remaining sinus wall within the tumor, predominant bony erosive patterns were classified into resorption or remodeling, and the presence of accompanying sclerosis was also assessed. We regarded focal hypodense areas on unenhanced CT images or focal unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced CT images as areas thought to be intratumoral necrosis. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes were considered as metastatic nodes when the minimum diameter exceeded 1.0  cm (van den Brekel et al. 1990). Cervical lymph nodes accompanied by focal hypodense areas on unenhanded CT image or focal unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced CT images were also considered as metastatic nodes. Perineural spread was defined as an invasion of the pterygopalatine fossa, followed by extension to the <b>greater</b> or lesser <b>palatine</b> foramen, Vidian canal, foramen rotundum, or cavernous sinus. We used the following diagnostic criteria for perineural spread: asymmetric enlargement or destruction of the neural foramen on CT images.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{important}} foramina in the palatine bones that transmit nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine). The larger <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen {{is located in}} the posterolateral region of each of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. The <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen transmits the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> nerve and blood vessels. A smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. Both foramina are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.|$|E
