5000|$|These {{processing}} steps {{will produce}} a brown or raw <b>sugar.</b> Mill <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> also known as plantation <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> can be produced by introducing some form of colour removal process (often sulphitation) between the juice clarification and the juice evaporation stages mentioned above. [...] The raw sugar produced is often refined to produce <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b> This sugar refining can be done either at a completely separate factory or at a back-end refinery which {{is attached to the}} raw sugar factory.|$|R
50|$|One hundred {{grams of}} brown sugar {{contains}} 377 Calories (nutrition table), {{as opposed to}} 387 Calories in <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> (link to nutrition table). However, brown sugar packs more densely than <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> due to the smaller crystal size and may have more calories when measured by volume.|$|R
50|$|Nib sugar (also {{pearl sugar}} and hail sugar) {{is a product}} of refined <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b> The sugar is very coarse, hard, opaque white, and does not melt at {{temperatures}} typically used for baking. The product usually is made by crushing blocks of <b>white</b> <b>sugar,</b> then sifting to obtain fragments of a given diameter. The sugar may also be made in an extrusion process.|$|R

50|$|The {{molasses}} usually {{used for}} food is obtained from sugar cane, because the flavor is generally preferred over beet sugar molasses, although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, {{sugar beet molasses}} is used. The <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, nutritional value, color, and taste of fully refined <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> will be masked by the molasses.|$|R
25|$|Blanco directo, a <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> {{common in}} India and other south Asian countries, is {{produced}} by precipitating many impurities out of cane juice using phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide, similar to the carbonatation technique used in beet sugar refining.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>sugar</b> is an {{important}} commodity Indonesia. Sugar’s price fluctuates due to its availability. The availability is depend on the season of sugar crop. Government has to control its price to fullfill national price. However, previous experience shows that scarcity of product availability and fluctuated of price due to unbalanced supply and demand quantity. This paper proposed a model to control price of <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> for case of one commodity and multi region. One time horizon is divided into four periods: (i) beginning of harvesting period, (ii) end of harvesting period, (iii) beginning of planting period, and (iv) end of planting period. There are two type of region considered (i) deficit region and (ii) surplus region. A price band is determined to define maximum and minimum price of <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b> The government has two policy options to control the price of <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> (i) price support program, and (ii) price stabilization program. This problem is modeled as mathematical programming problem with objective function is to maximize total benefit of producer, consumer, and government. Numerical example is provided to illustrate model mechanism for price of <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> in both region...|$|R

As with any cocktail, the proportion of ingredients and subtleties of technique will result in differing nuances of flavor.|$|R

It is commonly used in baking and cold mixed drinks because it dissolves faster than granulated <b>white</b> <b>sugar.</b> Caster sugar can be easily prepared at home by grinding <b>white</b> <b>sugar</b> {{in a food processor}} to make it finer.
