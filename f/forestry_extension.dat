By now we also know that markets alone are unable to prevent this either. [...] Eventually local stakeholder participation will be required. Much of Ethiopia’s national budget is covered by international development aid. [...] Not surprisingly international aid agencies should also play a prominent role in sustainable forest management. The government of Ethiopia has asked several international agencies, like the Japanese ICA, the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and FARM-Africa to get involved in Participatory Forest Management. Such projects aim at developing forest management plans and signing contracts between local communities and the government.

50|$|The Weeks Act {{had allowed}} the {{purchase}} of land to enlarge the National Forest System. Two years after the Weeks Act had been passed, over 700,000 acres (2,800 km²) had been purchased for the National Forest system in the Eastern United States. More than 2 million acres (8,000 km²) of land had been purchased by 1920. The Clarke-McNary Act {{made it easier for}} the Forest Service to buy this land. It made it much easier for them to buy land from willing sellers within predetermined national forest boundaries. The Clarke-McNary Act enabled the Secretary of Agriculture to work cooperatively with State officials for better forest protection, chiefly in fire control and water resources. It also provided for continuous production of timber. Additionally, under the Clarke-McNary Act, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began working with private forestland owners in reforestation. This was done by broadening the cooperative efforts to include producing and distributing tree seedlings and providing forestry assistance to farmers. These laws also gave a strong impetus to States to establish and support State forestry agencies. All 50 states now have a state forestry agency or <b>forestry</b> <b>extension</b> agency.|$|E

To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on farm <b>forestry,</b> timber management, <b>extension</b> <b>forestry,</b> reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.|$|R

Becker. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 241 pages, appendices 1 - 6. Recognizing the public value of {{sustainable forest management}} on private lands, governments have invested in programs to educate and assist landowners. However, landowner awareness of and enrollment in these programs are low. Applying a basic social network analysis approach, I investigated the role of personal networks {{in the flow of}} information and adoption of sustainable forest management behavior. Based on the results of a written survey, 90 % of 1767 owners of Minnesota forest land have received forestry information from at least one source including 65 % from a peer and 53 % from a professional forester. Personal forestry information network size ranged from 0 to 14 with a mean of 2. 92. Network size was positively associated with ownership size and the number of land management activities implemented. Landowner network results confirm the important role of public sector foresters, but also suggest opportunities for increased use of peer learning techniques to engage landowners as learners. <b>Extension</b> <b>forestry</b> programs are the primary providers of landowner education nationwide. A second study investigated the ways that these programs leverage landowner personal networks for education. The managers of 39 forestry-­‐ related peer learning programs train volunteers and use other peer learning techniques to inform and educate landowners about sustainable forest management. Relative to state-­‐level <b>Extension</b> <b>forestry</b> programs, a higher percentage of peer learning programs target smaller, often underserved, landowner groups. Although program outputs and demands for service are increasing, many peer learning program managers face reduced budgets and are turning to new technologies and techniques to maintain or grow their programs. In an environment of rapid changes in both the tools available to support Extension education programs and complex issues demanding a response, the results of these studies present both opportunities and challenges {{for the future of the}} nation’s <b>Extension</b> <b>forestry</b> programs...|$|R

40|$|It {{is found}} {{that at the}} present stage the funding of the {{forestry}} complex development priorities occurs in the following forms: 1) the budget financing of reforestation; 2) financial support of forestry and forest protection projects {{with the use of}} funds raised by public and private entities of forest entrepreneurship on the basis of self-financing activities; 3) the receiving of financial resources by forestry entrepreneurship entities as a result of compensation of losses in forestry production; 4) the financing of environmental protection measures relating to reproduction of the forest resource potential due to the environmental tax and the rent. There identified main negative factors affecting financial activities of permanent forest users — state forestry enterprises, which include: the lack of a mechanism of rational use of the forest resources export potential caused by the insignificant proportion of products with a high share of added value; a latent character of the mechanism for stimulating deep timber processing; underdeveloped mechanisms of regulating the flow of forest rents from the forestry to the timber processing segment of the forest-based sector. There improved theoretical and methodological approaches to diversification of forms and means of funding the development priorities of the forest-based sector, which involve raising the level of concentration of the investmentpotential of forestry and timber processing subdivisions of the territorial and forestry complex through forming integrated business associations of the holding and cluster type; separating the timber processing from forestry, which will ensure the equal level of access for timber processing businesses of different forms of ownership to unprocessed timber and will contribute to increasing the level of capitalization of forest and <b>forestry</b> assets; <b>extension</b> of the specification of forestry and forest protection activities, which will improve the efficiency of using the non-resource potential of the forest, logging waste, timber processing wastes and provide an increase in volumes of the funding of forestry production, including those based on public-private partnership agreements...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of policy {{instruments}} have been devised and applied to support the goals of sustainable forestry management. Community forestry programs can contain elements of several of those instruments. This paper considers the design of community forestry contracts in the Sumber Jaya area of Indonesia where community forestry contracts are agreements between the Forestry Department and community groups that provide group members with time-bound leasehold rights to protection forests, {{on the condition that}} farmers abide by specified land-use restrictions and pay any required fees. Farmers perceive that the contracts represent a bundle of restrictions and inducements, some of which are explicitly stated in the contract and others that are implied by the contract. Conjoint analysis was used to quantify farmers' tradeoffs among the explicit and implicit attributes of the contracts. The results of logit and ordered logit models show that farmers are most concerned about the length of the contract, and relatively unconcerned about requirements on tree density and species composition. An implicit attribute, greater access to <b>forestry</b> and agroforestry <b>extension,</b> emerges as an important implicit attribute. The results imply that farmers in this part of Indonesia would be willing to abide by fairly strict limitations on land use, provided that they can be assured of long-term rights to the planted trees.

Soil degradation increases substantially in the first 20 years after forest clearance for cassava and for sugarcane production and, thereafter, approaches an equilibrium. Significant increases of bulk density under cassava and clay dispersion index under sugarcane indicates oil compaction and soil structure decline. Significant decreases in soil organic carbon, labile carbon and exchangeable cations were observed under both cropping regimes, whilst acidification was significant under sugarcane.

40|$|The {{response}} of farmers to personalised <b>forestry</b> and agroforestry <b>extension</b> assistance {{has not been}} well documented in the Philippines, thus providing the impetus for this research in which the effectiveness of extended on-farm assistance was compared with more limited assistance. In four municipalities in Leyte Island, farmers responded positively to an extended program which helped them overcome problems in germinating and growing seedlings and establishing trees on their land. A limited assistance program which sought {{to make use of}} farmers' familiarity with growing and raising plants was relatively unsuccessful, with less preparation of tree planting sites and a higher rate of abandonment. Allowing farmers freedom to select planting sites and aspects of technical advice which suited their personal circumstances, encouraged a high degree of cooperation between extension staff and farmers, but 38 % of farmers neglected post-planting weed control and 35 % of sites were inappropriate for growing trees. Destruction of sites by flooding and grazing also caused farmers to blame extension staff even though these risks had been discussed with them beforehand. This suggested that a more interventionist approach would be appropriate for site selection although it may reduce recruitment. The number of farmers recruited through local government staff was low, but attendance by neighbours at locally held demonstrations was high, suggesting an avenue for further recruitment. Overall, the program was successful in shifting the initiative for further planting from extension staff to those farmers who received extended extension assistance...|$|R
