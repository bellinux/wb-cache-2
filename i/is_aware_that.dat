Although Goldschmidt {{could no longer}} be prosecuted for the offense, the Oregon State Bar began an {{investigation}} into the matter. Goldschmidt submitted a Form B resignation, which was received by the bar on May 13, where he says that he <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he would not be eligible for readmission.|$|E
5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court {{in cases where the}} applicant <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, you may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> your hand <b>is</b> resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.|$|R

5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{preceded by a}} brief prologue, {{delivered}} by Apollo. Venus and Cupid are then discovered, in conversation, on a desolate seashore. Venus informs Cupid that Duke Theseus of Athens, together with Ariadne, will soon be arriving {{on the island of}} Naxos on their way to Athens. They are fleeing from Crete, where the pair have been complicit in the slaying of Ariadne's monster half-brother, the Minotaur, in the labyrinth below the palace of her father, King Minos. Venus <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Theseus intends to abandon Ariadne on Naxos, and to proceed to Athens alone. Cupid offers to rekindle Theseus's passion for Ariadne, but Venus has decided to unite her with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this.|$|E

25|$|According to rabbinical law, a woman {{becomes a}} niddah when she <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> blood {{has come from}} her womb, whether it is due to menstruation, childbirth, sexually {{transmitted}} disease, or other reasons. If menstruation began before she sees evidence of it, the rabbinic regulations regard her as not being niddah until she notices. Until this point, the regulations do not come into force.|$|E

In 1990, Kappa Alpha Psi along with fellow NPHC organizations issued {{a joint statement}} announcing the elimination of pledging. The fraternity revised its membership development and intake process; instituted policies against hazing and has taken steps to reinforce and strengthen its stance against prohibited conduct. The fraternity backed its stance by releasing Executive Order One in 1988, Executive Order Two in 1993, and Executive Order Three in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The series spans 50 {{years of}} Quatermain's life, from 18 to 68; {{at the start}} of the {{foundation}} novel King Solomon's Mines, he has just turned 55. Physically, he is small, wiry, and unattractive, with a beard and short hair that sticks up. His one skill is his marksmanship, where he has no equal. Quatermain <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> as a professional hunter, he has helped to destroy his beloved wild free places of Africa. In old age he hunts without pleasure, having no other means of making a living.|$|E

Again, {{like all other}} Arabic historians, he was unclear on Greece before the Macedonian dynasty that produced Alexander the Great. He <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> there were kings before this, but is unclear on their names and reigns. He also seems unfamiliar with such additional aspects of Greek political life as Athenian democratic institutions. The same holds for Rome prior to Caesar. He is, though, the earliest extant Arabic author to mention the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.|$|E
25|$|Wynand {{offers to}} marry Francon, {{even though he}} <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> she is {{not in love with}} him. Francon defers the offer until she feels a great need to punish herself. She learns Roark's true {{identity}} when they are introduced at the party opening the Enright House, the new building that Roark has designed which The Banner has campaigned against. Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture to save himself from a hopeless struggle. Roark rejects her fears and says that they face many years apart until she adjusts her thinking.|$|E
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, von Furst <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{his wife}} still has strong {{feelings}} for Gibby. He sabotages the aircraft Gibby is to fly for a dangerous stunt, secretly applying acid to a control wire, not only out of jealousy, {{but also to}} add to the realism of his film with a real crash. However, unbeknownst to him, Woody decides to do the stunt in Gibby's place. Red sees von Furst tampering with the wires and alerts Gibby. Gibby takes off in another aircraft and catches up to Woody, but cannot make himself understood over the roar of their engines. The cable breaks, and Woody crashes and is killed.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> she is somehow disappointing both {{her children and}} her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|His {{father is}} just a name, which occurs in various forms, e.g., Entifidich in the Poppleton manuscript, Enfidaig, Amfredech, Anfudeg, and as Amfodech in the French king-list {{embedded}} in the Scalacronica. The list in National Library of Scotland MS, Advocates' 34.7.3, seems to say that Taran was the brother of King Nechtan m. Der-Ilei, which could mean that Taran's mother was the Pictish princess Der-Ilei. However, the latter list is problematic and places the reign of King Bridei m. Der-Ilei, Nechtan's brother, after Nechtan; on the other hand, the list {{is one of those}} that <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Bridei was the son of Dargart, indicating access to material not available to some of the other lists.|$|E

The Emperor <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides has become a potential challenger to his throne as he gains favor with other Great Houses in the Landsraad. The Emperor seeks to have House Atreides destroyed by assigning them control of Arrakis, currently ruled by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen of House Harkonnen. The Atreides and Harkonnen houses have had a generations-long feud, and the Emperor secretly plots with the Baron to attack House Atreides after they take control of Arrakis. While masking his involvement, the Emperor provides the Baron {{with some of his}} elite Sardaukar troops to aid the Baron's attack in disguise.|$|E
25|$|In Of the Standard of Taste, Hume {{argues that}} no rules {{can be drawn}} up about what is a tasteful object. However, a {{reliable}} critic of taste can be recognised as being objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and having extensive experience. Of Tragedy addresses {{the question of why}} humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a {{fundamentally}} different, {{new kind of}} epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised {{in the form of}} a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another ‒ if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he <b>is</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> what he is doing is wrong.|$|E
