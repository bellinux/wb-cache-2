This allowed passengers to cross <b>from</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> the line to the other when the train stopped at a station.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Aveling and Porter engines blew back {{into one of the}} train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
