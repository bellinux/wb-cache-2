The injection pressures and chamber back pressures employed were comparable to those existing in compression-ignition engines during injection. The construction of the nozzles was varied to determine the effect of the nozzle design on the coefficient.

50|$|The {{valve gear}} (or 'working gear') of a Newcomen or Cornish engine {{is based on}} the plug rod. This is a {{vertical}} rod, hung from the beam, and moving in parallel to the piston. Adjustable tappets are attached to this rod. These tappets strike long curved iron levers or 'horns' that are carried on three horizontal shafts or 'arbors'. Each arbor works one of the engine's valves. For the Cornish cycles, these valves are the upper steam inlet {{to the top of the}} cylinder, the equilibrium valve that links upper and lower portions of the cylinder, and the lower exhaust and condensing water <b>injection</b> <b>valves,</b> which share an arbor. Unlike most other steam engines, these engines could be run intermittently: making a single stroke before stopping and waiting for the valves to be restarted again. The speed of each power stroke or 'coming indoors' was a feature of the engine and was not easily varied, but there was no need for the engines to run continuously, stroke after stroke. This was a direct contrast to the rotative beam engine, and the rotary nature of almost all other steam engines. With the original Newcomen cycle, the speed of the return stroke varied according to the boiler pressure, although this still did not affect the strength or speed of the power stroke.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory {{in connection with}} a general research on fuel-injection for aircraft. The purpose of the {{investigation was}} to determine the factors controlling the reproducibility of spray penetration and secondary discharges after cut-off. The development of single sprays from automatic <b>injection</b> <b>valves</b> was recorded by means of special high-speed photographic apparatus capable of taking 25 consecutive pictures of the moving spray at a rate of 4, 000 per second. The effect of two types of <b>injection</b> <b>valves,</b> injection-valve tube length, initial pressure in the injection-valve tube, speed of the injection control mechanism, and time of spray cut-off, on the reproducibility of spray penetration, and on secondary discharges were investigated. It was found that neither type of injection valve materially affected spray reproducibility. The initial pressure in the injection-valve tube controlled the reproducibility of spray penetrations. An increase in the initial pressure or in the length of the injection-valve tube slightly increased the spray penetration within the limits of this investigation. The speed of the injection-control mechanism did not affect the penetration. Analysis of the results indicates that secondary discharges were caused in this apparatus by pressure waves initiated by the rapid opening of the cut-off valve. The secondary discharges were eliminated in this investigation by increasing the length of the injection-valve tube. (author) ...|$|E
