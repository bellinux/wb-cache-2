40|$|The {{accuracy}} of channel networks extracted automatically from a grid {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) generally relies on {{the selection of a}} Critical Source Area (CSA) threshold. Using an unique CSA within an entire DEM will lead to the assumption that all source (1 st order) channels have an equal contributing area. Thus, overshoot and undershoot problems, excessive and deficient representation of source channels, appear frequently in the channel network, especially for a DEM of a hydrologically heterogeneous region. This research focused on these problems by introducing fuzzy set theory for source channel identification and manipulation. A comprehensive valley morphology membership function is employed to calculate the CSA for each individual source channel. The function depends on the relationship between the contributing area and valley morphology. A new approach, Fuzzy <b>Identification</b> <b>Channel</b> Network Model (FICNM), is proposed and developed in the research.

40|$|Abstract — We {{discuss a}} {{technique}} that allows blind recovery of signals or blind identification of mixtures in instances where such recovery or identification were previously thought to be impossible. These instances include: 1) closely located or highly correlated sources in antenna array processing; 2) highly corre-lated spreading codes in {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) radio communication; and 3) nearly dependent spectra in fluorescence spectroscopy. These have important implications. In the case of antenna array processing, it allows for joint localiza-tion and extraction of multiple sources from the measurement of a noisy mixture recorded on multiple sensors in an entirely deter-ministic manner. In the case of CDMA, it allows the possibility of having a number of users larger than the spreading gain. In the case of fluorescence spectroscopy, it allows for detection of nearly identical chemical constituents. The proposed technique involves the solution of a bounded coherence low-rank multilinear approximation problem. We show that bounded coherence allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of the recovered solution. We will provide some statistical motivation for the approximation problem and discuss greedy approximation bounds. To provide the theoretical underpinnings for this technique, we develop a corresponding theory of sparse separable decompositions of functions, including notions of rank and nuclear norm that can be specialized to the usual ones for matrices and operators and also be applied to hypermatrices and tensors.

40|$|Abstract—Many second-order {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} recently for blind FIR channel identification in a single-input/multi-output context. In practical conditions, the measured impulse responses usually possess “small ” leading and trailing terms, the second-order statistics are estimated from finite sample size, and there is additive white noise. This paper, based on a functional methodology, develops a statistical performance analysis of any second-order approach under these practical conditions. We study two channel models. In the first model, the channel tails {{are considered to be}} deterministic. We derive expressions for the asymptotic bias and covariance matrix (when the sample size tends to) of the th-order estimated significant part of the impulse response. In the second model, the tails are treated as zero mean Gaussian random variables. Expressions for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimated significant part of the impulse response are then derived when the sample size tends to, and the variance of the tails tends to 0. Furthermore, some asymptotic statistics are given for the estimated zero-forcing equalizer, the combined channel-equalizer impulse response, and some byproducts, such as the open eye measure. This allows one to assess the influence of the limited sample size {{and the size of the}} tails, respectively, on the performance of identification and equalization of the algorithms under study. Closed-form expressions of these statistics are given for the least-squares, the subspace, the linear prediction, and the outer-product decomposition (OPD) methods, as examples. Finally, the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis is checked by numerical simulations; the results are found to be valid in a very large domain of the sample size and the size of the tails.
