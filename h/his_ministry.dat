5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} <b>his</b> <b>ministry.</b> In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and was essentially a laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|Branham's {{meetings}} as a faith healer {{started in}} 1946. He {{claimed to have}} received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946 commissioning his worldwide ministry. <b>His</b> <b>ministry</b> started to falter in 1955 and never regained the status it had in its initial stages. Branham {{died in a car}} accident in 1965.|$|E

They {{built a new}} chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near {{to the site of}} the original Meeting House. The pastor of the church at the time was Joseph Jeffries, and during <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s, {{prosperity}} gospel teachers embraced televangelism {{and came}} to dominate religious programming in the United States. Oral Roberts was among the first, developing a syndicated weekly program that became the most watched religious show in the United States. By 1968, television had supplanted the tent meeting in <b>his</b> <b>ministry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{grew up in}} Galilee {{and much}} of <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> took place there. The {{languages}} spoken in Galilee and Judea during the 1st century AD include Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, with Aramaic being predominant. There is substantial consensus that Jesus gave most of his teachings in Aramaic.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is {{considered}} {{the first person to}} receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus during his baptism and anointed him with power. Afterward, Jesus began <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> and displayed his power by casting out demons, healing the sick, and teaching with authority.|$|E

5|$|To aid in <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> to the Jewish people, Jesus {{was given}} the ability to perform miracles, by {{permission}} of God rather than by his own power. Through <b>his</b> <b>ministry,</b> Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E
5|$|Wills {{states that}} Rutherford seemed to relish his {{descriptions}} of how completely the wicked {{would be destroyed}} at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction.

5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E

50|$|In January 1942 Darlan {{assumed a}} number of other {{government}} posts.

5|$|Hensley's first {{experience}} with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914, after which he held snake-handling services in parts of rural Tennessee. His supporters later asserted that a revival broke out {{at the start of}} <b>his</b> <b>ministry,</b> a claim considered dubious by historians. At first, the Church of God did not object to his snake-handling services, and, in 1914, he held a snake-handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland, Tennessee. The next year, Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister, but required his wife's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy. He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine revelation while speaking. After being licensed, Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee, including revival services at church general assemblies. He preached about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, a Pentecostal teaching that referred to an additional spiritual experience after conversion. <b>His</b> <b>ministry</b> was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters, and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him. In the 1910s, Hensley is thought to have led churches in Grasshopper Valley (northwest of Cleveland, Tennessee); Cleveland; and Birchwood, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|His derision {{of working}} class British Labour {{politicians}} also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched {{while attempting to}} address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from <b>his</b> <b>Ministry</b> to co-ordinate the visit, and pointed {{out that they were}} breaking the law which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, the Presbyterian Church in Milton, Pennsylvania {{requested}} Waller's service, but he instead began preaching in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also preached in Wilkes-Barre and Lancaster in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton {{in early}} 1839. On May 1, 1839, he was ordained in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. His Presbyterian ministry began on a church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. When he began preaching, <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> covered all of Columbia County, {{as well as}} an area from Danville to the Wyoming Valley. In 1840, he stopped preaching at Briar Creek and Berwick, as they became part of a separate ministry. In 1842, he began preaching in Orangeville and New Columbia. he preached in Espy since at least 1857. Due to the size of <b>his</b> <b>ministry,</b> he was never able to preach at a given church more than once every two weeks and only preached at most churches once a month. He typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. Initially his salary was $600.|$|E
50|$|At a 16 December 2011 press conference, Minister of Education and Science Dmytro Tabachnyk {{said that}} <b>his</b> <b>ministry's</b> Russian {{counterpart}} admitted {{that it had}} mistakenly issued Slyusarchuk a duplicate diploma.

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> and {{attempts}} to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the swarm of locusts, which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone to the courtroom through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel to be innocent. However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends {{wanted to}} find him a more financially secure position. In 1772, {{prompted}} by Richard Price and Benjamin Franklin, Lord Shelburne wrote to Priestley asking him to direct the education of his children and to act as his general assistant. Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice <b>his</b> <b>ministry,</b> he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773.|$|E

25|$|Both <b>his</b> <b>ministries</b> {{were marked}} by {{continuing}} tension between Saionji and the powerful arch-conservative genrō, Field Marshal Yamagata Aritomo. Saionji and Itō saw political parties as a useful part of the machinery of government; Yamagata looked on political parties and all democratic institutions as quarrelsome, corrupt, and irrational.|$|R
50|$|In 1715, {{with the}} death of Louis XIV and the {{assumption}} of power by the Regent, Phélypeaux was compelled to resign <b>his</b> <b>ministries</b> in favour of his son Jean-Frédéric.

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Rüstungsstab allowed Speer, for the first time, to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht {{under the authority of}} <b>his</b> <b>ministry,</b> further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force. The task force oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the He 162, the Volksjäger ("people's fighter"), as part of the Emergency Fighter Program.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>ministry</b> in England, Toulmin {{served two}} Dissenting {{congregation}}s in Lancashire. From 1786 to 1788, he was pastor {{of a church}} in Monton, and from 1787 to 1793, he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton. He soon had nearly 1,000 followers, Many of his followers supported the French Revolution, attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England. A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin's absence to threaten his house, necessitating his swift return to protect his family. Upon arriving, {{he was able to}} break up the mob via diplomacy alone.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. <b>His</b> <b>ministry</b> was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
