40|$|The {{location}} of the lysyl residues which were accessible to labeling with a fluorescent reagent, iV-methyl- 2 -anilino- 6 -naphthalenesulfonyl chloride (Mns-Cl), in the pres-ence or absence of divalent metal ions was characterized by following the fluorescent peptides released from the labeled myosin on chymotryptic digestion. The Mns groups were mainly (more than 90 %) incorporated into myosin heavy chains (HCs), not into light chains (LCs) (less than 6 %). The groups were also found to remain in chymotryptic heavy meromyosin (more than 80 %). When the labeled myosin molecule was cleaved into subfragment- 1 (S-l) and myosin rod, most (more than 86 %) of the groups {{were found in the}} released peptides, Mns-Pl (6, 600 daltons) and a further degraded peptide, Mns-P 2 (4, 400 daltons), but not in S-l or the rod (less than 9 %). The fluorescent peptides corresponding to Mns-Pl and Mns-P 2 were also produced by chymotryptic digestion of <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> separated from the labeled myosin but not by similar digestion of LCs. The rate of produc-tion of these peptides from myosin was nearly equal to that of S-l-HC. The iso-lation of the peptides was achieved by gel filtration on Sepharose 6 B in 6 M guani...|$|E
40|$|Cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} (HCs) play {{important roles}} in insect communication but few studies clearly demonstrate the direct link between HCs and nestmate recognition. Therefore, cuticular lipids were extracted from ants, their HC and non-HC fractions {{as well as the}} three principal classes of HCs (n-alkanes, branched alkanes and alkenes) were purified and tested using an immobilizing "joust" device which allowed quantification of early pairwise behavioural responses, mandibular opening and antennal retraction, without occurrence of subsequent damages as in classic dyadic encounters. Chemical recognition of ants was studied at three levels of interactions (intra-colonial, intra-specific and inter-specific). Three closely related species already chemically characterized were used: Pachycondyla villosa (Pv), P. inversa (Pi) and P. subversa (Ps). Each species had its own behavioural responses. Moreover, responses of Pi and Ps towards Pv were significantly longer, than they were between themselves whereas Pv ants were equally aggressive towards Pi and Ps. These differences are in agreement with the results of the cluster analysis of the cuticular HCs profiles that place Pi closer to Ps. In support of the idea that components of cuticular lipids profiles are important for recognition, we found that only the <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> and its branched subfraction elicited a behavioural response of Ps workers. It is suggested that internally branched methyl- and dimethylalkanes are involved in recognition behaviour...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{designed}} {{a method to}} manufacture elevated fermented green tea by using Monascus pilosus, which {{is known as a}} functional microbe, and observe its antioxidant abilities and quality characteristics. The water-soluble substance (WSS) content of the fermented tea by M. pilosus (FTM) was lower than that of the non-fermented tea (NFT), although the alcohol-insoluble substance (AIS) content of the FTM was higher than that of NTM. On the other hand, the fractionated distilled water-soluble polysaccharide (DWSP), CDTA-soluble polysaccharides (CDSP), sodium carbonate-soluble polysaccharide (SCSP) and KOH soluble hemicellulose (HC) obtained from the AIS of the FTM was markedly higher than that of NFT. In the antioxidant parameters, the electron donating ability of all fractions, except HC, extracted from FTM was higher than that of NFT, and iron chelating ability of all fractions, except CDSP, extracted from FTM was higher than that of NFT. Whereas the DWSP and SCSP obtained from the FTM were higher than that of NFT, the activity of the <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> from both NFT and the FTM could not be detected. In addition, the xanthin oxidase (XO) inhibitory activities of the DWSP, CDSP and the SCSP obtained from the NFT were significantly higher than that of FTM, the aldehyde oxidase (AO) inhibitory activities of the DWSP and SCSP extracted from the FTM were markedly higher than that of the NFT. Meanwhile, the acceptance of NFT and FTM had no significant difference, while the quality of aroma, taste and mouthfeel o...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The crude extract {{and protein}} {{fractions}} of Hymenaea courbaril L. seeds were investigated {{for the presence}} of trypsin and papain inhibitors and antimicrobial activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Protein fractions were obtained from the crude extract after precipitation with ammonium sulfate into three saturation ranges (0 - 30 %, 30 - 60 %, and 60 - 90 %), called Hc 030, Hc 3060, and Hc 6090, respectively. The crude extract and protein fractions inhibited trypsin and papain activity, but to different degrees. Antimicrobial activity was observed in Hc 030 and <b>Hc</b> 3060 <b>fractions,</b> but only against V. parahaemolyticus. The inhibitor isolated from the <b>Hc</b> 3060 <b>fraction</b> was more effective in inhibiting trypsin (100 % inhibition) than papain (54 % inhibition), and showed an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa.

40|$|Biogenic gas is {{becoming}} increasingly important as an exploration target in the petroleum industry because it occurs in geologically predictable circumstances and in large quantities at shallow depths as free gas or gas hydrates. As accumulations of biogenic gas result in a subtle synchronization between early generation and early trapping, we integrated a macroscopic model of microbial gas generation within a 3 D basin and petroleum system forward simulator. A macroscopical model of low maturity / biogenic gas generation in which hydrocarbons are generated through first order kinetic reactions at low maturity has been developped. The transformation of substrate into biomass is described {{through a set of}} logistic equations coupled with the transport equations (advection and diffusion). The first results of the model (see 1) are consistent with the observations in terms of nutrients and microbes concentrations. Figure 1 : Species and microbes concentrations calculated by the 1 D model. In addition secondary biodegradation model has been developed, making use of the same methanogenesis reaction, which transforms the saturated and aromatic light <b>HC</b> <b>fractions</b> into methane and increases the oil density.

40|$|The {{cell wall}} (CW) has been {{recognized}} as the major target of aluminum (Al) toxicity. However, the components responsible for Al accumulation and the mechanisms of Al-induced CW function disruption are still elusive. The contribution of different CW components (pectin, hemicellulose 1 [HC 1], and HC 2) to adsorb Al {{and the effect of}} Al on xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolyase activity were investigated in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in this study. A fractionation procedure was optimized to effectively extract different CW components, especially to prevent the <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> from pectin contamination. When CW materials extracted from Al-treated roots (50 μm Al for 24 h) were fractionated, about 75 % of CW Al accumulated in the HC 1 fraction. A time-dependent kinetic study showed that only when the HC 1 fraction was removed was the amount of Al adsorbed decreased sharply. In vivo localization of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET) activity showed that Al greatly inhibited this enzyme activity within 30 min of exposure, which was concomitant with Al-induced callose deposition in roots. Results from real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that three genes may constitute the major contributors to XET activity and that the inhibition of XET activity by Al is caused by transcriptional regulation. These results, to our knowledge for the first time, demonstrate that HC is the major pool for Al accumulation. Furthermore, Al-induced reduction in XET activity could {{play an important role in}} Al-induced root growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considered}} {{aspects of}} cells and biomaterials required for effective tissue engineering of bone. Along these lines, we investigated cell characteristics decisive {{for the control}} of cell-biomaterial interactions and adhesion to three-dimensional carriers. We focused on cell characteristics required for selective cell adhesion. Bone marrow stromal cells are a promising source of osteoprogenitor cells and can easily be obtained by bone marrow aspiration in humans or by bone centrifugation in rodents followed by cell selection based on adherence to tissue culture plastic. We characterized the populations found in the adherent cell fraction of the rat bone marrow. We found that adherent cells included marrow stromal cells (MSC), which {{are a source of}} the progenitors of mesenchymal cell types, and hematopoietic cells (HC). To determine if the <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> had positive or negative effects on osteogenic differentiation, we separated MSC and HC immunomagnetically and combined them in controlled and varied proportions. Because we found that co-culturing the MSC with HC hindered MSC differentiation, we focused on enrichment strategies for MSC. We first varied the adhesion time of bone marrow cells after isolation. In the second step we focused on selective adhesion of MSC to the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the presence of HC. A rational approach to selective cell adhesion is the characterization of the ECM receptor expression pattern, i. e. integrin expression on the cell surface. We therefore investigated the integrin expression on MSC and HC depending on the time in culture. Moreover, we initiated investigations into the induced modification of integrin expression following the addition of growth factors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Emission of {{particulate}} matter (PM) constitutes a big {{threat to the}} climate {{as well as to}} human health. Therefore it is necessary to apply best available practice for all diesel vehicles as one means to reduce premature death [1]. Since the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is viable way to reduce PM emissions the detailed understanding of the DPF is important to enable improved performance. This includes oxidation kinetics, PM transformations and the fluid dynamics for PM capture. In order to enable systematic studies of this complex process, an experimental setup (Exhaust After Treatment System, EATS) that can isolate individual phenomena has been developed [2]. The PM is prone to contain volatile hydrocarbons (HC) which will influence both the capture efficiency as well as the performance of the catalyst. In a previous study, we have shown how the HC contribution can be isolated from the solid fraction [3]. In this work we present how an open (inert) monolith placed upstream the filter can be used to remove the volatile part of the PM. By isolating the volatile part from the solid part in-situ, the hydrodynamic process of PM capture is better understood which is vital when dealing with these very complex systems. Materials and Methods The EATS was used to study the PM from a single cylinder Heavy Duty diesel engine and the Capture efficiency (CE) over a novel metal substrate [4]. The temperature and linear velocity was systematically varied in combination with the effect of the inert monolith placed upstream. The particle size distribution (PSD) was measured using a Fast Particle sizer (DMS 500 from Cambustion) at different positions. Results and Discussion By applying the methodology developed earlier [3] the <b>HC</b> <b>fraction</b> of the PM could be determined. The difference between observed CE and theoretical CE is used to derive how much HC is needed to explain the capture efficiency over the inert monolith (for validation, see [5]). The PM exiting the inert monolith has no remaining volatiles [6] and the capture efficiency over the metal substrate in thus possible. From the Capture efficiencies in Figure 1, {{it can be seen that}} the CE over the inert monolith is influenced by HC content. The CE over the metal substrate is similar to previous studies on similar geometries [7]. Conclusions By applying an experimental methodology adapted for the highly transformative PM, the systematic study of CE over a novel metal substrate is enabled. These types of experiments are necessary to gain the understanding of the different processes in a DPF. By a detailed understanding improved performance and lowered emissions are possible...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if a basic protein was associated with the DNA of Bacillus subtilis W 168, and to determine if there was a difference in the amount and type of protein associated with the DNA at different times during the growth cycle of the organism. The amino acid compositions of the cellular proteins at these times were also determined for comparison with any protein found associated with the DNA. The plan of approach was to grow cells for 5, 8, and 11 hours, and to extract the DNA complexes from these cells according to a modification of the procedure described by Marmur. The "DNA/protein" ratios of the DNA complexes, based upon the Lowry and diphenylamine tests, were 1 : 0. 33, 1 : 0. 35, and 1 : 0. 36 for the 5, 8, and 11 hour cultures respectively. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of these DNA complexes showed that, except for the five hour culture, some material was associated with the DNA. An amino acid analysis of the DNA complex isolated from the eight hour culture showed the amino acids glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and methionine to be present in significant amounts. No basic amino acids were found in the sample. An unknown peak, possibly glucosamine, was also observed to be present. The DNA complexes were treated with 3 M NaC 1 to dissociate any protein from the DNA. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of the DNA samples obtained after this treatment were typical of those of pure DNA, indicating that some material had been removed. The material obtained from the dissociation treatment was found to contain very little protein. This material was treated with 0. 25 N HC 1 according to Butler and Godson's method for separating acidic and basic fractions. Very little acidic material was present. The three basic fractions were found to be similar when analyzed for total nitrogen, organic phosphorus, and amino acids. An amino acid analysis of the basic fraction obtained from the five hour culture showed the presence of trace amounts of all of the amino acids except lysine, histidine, arginine, and 1 / 2 cystine. The amino acids, however, were present in such low amounts as to make it uncertain that their presence was not due to contamination. An unknown peak, corresponding to the peak found in the amino acid analysis of the DNA complex isolated from the eight hour culture, was also observed to be present in this analysis. The middle layers obtained during the extraction of the DNA complexes were separated into acidic and basic protein fractions using 0. 25 N <b>HC</b> 1. These <b>fractions</b> were then hydrolyzed and analyzed for the presence of amino acids by two -dimensional paper chromatography. The basic protein fractions contained the most material, by weight, but very few amino acids were identified in these fractions. Most of the material present in these basic fractions was considered to be poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. The amino acids found in the acidic protein fractions were basically the same for all three cultures...|$|R
