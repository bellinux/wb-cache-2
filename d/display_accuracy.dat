40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} simple yet {{efficient}} calibration and registration procedure {{for improving the}} overall static <b>display</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the Visual Haptic Workbench. The procedure is used for precisely colocating the visual and hapticworkspaces {{of the system and}} is divided into three stages. First, we calibrate and register the PHANToM to the display surface of the workbench. Second, we calibrate the tracking system by attaching a rigid extensionbetween the tracker sensor and the PHANToM stylus. Third, we interactively find the remaining unknown display parameters including eye and hotspot offsets as well as a local reference frame.

40|$|Perspective {{synthetic}} displays that supplement, or supplant, {{the optical}} windows traditionally used for guidance {{and control of}} aircraft are accompanied by potentially significant human factors problems related to the optical geometric conformality of the display. Such geometric conformality is broken when optical features {{are not in the}} location they would be if directly viewed through a window. This often occurs when the scene is relayed or generated from a location different from the pilot s eyepoint. However, assuming no large visual/vestibular effects, a pilot cad often learn to use such a display very effectively. Important problems may arise, however, when <b>display</b> <b>accuracy</b> or consistency is compromised, and this can usually be related to geometrical discrepancies between how the synthetic visual scene behaves and how the visual scene through a window behaves. In addition to these issues, this paper examines the potentially critical problem of the disorientation that can arise when both a synthetic display and a real window are present in a flight deck, and no consistent visual interpretation is available...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{collecting}} data from commercial geolocation databases and its analysis. The theoretical part discusses techniques of IP geolocation, briefly describes commercial geolocation databases and mechanisms for accessing their geolocation services. The practical part of this thesis involves implementation of scripts for collecting and modification data retrieved from commercial geolocation databases for further analysis. First script collects the data and store them in output files in specified format. Second script modifies gathered data to achieve better accuracy. Detailed analysis is performed afterwards. Analysis is performed at several levels. This includes country, region and city accuracy as well as accuracy on latitude and longitude parameters. Output of this analysis will be conclusive, and will also <b>display</b> <b>accuracy</b> of tested geolocation services. The aim of this thesis is to analyze currently available commercial geolocation services and to prove their accuracy. Used scripts are implemented in Python programming language in version 3 using modules urllib, re and json. Scripts are test on commodity hardware with Linux operating system...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} a quantitative 3 D navigation system for CT-guided interventional procedures in a two-part study. Materials and Methods. Twenty-two procedures were performed in abdominal and thoracic phantoms. Accuracies of the 3 D anatomy map registration and navigation were evaluated. Time used for the navigated procedures was recorded. In the IRB approved clinical evaluation, 21 patients scheduled for CT-guided thoracic and hepatic biopsy and ablations were recruited. CT-guided procedures were performed without following the 3 D navigation <b>display.</b> <b>Accuracy</b> of navigation as well as workflow fitness of the system was evaluated. Results. In phantoms, the average 3 D anatomy map registration error was 1. 79 [*]mm. The average navigated needle placement accuracy for one-pass and two-pass procedures, respectively, was 2. 0 ± 0. 7 [*]mm and 2. 8 ± 1. 1 [*]mm in the liver and 2. 7 ± 1. 7 [*]mm and 3. 0 ± 1. 4 [*]mm in the lung. The average accuracy of the 3 D navigation system in human subjects was 4. 6 [*]mm ± 3. 1 for all procedures. The system fits the existing workflow of CT-guided interventions with minimum impact. Conclusion. A 3 D navigation system can be performed along the existing workflow and {{has the potential to}} navigate precision needle placement in CT-guided interventional procedures...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{typically}} combine {{linguistic and}} nonlinguistic information to comprehend emotions. We adopted an emotion identification Stroop task to investigate how different channels interact in emotion communication. In experiment 1, synonyms of “happy” and “sad” were spoken with happy and sad prosody. Participants had more difficulty ignoring prosody than ignoring verbal content. In experiment 2, synonyms of “happy” and “sad” were spoken with happy and sad prosody, while happy or sad faces were <b>displayed.</b> <b>Accuracy</b> was lower when two channels expressed an emotion that was incongruent with the channel participants had to focus on, {{compared with the}} cross-channel congruence condition. When participants were required to focus on verbal content, accuracy was significantly lower also when prosody was incongruent with verbal content and face. This suggests that prosody biases emotional verbal content processing, even when conflicting with verbal content and face simultaneously. Implications for multimodal communication and language evolution studies are discussed...|$|R

40|$|At translinear scales, the log power {{spectrum}} captures significantly more cosmological information {{than the standard}} {{power spectrum}}. At high wavenumbers $k$, the Fisher information in the standard power spectrum $P(k) $ fails to increase in proportion to $k$ {{in part due to}} correlations between large- and small-scale modes. As a result, $P(k) $ suffers from an information plateau on these translinear scales, so that analysis with the standard power spectrum cannot access the information contained in these small-scale modes. The log power spectrum $P_A(k) $, on the other hand, captures the majority of this otherwise lost information. Until now there has been no means of predicting the amplitude of the log power spectrum apart from cataloging the results of simulations. We here present a cosmology-independent prescription for the log power spectrum; this prescription <b>displays</b> <b>accuracy</b> comparable to that of Smith et al.

40|$|We tested seven visual depth cues ({{relative}} brightness, relative size, relative height, linear perspective, foreshortening, texture gradient, and stereopsis) at viewing {{distances of}} one and two meters to answer two questions. First, which cues provide effective depth information (i. e., only a small change in the depth cue results in a noticeable change in perceived depth). Second, how does {{the effectiveness of these}} depth cues change {{as a function of the}} viewing distance? Six college-aged subjects were tested with each depth cue at both viewing distances. They were tested using a method of constant stimuli procedure and a modified Wheatstone stereoscopic <b>display.</b> <b>Accuracies</b> for perceptual match settings for all cues were very high (mean constant errors were near zero), and no cues were significantly more or less accurate than any others. Effectiveness of the perspective cues (linear perspective, foreshortening, and texture gradient) was superior to that of other depth cues, while effectiveness of relative brightness was vastly inferior. Moreover, stereopsis, among the more effective cues at one meter, was significantly less so at two meters. These results have theoretical implications for models of human spatial perception and practical implications for the design and development of 3 D virtual environments...|$|R
40|$|Computational gene {{prediction}} using generative models {{has reached}} a plateau, with several groups converging to a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) incorporating phylogenetic models of nucleotide sequence evolution. Further improvements in gene calling accuracy are likely to come through new methods that incorporate additional data, both comparative and species specific. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which directly model the conditional probability P (y|x) of a vector of hidden states conditioned {{on a set of}} observations, provide a unified framework for combining probabilistic and non-probabilistic information and have been shown to outperform HMMs on sequence labeling tasks in natural language processing. We describe the use of CRFs for comparative gene prediction. We implement a model that encapsulates both a phylogenetic-GHMM (our baseline comparative model) and additional non-probabilistic features. We tested our model on the genome sequence of the fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Our baseline comparative model <b>displays</b> <b>accuracy</b> comparable to the the best available gene prediction tool for this organism. Moreover, we show that discriminative training and the incorporation of non-probabilistic evidence significantly improve performance.
