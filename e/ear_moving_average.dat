50|$|Variations of this {{calculation}} typically involve {{using different}} types of <b>moving</b> <b>averages,</b> such as an exponential <b>moving</b> <b>average,</b> a weighted <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> or an adaptive <b>moving</b> <b>average.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>moving</b> <b>average,</b> as a line by itself, {{is often}} {{overlaid}} in price charts to indicate price trends. A crossover {{occurs when a}} faster <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (i.e., a shorter period <b>moving</b> <b>average)</b> crosses a slower <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (i.e. a longer period <b>moving</b> <b>average).</b> In other words, this is when the shorter period <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> line crosses a longer period <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> line.

50|$|In the {{statistics}} of time series, {{and in particular}} the analysis of financial time series for stock trading purposes, a moving-average crossover occurs when, on plotting two <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> each based on different degrees of smoothing, the traces of these <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> cross. It does not predict future direction but shows trends. This indicator uses two (or more) <b>moving</b> <b>averages,</b> a slower <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> and a faster <b>moving</b> <b>average.</b> The faster <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> is a short term <b>moving</b> <b>average.</b> For end-of-day stock markets, for example, it may be 5, 10 or 25 day period while the slower <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> is medium or long term <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (e.g. 50-, 100- or 200-day period). A short term <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> is faster because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes. On the other hand, a long term <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> is deemed slower as it encapsulates prices over a longer period and is more lethargic. However, it tends to smooth out price noises which are often reflected in short term <b>moving</b> <b>averages.</b>|$|R

Only with preharvest hard wheat forecasts are the best <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> longer than 3 years. The differences in forecast accuracy among the different <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> are small {{and in most cases}} the differences are not statistically significant. The recommendation is to use longer <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> during time periods (or at locations) when there have been no structural changes and use last year’s basis after it appears that a structural change has occurred.

40|$|The {{debate over}} market {{efficiency}} continues to rage, {{yet it is}} difficult to argue with published evidence surrounding the efficacy of momentum trading based on <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> indicators. While prior studies find that a comparison of the market price to the 200 -day simple <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> provides a profitable trading strategy, such studies overlook many other popular price comparisons and calculation methodologies. Thus, I explore different trading rules, comparing strategies based on combinations of market price, 50 -day, 100 -day, and 200 -day <b>moving</b> <b>averages.</b> In addition, I calculate <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> using three alternative methods: simple, linear, and exponential.

Further, the search for an optimal length of <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> may be futile since the optimal length depends on how much structural change has occurred. Our recommendation is to use <b>moving</b> <b>averages</b> when there has been no structural change and to use last year’s basis or an alternative approach if the forecaster perceives that a structural change has occurred. basis forecast, grain, Law of One Price, <b>moving</b> <b>averages,</b> structural change, Marketing,...|$|R

During the simulation each cell in the automata produces two output states either BUY or SELL, that will help the traders to take better decision on stocks.
