Saxena.|$|E

5|$|Mabel Tolkien {{taught her}} two {{children}} at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him {{a great deal of}} botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> plants.

Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> Trek.|$|E

5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996 and brought to the {{attention}} of Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, director Guillermo del Toro, to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. Bayona wanted the film to capture the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> 1970s Spanish cinema; he cast Geraldine Chaplin and Belén Rueda, who were later praised for their roles in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} design was handled by Kumar's wife Vanita. After plans to shoot in Manipur were dropped because of safety concerns, extensive research {{was done to}} find locations similar to Manipur.

She recreated the look and <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> Manipur in Dharamshala and Manali.|$|E

5|$|To {{develop a}} better <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> how Voodoo was practised, Saltzman and Broccoli escorted Hamilton, Mankiewicz and {{production}} designer Syd Cain to scout New Orleans further {{and then the}} islands of the West Indies.

Despite viewing actual demonstrations, due to political unrest {{in the country at}} the time, it was decided not to film in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike.

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end}} of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E

5|$|Hawke {{starred in}} the 2005 action thriller Assault on Precinct 13, a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot. The film {{received}} ambivalent reviews; some critics praised the dark swift <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter's original. Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller Lord of War, playing an Interpol agent chasing an arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage. In 2006, Hawke was cast in a supporting role in Fast Food Nation, directed by Richard Linklater based on Eric Schlosser's best-selling 2001 book. The same year Hawke directed his second feature, The Hottest State, based on his eponymous 1996 novel. The film was released in August 2007 to a tepid reception.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 {{the college}} hired noted {{landscape}} architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. with bigger buildings like Olds and Agriculture Halls being built Olmsted faced {{the challenge of}} maintaining the informal character of campus while minimizing walking distance. In 1915, the Olmsted Brothers firm issued a report its solution was a dramatic redesign of campus around quadrangles However, the plan was unpopular with students and alumni who wished to maintain the informal parklike <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> campus. After eight years of consulting and little in way of changes the school ended its relationship with Olmsted in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
