5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are <b>hued</b> for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue {{is caused by the}} ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E

40|$|A <b>hue</b> {{descriptor}} {{based on}} Logvinenko’s illuminant-invariant object colour atlas [1] is tested {{in terms of}} how well it maps <b>hues</b> to the <b>hue</b> names found in Moroney’s Colour Thesaurus [2] [3] and how well it maps <b>hues</b> of Munsell papers to their corresponding Munsell <b>hue</b> designator. Called the KSM <b>hue</b> descriptor, it correlates <b>hue</b> with the central wavelength of a Gaussian-shaped reflectance function. An important feature of this representation is that the set of <b>hue</b> descriptors inherits the illuminate invariant property of Logvinenko’s object colour atlas. Despite the illuminant invariance of the atlas and the <b>hue</b> descriptors, metamer mismatching means that colour stimulus shift [4] can occur, which will inevitably lead to some <b>hue</b> shifts. However, tests show that KSM <b>hue</b> is robust {{in the sense that it}} is much more stable under a change of illuminant than CIELAB <b>hue...</b>|$|R

25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: <b>hue,</b> saturation and tone. <b>Hue</b> refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral <b>hues</b> of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure <b>hues,</b> so when speaking of the <b>hue</b> of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary <b>hues.</b> Ruby is defined to be red.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the perception of colorful ensembles {{and the effect of}} categories and perceptual similarity on their representation. We briefly presented ensembles of two <b>hues</b> and tested <b>hue</b> recognition with a range of seen and unseen <b>hues.</b> The average <b>hue</b> was familiar, even though it never appeared in the ensembles. Increasing the perceptual difference of ensemble <b>hues</b> inhibited this mean bias, and the categorical relationship of <b>hues</b> also affected the distribution of familiarity. The findings suggest there is an ensemble perception of <b>hue,</b> but this is affected by the categorical and metric relationships of the elements in the ensemble...|$|R

Here we use the intrinsic optical signal to image V 1 responses to spatially uniform stimuli of various <b>hues.</b> We found that (1) each of these stimuli activates an array of patches in the supragranular layers of the parafoveal V 1; (2) the patches activated by different <b>hues</b> overlapped partially; 3) the peak locations of these patches were determined by stimulus <b>hue.</b> The peaks associated with various <b>hues</b> form well-separated clusters, in which nearby peaks represent perceptually similar <b>hues.</b> Each cluster represents a full gamut of <b>hue</b> in a small cortical area (∼ 160 μm long). The <b>hue</b> order is preserved within each peak cluster, but the clusters have various geometrical shapes. These clusters were colocalized with regions that responded preferentially to chromatic gratings compared with achromatic ones. Our results suggest that V 1 contains an array of <b>hue</b> maps, in which the <b>hue</b> of a stimulus is represented by the location of the peak response to the stimulus. The orderly, organized <b>hue</b> maps in V 1, together with the recently discovered <b>hue</b> maps in the extrastriate cortical area V 2, are likely {{to play an important role}} in <b>hue</b> perception in primates...|$|R
