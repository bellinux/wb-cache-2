5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again {{this is due to the}} action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|The western magpie, G. tibicen dorsalis was {{originally}} {{described as a}} separate species by A. J. Campbell in 1895 and {{is found in the}} fertile south-west corner of Western Australia. The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies telonocua, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a scalloped black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges are worn away. Both sexes have black thighs.|$|E

25|$|Anaximander was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, {{and the first to}} present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> early to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E
25|$|The Arkansas State Military Board was {{responsible}} for authorizing and designating regiments of volunteers. The board did a reasonably good job of sequencing the unit designations {{through much of the}} war; however the Confederate War Department at Richmond tended to designate new regiments based upon when the muster rolls were received. Another reason for dual designations was administrative. In the case of the 35th Arkansas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more convoluted. Earlier, Col. George W. King's south Arkansas regiment had been designated by the State Military Board as the 22nd Arkansas. Since the rolls for the 20th Arkansas had not yet arrived at Richmond, the War Department assumed that Arkansas had skipped that number, so G. W. King's 22nd Arkansas was designated by the Confederate War Department as the 20th Arkansas. By the time the reorganized muster rolls of Col. James P. King's 35th Arkansas arrive in Richmond, the War Department noticed that the designation 22nd Arkansas wasn't being used (due to their previous error), so J. P. King's regiment was re-designated at the 22nd Arkansas. Colonel Henry J McCord assumed command of the 35th Arkansas Infantry on December 2, 1863, the re-disgnation of the 35th Arkansas to the 22nd Arkansas appears to have been effective {{at the same time that}} Colonel McCord assumed command.|$|E

She said in another interview: [...] "But if people prefer to give this song a perverse sense, it is their problem". Thus, she does not confirm the lesbian allusions that seem to emerge from the chorus (the French verb [...] "aimer" [...] can mean either [...] "to love" [...] or [...] "to like"). However, the song has been listed in several books dealing with homosexuality and explains the fact that many gay people were immediately attracted to Farmer's world.|$|E

When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the council estates the post-war Labour government built.

[...] He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows.

500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frightening to put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; {{the rest of the}} evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
