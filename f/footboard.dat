25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} renowned of the {{electric}} trams that operated in Sydney were the O and P class trams, known {{at the time as}} the <b>footboard</b> cars, after the surrounding <b>footboard</b> that conductors precariously balanced upon. These were later known as toastrack trams for their crossbench wooden seating layout. They had a seating capacity of 80 and a crush capacity of 150, and it was this capacity that was their selling point for Sydney's crowded system. They were commonly coupled together to run as double trams. 626 O class and 258 P class trams were constructed from 1908, and some remained in service until 1960.|$|E
25|$|The class {{remained}} largely as built until the 1920s. At that time, piston and valve tailrods were removed, wooden pilot beams were replaced with steel, <b>footboard</b> pilots replaced the pointed passenger-style previously fitted, and oil-burning headlights {{were replaced by}} electric lights.|$|E
50|$|Though {{not truly}} {{parts of a}} bed frame, headboards, <b>footboards,</b> and bed rails can be {{included}} in the definition. Headboards and <b>footboards</b> can be wood or metal. They can be stained, painted, or covered in fabric or leather.|$|R
5000|$|Paddleboxes 24-27 the [...] "paddlebox" [...] {{cars are}} {{so-called}} {{due to their}} unusual <b>footboards</b> that are built to accommodate protruding bogies ...|$|R

25|$|Paracanoeist {{race in the}} {{traditional}} kayak (K) discipline and in va'a (V), which is canoe with an outrigger, that helps the canoeist to poise the boat. The contenders are divided into three classes according {{to the level of}} their disability. Participants in LTA category have functional use of their legs, trunk and arms for paddling, and they can apply force to the <b>footboard</b> to propel the boat. TA class paddlers have functional use of the trunk and arms, but they are unable to apply continuous and controlled force to the <b>footboard</b> to propel the boat due to the weakened function of their lower limbs. Canoeist who have no trunk function are classified in the A category. At the World Championships 200 metres single events were organized for both genders in both disciplines in every disability class, however, a minimum of six competing national federations for each category were required in order to be a valid championship.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Rod Hardy, making it his first credit for the series. Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon. The parasitic creature {{that was used in}} the episode was created using animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug. During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully's back, the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson. To create the illusion that the creature was crawling up the body, the fiberglass was placed on top of Anderson, and then the animatronic slug was pressed against the fake back. Anderson later described the scene as [...] "fun to shoot", although she also called it [...] "exhausting" [...] because she had to struggle on the bed, all the while tied down, with her arms being attached to the headboard and her legs to the <b>footboard.</b> Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen [...] "start to lose it" [...] during the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Electrification {{started in}} 1898, {{and most of}} the system was {{converted}} by 1910. An exception was the privately owned Parramatta line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881 to Redbank Wharf (Duck River) where the steam tram remained until 1943. Service began with C-class saloon cars, followed by D-class combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and saloon cars, Sydney started by going the other way. <b>Footboard</b> trams continued to be introduced, notably E-class, K-class, and the double-bogie cars O-class and P-class trams required the conductor to collect fares from the <b>footboard</b> of the car, as those trams had no corridor. Revered though those trams were, they were deathtraps for conductors. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the <b>footboard</b> by passing motor vehicles. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways. From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents to tram employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding. [...] 63 of the falls were fatal. [...] Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries. [...] It was not until the 1930s with the introduction of the R-class that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, <b>footboard</b> trams continued in wide use until the late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.|$|E
50|$|The Moto Guzzi California is a cruiser {{motorcycle}} manufactured {{and marketed}} by Moto Guzzi since 1971, {{with a standard}} seating position, <b>footboards,</b> heel-and-toe gearshift, and linked (discontinued for the new 1400 models) Brembo brakes.|$|R
5000|$|... 100 Class: The [...] "oersik" [...] was {{designed}} by the NS Service of Rolling Stock and Workshops and built by Berliner Machinenbau A.G. Due to the broad and low mounted <b>footboards</b> the enginedriver could easily mount and dismount.|$|R
50|$|Many of the chain's {{restaurants}} are located inside renovated warehouses and historic locations. The restaurant decor traditionally features antiques, including chandeliers, brass headboards and <b>footboards</b> as bench backs for booths. Each restaurant's most prominent feature is a streetcar {{in the middle}} of the restaurant with seating inside.|$|R
2500|$|Scores of {{accidents}} – some fatal – befell tram conductors while collecting fares from the <b>footboard</b> of moving trams. [...] Very early trams were enclosed, but those built {{from the early}} 1900s had no corridor. [...] These trams included E-class, K, L, P, and O-class. [...] Many falls are recorded in the Sydney Morning Herald. [...] The most common injuries included death, head injuries including fractured skull and concussion. Examples of fatal falls {{are found in the}} same publication.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{spectacular}} of Kiya’s monuments is a gilded wooden coffin of costly and intricate workmanship that {{was discovered in}} Tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. The coffin's <b>footboard</b> contains an Atenist prayer that was originally intended for a woman, but was later revised to a refer to a man – with enough grammatical errors to betray {{the gender of the}} original speaker. The style of the coffin and the language of its surviving inscriptions place its manufacture in the reign of Akhenaten. Scholarly opinion now makes Kiya its original owner. [...] The richness of this coffin, which is comparable in style to the middle coffin of Tutankhamun, provides further evidence of Kiya’s exalted status at Amarna.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} play [...] "doubles", {{proponents of the}} [...] "heel up" [...] {{technique}} use either one of two techniques: the [...] "slide technique" [...] or the heel-toe technique. In the slide technique, the pedal is struck around the middle area with the ball of the foot. As the drum produces a sound, the toe is slid up the pedal. After the first stroke, the pedal will naturally bounce back, hit the toe as it slides upwards, and rebound for a second strike. In the heel-toe technique the foot is suspended above the foot-board of the pedal. The entire foot is brought down and the ball of the foot strikes the pedal. The foot snaps up, the heel comes off the <b>footboard,</b> and the toes come down for a second stroke. Once mastered either technique allows the player to play very fast double strokes on the bass drum. Noted players include Rod Morgenstein, Tim Waterson (who formerly held the world record for the fastest playing on a bass drum), Tomas Haake, Chris Adler, Derek Roddy, Danny Carey, Hellhammer. The technique is commonly used in death metal and other extreme forms of music.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Model D was announced, it was {{followed}} by a Model E, with the wheelbase reduced from 65 to 58 inches, a raised instep on the <b>footboards</b> and a two-speed rear hub. Prices ranged from $295 for the standard model and $335 for the two-speed model.|$|R
5000|$|... 1919 - 1923 : Branded as the Bown Villiers, extant {{versions}} of a Villiers 269cc touring model still survive The machine was equipped with a two-speed gearbox, drip-feed lubrication and a Bosch magneto. It had aluminium <b>footboards,</b> Saxon forks and Miller lighting set. The exhaust included an aluminium damper box.|$|R
50|$|Carriages were 20 {{feet long}} and 7 feet wide. They had six wheels and were first, second or third class with {{capacity}} for 24, 32 and 60-70 passengers respectively. They had <b>footboards</b> to allow passengers to board at locations with no or low platforms. The third class carriages were open to the elements.|$|R
60|$|A smart burly man, {{with acute}} features, {{stepped on the}} <b>footboard</b> of the carriage, and, moving with the train, asked what sort of rug it was.|$|E
60|$|But he did neither: and, when he {{was sitting}} alone in the deserted tram, he tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the {{corrugated}} <b>footboard.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fortune favoured me. The train had not left, {{though it}} was just in motion. I {{had no time to}} take a ticket, but leaping upon the moving <b>footboard,</b> I {{wrenched}} open a carriage-door and sprang in.|$|E
5000|$|The Suzuki FZ50 was a step-through {{commuter}} moped, {{described by}} a Motor Cycle News road tester in 1979 as [...] "the most attractive moped I've seen and must take the run-about class into a new area of perfection" [...] with [...] "sporty alloy spoked wheels" [...] but having small, [...] "ineffective" [...] legshields with footpegs, not <b>footboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Soldiers {{from every}} Southern {{state in the}} Confederacy, except Virginia, are {{represented}} in the cemetery. Wooden headboards with the soldier's personal identification were installed. <b>Footboards</b> were added in 1867. The fence was added {{with the assistance of}} Georgia author Mary Ann Harris Gay, whose brother had died in the battle. She raised $5,000 to fund the iron fence and gate, which is marked with a plaque bearing her name.|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} with most early Australian {{motorcycle}} companies, their machines were manufactured primarily from British parts. The B&B machines used JAP engines and Chater-Lea frames. They included 2.5 hp., 3.5 hp. 4 hp. (500cc), 6 hp. (770cc) and 8 hp. (1000cc) machines. Two piece tubular frame with engine as a stressed member. Used Druid forks and had large diameter (26 inch) wheels. Notable for a unique suspension system coupling the seat to the <b>footboards</b> (from ~1916).|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't help it,' he {{repeated}} sullenly, 'you must go when you're commandeered.' And then he climbed {{down off the}} <b>footboard,</b> and I did not see him again--one piteous item of Gladstone's legacy--the ruined and abandoned loyalist in the second generation.|$|E
60|$|Ossipon followed. “Wait {{till you}} are lying flat {{on your back}} {{at the end of}} your time,” he retorted, jumping off the <b>footboard</b> after the other. “Your scurvy, shabby, mangy little bit of time,” he {{continued}} across the street, and hopping on to the curbstone.|$|E
60|$|I {{understand}} he drives a hackney-coach, though {{how he does}} it, unless he stands on the <b>footboard</b> behind, and lies along the roof upon his chest, with his chin in the box, {{it would be difficult}} to comprehend. He brought his gun with him, as a curiosity.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} of an American Expeditionary Force barracks showing a double-decked bunk, ca. 1915. The wooden beds are at center and are long and narrow. They are stacked {{on top of each}} other and have simple dark blankets. There are various military essentials hanging from the head and <b>footboards</b> of the beds, and there is a window at right. The walls of the barracks are made of wood planks, and the floor is also made of wood...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>footboards</b> were reconfigured, the {{locomotive}} bell {{was removed from}} the front pilot and mounted midway between the radiator fans and dynamic brake fans, and a roof-mounted beacon and cab air conditioning system was installed. The unit retained its one-piece windshield and nose-mounted classification lights. When all of the modifications were complete, {{the locomotive}} was given a fresh coat of Yellowbonnet paint and reassigned as #4633 (all SD26s were given a 100-place [...] "bump" [...] in numbering to reflect their new class).|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century during the era of trams rising in Europe and USA, trams in some cities became overcrowded, so some {{passengers}} began a practice of riding on <b>footboards,</b> doors, couplers and sometimes on the roofs of trams. Also, train surfing often occurred in European countries during the war conflicts, especially during the First World War, Russian Civil War and World War II. Soldiers and refugees often traveled on the roofs of carriages due to lack of seats inside.|$|R
6000|$|... "As he sat {{watching}} the carriages of the express which were (on {{account of the}} state of the line) going at the same pace as himself, he suddenly saw some people in it whom he knew. We will suppose for the sake of our theory that these people were a woman whom he loved and a man whom he hated--and who in return hated him. The young man was excitable and impulsive. He opened the door of his carriage, stepped from the <b>footboard</b> of the local train to the <b>footboard</b> of the express, opened the other door, and made his way into the presence of these two people. The feat (on the supposition that the trains were going at the same pace) is by no means so perilous as it might appear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{expect you}} at five,' said Wardle. 'Now, Joe!' And Joe having been at length awakened, {{the two friends}} {{departed}} in Mr. Wardle's carriage, which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy, who, {{if there had been}} a <b>footboard</b> instead, would have rolled off and killed himself in his very first nap.|$|E
6000|$|I couldn't get {{the dear}} child {{to lie down}} or leave go of me, and indeed I hadn't the heart to try, so I stepped out on the <b>footboard</b> with her holding round my neck.

5000|$|The QT50 and {{the similar}} Honda Express share a skeletal, almost insect-like appearance. The Yamahopper {{is not really}} a scooter, as the QT50 has no fairing, sports footpegs rather than <b>footboards,</b> and its {{two-stroke}} reed valve engine is slung beneath the monotube frame motorcycle-style. The QT50 closely resembles contemporary mopeds, but without the bicycle pedals typical to the class, leading some to refer to such vehicles as [...] "nopeds." [...] The Yamahopper has an approximate top speed of 30 mph in stock form, and thus can be used for city driving.|$|R
5000|$|The Velocette LE was {{launched}} at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1948 as the [...] "Motorcycle for Everyman". With a 149 cc four-stroke, side-valve, water-cooled, horizontally opposed twin-cylinder engine, the LE {{also had a}} radiator and was fitted with coil ignition to help starting. The hand change three-speed gearbox, engine and clutch were contained in special castings, and final drive was by a shaft mounted in a swing frame with adjustable suspension. Aluminium leg shields were designed to keep the rain off, and <b>footboards</b> gave it a scooter feel.|$|R
2500|$|A {{pilot was}} usually {{fixed to the}} front end of locomotives, {{although}} in European and a few other railway systems including New South Wales, they were considered unnecessary. Plough-shaped, sometimes called [...] "cow catchers", they were quite large and were designed to remove obstacles from the track such as cattle, bison, other animals or tree limbs. Though unable to [...] "catch" [...] stray cattle, these distinctive items remained on locomotives until the end of steam. Switching engines usually replaced the pilot with small steps, known as <b>footboards.</b> Many systems used the pilot and other design features to produce a distinctive appearance.|$|R
