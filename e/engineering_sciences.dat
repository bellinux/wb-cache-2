5|$|In 1938, Dartmouth {{president}} Ernest Martin Hopkins successfully lobbied the Board of Trustees {{to construct}} an independent facility for the school. $200,000 were spent to build Horace Cummings Memorial Hall, which with several major additions (built in 1945-46 and 1989) served as Thayer's only facility for nearly 70years. In 2004, construction began on the MacLean <b>Engineering</b> <b>Sciences</b> Center (ESC), which was completed in 2006. At the cost of nearly $21million, the new center adds both classroom and research space to the Thayer School.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Thayer School saw {{expansion}} into new fields such as nanotechnology and biochemical engineering, as well as collaboration with such nearby institutions as Dartmouth Medical School, the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. In the early first decade of the 21st century, the core curriculum for undergraduates was revamped under Dean Lewis Duncan (1998–2004), making the school's offerings more accessible to non-major Dartmouth students. The MacLean <b>Engineering</b> <b>Sciences</b> Center (ESC), completed in 2006, was a $21million project to expand the school's classrooms and research centers.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the {{department}} of engineering mechanics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University changed its name and undergraduate program to <b>engineering</b> <b>science</b> and mechanics.

5|$|Istanbul University, {{founded in}} 1453, {{is the oldest}} Turkish {{educational}} institution in the city. Although originally an Islamic school, the university established law, medicine, and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after {{the founding of the}} Turkish Republic. Istanbul Technical University, founded in 1773, is the world's third-oldest university dedicated entirely to <b>engineering</b> <b>sciences.</b> These public universities are two of just eight across the city; other prominent state universities in Istanbul include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, which served as Turkey's primary institution of art until the 1970s, and Marmara University, the country's third-largest institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|Thayer School of Engineering offers {{graduate}} and undergraduate education in <b>engineering</b> <b>sciences</b> at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. The school {{was established in}} 1867 with funds from Brig. Gen. Sylvanus Thayer, known {{for his work in}} establishing an engineering curriculum at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Located in a two-building complex along the Connecticut River on the Dartmouth campus, the Thayer School today offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees, as well as dual-degree programs with institutions throughout the US. Over 500students are currently enrolled at Thayer, overseen by a faculty of 56 and preceded by over 4,500 living alumni of the school. In 2016 Thayer became the first US national research university with a graduating class of engineering undergraduates that was over 50% female.|$|E
