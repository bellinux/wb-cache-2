All diets were formulated to. 80 % lysine,. 90 % Ca,. 80 % P, and 1. 47 Mcal ME/lb. Sows fed diets with <b>extruded</b> ingredients tended to wean more pigs with greater survivability and greater litter weight gains compared to sows fed the ground sorghum-SBM-based control diet. No differences occurred in sow weight or sow backfat loss. Sows fed <b>extruded</b> soybeans had decreased sow weight loss (14. 6 vs 29. 7 lb) compared with those fed <b>extruded</b> sorghum. Overall, improvements in litter weight gain were 6, 7, and 10 % for <b>extruded</b> sorghum, <b>extruded</b> soybeans, and the <b>extruded</b> blend, respectively, when compared to the ground sorghum- SBM-soy oil-based control.

When McGrath left the project due to {{creative}} differences, Fish, the game's artist, pursued a platform game direction with Renaud Bédard, the game's programmer, {{who wrote the}} game's level editor and game engine from scratch. Levels were built in 3D by <b>extruding</b> surfaces with Photoshop-created textures. Bédard and Fish were joined by three different animators and other collaborators. The game was first announced in June 2007 and won an award at the 2008 Independent Games Festival and entered the public spotlight. Fish created a studio, Polytron Corporation, and was later aided by nearby developer-publisher Trapdoor when Polytron ran out of money. Fez won several more prerelease awards, including the 2012 Seumas McNally Grand Prize.|$|E

40|$|Relationships {{between the}} {{structural}} properties of raw. and <b>extruded</b> com starches and their functionalities were investigated using mixtures of these starch types. <b>Extruded</b> starch had higher water absorption and water solubility indices, and produced lower RVA viscosity profiles {{when compared with}} raw starch. It also had no differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) endotherm. Gel cohesiveness and adhesiveness of both starch types were similar, while <b>extruded</b> starch gels were softer. <b>Extruded</b> starch produced lower Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) viscosity profiles than raw starch due to starch degradation during extrusion. The raw and <b>extruded</b> starch components bad negative interaction coefficients, thus RVA viscosity parameters were lowered as the fraction of <b>extruded</b> starch in the mixture increased.

40|$|A {{total of}} 150 {{weanling}} pigs (14. 2 lb avg body wt) {{was used in}} a 28 -d growth assay {{to determine the effects}} of using sodium sulfite as an extrusion enhancer for soy products. Treatments were: 1) soybean meal (SBM), 2) SBM + sodium sulfite, 3) <b>extruded</b> SBM, 4) SBM <b>extruded</b> with sodium sulfite, 5) <b>extruded</b> whole soybeans, and 6) whole soybeans <b>extruded</b> with sodium sulfite. For d 0 to 14, pigs fed SBM had greater average daily feed intake (ADFD, although they had poorer efficiency of gain (F/G) than pigs fed the <b>extruded</b> soy products. Also, pigs fed sodium sulfite showed a trend for greater average daily gain (ADG) and F/G compared to pigs fed diets without sodium sulfite. The positive response to sodium sulfite continued into Phase II (d 14 to 28), where pigs fed sodium sulfite had greater ADG and ADFI compared to those not fed sodium sulfite. Pigs fed <b>extruded</b> soybeans in Phase II had greater ADG than pigs fed <b>extruded</b> SBM. Overall (d 0 to 28), pigs fed diets with sodium sulfite consumed more feed, gained faster, and tended to have improved efficiencies of gain rompared to those fed diets without sodium sulfite. Also, pigs fed <b>extruded</b> soybeans had greater rates and efficiencies of gain than pigs fed <b>extruded</b> SBM. Thus, in conclusion, sodium sulfite improved growth performance of weanling pigs.

25|$|In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of France, {{invented a}} process which uses glass as a {{lubricant}} for <b>extruding</b> steel. The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used to make kilogram mass standards. The process starts by heating the materials to the <b>extruding</b> temperature and then rolling it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5 to 0.75nbsp&mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls {{and allow it to}} act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18nbsp&mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.|$|E

25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process.

The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content.

25|$|Since {{the fall}} of 2008, AVO has flown 13 gas {{measurement}} flights, and of these, 5 have occurred since the eruption began on March 15, 2009. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates (up to 2000 tonnes/day) were measured in October–November, 2008. Starting in late January 2009, and coincident with a strong increase in seismicity, gas emission rates rose to a level (> 5000 tonnes/d) suggesting significant unrest at the volcano, and emissions stayed at this level until the eruption began. Since that time, emissions of both CO2 and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have been very elevated, sometimes reaching levels in excess of 10,000 tonnes/d. These volcanic gas emission rates are among the largest ever measured in Alaska, though such high values are consistent with an openly degassing volcanic system that is actively <b>extruding</b> lava.

25|$|The female {{fruit fly}} prefers a shorter {{duration}} {{when it comes}} to sex. Males, on the other hand, prefer it to last longer. Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females. First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings. Soon after, the male positions itself {{at the rear of the}} female's abdomen in a low posture to tap and lick the female genitalia. Finally, the male curls its abdomen and attempts copulation. Females can reject males by moving away, kicking, and <b>extruding</b> their ovipositor. Copulation lasts around 15–20 minutes, during which males transfer a few hundred, very long (1.76mm) sperm cells in seminal fluid to the female. Females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom-shaped spermathecae; sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization. A last male precedence is believed to exist: the last male to mate with a female sires about 80% of her offspring. This precedence was found to occur through both displacement and incapacitation. The displacement is attributed to sperm handling by the female fly as multiple matings are conducted and is most significant during the first 1–2 days after copulation. Displacement from the seminal receptacle is more significant than displacement from the spermathecae. Incapacitation of first male sperm by second male sperm becomes significant 2–7 days after copulation. The seminal fluid of the second male is believed to be responsible for this incapacitation mechanism (without removal of first male sperm) which takes effect before fertilization occurs. The delay in effectiveness of the incapacitation mechanism is believed to be a protective mechanism that prevents a male fly from incapacitating its own sperm should it mate with the same female fly repetitively. Sensory neurons in the uterus of female D. melanogaster respond to a male protein, sex peptide, which is found in sperm. This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination. The signal pathway leading to this change in behavior has been determined. The signal is sent to a brain region that is a homolog of the hypothalamus and the hypothalamus then controls sexual behavior and desire.|$|E
