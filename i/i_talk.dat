25|$|Murakami is {{a serious}} {{marathon}} runner and triathlon enthusiast, {{though he did not}} start running until he was 33 years old. On 23 June 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discusses his relationship with running in his 2008 memoir What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About When <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.|$|E

500|$|Even as {{a colonial}} pioneer, Crease {{clung to the}} aristocratic traditions of Britain. The Crease family's home in New Westminster was Ince Cottage, on Sapperton Road, named for the castle that belonged to Henry's mother's family in England. He sent his sons to Haileybury College in England for their schooling, and was dismayed to note that, [...] "While you and <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of the Old Country as 'Home,' all our {{children}} call Canada 'home.'" ...|$|E

[...] She has noted the difficulty of getting attention to some of the topics she feels most strongly about; at a Futures Without Violence summit in 2012, she said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about rape in Congo, people turn their backs and run, especially the men." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman rarely {{mentioned}} {{his personal life}} in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would [...] "rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to." [...] For the last 14 years of his life, {{he was in a}} relationship with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the play In Arabia We'd All Be Kings, which Hoffman directed. They lived in New York City and had a son, Cooper (2003), and two daughters, Tallulah (2006) and Willa (2008). Hoffman and O'Donnell separated in the fall of 2013, some months before his death.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{has also}} {{stressed}} the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of [...] "the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because... that takes [...] inside the way that the character enters". He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy: [...] "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. When <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Dubbing [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of her career, singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as [...] "very exciting, a little terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming". On recording the song, Mollenhauer said, [...] "The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel. I get choked up every time <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about it because I think it's such a beautiful moment." [...] Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses, it was mandatory that Mollenhauer's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore's husky speaking voice [...] "seamlessly." [...] Mollenhauer's performance of [...] "Someday" [...] is featured on the re-release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E

500|$|The Harry Potter {{series has}} been criticised for {{supposedly}} supporting witchcraft and the occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling {{refused to speak}} out about her religion, stating, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, {{will be able to}} guess what's coming in the books". However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows. For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross. Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that [...] "my belief and my struggling with religious belief... I think is quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a rap verse {{performed}} by Jay Z, whose lines include: [...] "I talk big money, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> big homes / I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome / Million dollar voice, came through phone / We heading to the top, if you coming, come on". He raps at a slow pace and incorporates both double entendres and humorous remarks, including a sexual reference that Claire Suddath viewed was an indication of Jay Z's enjoyment on the song: [...] " [...] had it by her bladder, she's like 'Oh I gotta pee!'." [...] Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly remarked that he [...] "even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can fly out to Pisa / Just to get some pizza." ...|$|E
500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E

500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Rock My World" [...] is {{credited}} {{as being an}} uptempo disco-pop and R song that has vibrating vocal harmonies. The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E4 to Bb5. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] has a moderate tempo of 95 [...] beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7–C9-Bm7–Am7–D–Em7. The song's composition {{has been compared to}} Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the disco-theme from Jackson's 1979 single, [...] "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". Chris Tucker voices the vocal introduction of the song while all the instruments heard on the track were played by Jackson and Rodney Jerkins. Lyrically, the song's lyrics are about being in love, as well as the effect that it can have, as evident in the opening line, [...] "My life will never be the same, 'cause, girl, you came and changed the way I walk, the way <b>I</b> <b>talk,</b> I cannot explain".|$|E
500|$|Love denied ever telling Wilson [...] "don't {{fuck with}} the formula", {{adding that the}} Beach Boys [...] "have no formula. In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 20, Thome hit {{his first}} home {{run with the}} Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome {{was placed on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot [...] memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about it all the time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Anderson {{wrote her}} next single with Bette Anderson, which was {{released}} in April 1965 called [...] "I Can't Remember". The single peaked at No.9 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart and No.30 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart. In October 1965, Smith released her second studio album Cute 'n' Country. The album featured both cover versions of other country songs and newer songs written by Bill Anderson. It included cover versions of songs by such artists as Jim Reeves, Webb Pierce, and Ray Price. Like her first album, Cute 'n' Country reached No.1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and spent thirty {{weeks on the chart}} as well. Her next two singles, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> to Him" [...] and [...] "Nobody But a Fool (Would Love You)", both reached No.4 on the Hot Country Singles chart and were issued on Smith's third album, Miss Smith Goes to Nashville (1966). The album peaked at No.2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. With her next few sessions, Smith's producer Bob Ferguson felt pressured from RCA headquarters in New York City to market Smith's sound toward more [...] "middle-of-the-road" [...] country pop material. This change of sound was evident on her next two studio albums Born to Sing (1966) and Downtown Country (1967). Both albums featured full orchestras in the background and cover versions of singles by pop artists of the time. Spawned from Born to Sing and Downtown Country [...] were the singles [...] "Ain't Had No Lovin'" [...] and [...] "The Hurtin's All Over", which both peaked within the Top 5 on the Hot Country Singles chart.|$|E
