500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{replaced}} as writer/director by Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, {{in what would}} have been his directorial debut. He had enthused, [...] "Not only can I recite the original Fletch movie line for line, I actually read all the Greg Mcdonald books as a kid. Consider me obsessed— I'm going to try as hard as I can not to screw this up." [...] Lawrence was signed to direct both Fletch Won and a sequel. Scrubs star Zach Braff was rumored to be in talks for the lead role, and in January 2007, Braff posted on his web site that [...] "Bill Lawrence is writing and directing Fletch in the spring and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to play young Fletch, but no firm plans are in place yet. He is still writing the script." [...] In April 2007, Braff announced that he had dropped out of the film to work on his own film, Open Hearts. In June 2007, it was announced that Lawrence was off the project and had been replaced by Steve Pink.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to know that, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to know {{also that}} the {{knowledge}} had come to me from my bishop. I should have thought evil of any one who had sent me the vile ribaldry. But coming from him, it fills me with despair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One day Spotkirk {{came to me}} {{and told}} <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do a piece of {{business}} for him, for which he would pay me twenty-five dollars. I was glad to hear this, for I was greatly in need of money, and I asked him what it was <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Child, {{he would}} use you exactly as <b>he</b> used <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to let him have you--already. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> to train you--he said you'd be {{beautiful}} some day." ...|$|R
60|$|ELLIE. It {{seems to}} me quite fair. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> for one thing: I want him for another.|$|E
6000|$|... "George," [...] she said, [...] "as long as <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> I'll {{stick to}} him. He's {{never been a}} good father to me; but if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> I'll stick to him. As to being gentle, it's not in me. I wasn't brought up gentle, and you can't teach an old dog new tricks." [...] Those were the last words she spoke to him, and they had, at any rate, the merit of truth.|$|E
60|$|EVE [angrily to the snake] This {{death that}} you have brought into the garden is an evil thing. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to die.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. He {{sent me a}} message. He wasn't {{satisfied}} with doing a dirty trick. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to know that he'd done it.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; he's {{preoccupied with}} other matters that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to talk to}} you about," [...] said her husband, hesitatingly. [...] "He is--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{happened}} to know," [...] Tavernake explained, [...] "that I was intimate with your sister. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to ask Beatrice a certain question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Forgot it!' cried Alfred, raising himself passionately. 'He {{always does}} forget everything! He don't care for me one farthing! I believe <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> dead!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My brother Joe {{has just}} rung me up from Lords. The county are playing Middlesex and they're one short. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to roll up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--if {{he wears}} stockings. I know he doesn't. He always wears socks. He told me so. Whatever he has, I'll mend,--or make if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, shucks, this hasn't got {{anything}} to do with dissipation. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to challenge that derned Italian savage, and I wouldn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{for what}} he said, I may skip that, aunt. It was the old story, I suppose, merely {{signifying}} that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't he though? But he just did. And {{what do you}} think, Em'ly? <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> once to {{sit with}} him on a barrel of gunpowder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know he wouldn't, Abel. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to be a minister. Ministers {{are good}} things to be, but I'm afraid I can't be a minister." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Bradley {{was out of}} the room, Sir Richmond remarked: [...] "I {{saw that}} nerves man, Dr. Martineau, to-day. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to take a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--after a fashion. There is no {{knowing how}} long it will last. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to do three things, and I won't do any one of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Noel {{shook her}} head. [...] "It's {{no good to}} funk it. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me,</b> and now <b>he's</b> got me. Oh! why did he? It'll be awful for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to be papa and him the coachman. Sometimes I {{make him}} a pirate, and he likes that, and once I made him a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to help him, and to {{find out}} if you wanted to marry him, so I paid {{particular}} attention to what he said, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then, {{you shall}} know. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to {{re-enter}} political life, {{to be the}} jackal to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{had this}} over so often, haven't we? I cannot leave Reginald {{as long as}} <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> relies upon {{me as much as}} he does now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haggles and higgles. He higgles passionately. He goes {{white and}} {{breaks into a}} cold perspiration. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> now to include the gardener's tools--in {{whatever}} price we agree upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's see," [...] she remarked, [...] "it's only {{a quarter}} to eight. Three {{quarters}} of an hour—! But what can <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> for?—I never knew anything like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came in with}} Mr. Rover; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to come," [...] was the answer. And as {{the teacher}} {{continued}} to glare at her, Nellie clung tightly to Tom's arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking to {{you about}} Australia!" [...] I cried, {{pricking}} my ears. [...] "Why, what harm was there in that? Why on earth didn't <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to talk about Australia?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{odd that}} you should be {{discovering}} hidden virtues in Lord Wisbeach, father. I've been trying to make up my mind about him. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to marry him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm so sorry,' said Mary; 'I've just promised Eddy. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to {{meet him}} at Stephano's, but--' She hesitated. 'Why shouldn't we all lunch together?' she went on, impulsively.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. He doesn't {{want his}} rent at all. He's broken his tooth on a Brazil nut; and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> {{to look at}} it and to lunch with him afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But why,' exclaimed Bobino, 'does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to die? What evil have I done him, or what fault have I {{committed}} that {{he should}} wish to bring about my death?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To my {{going into}} medicine? He said he’d be hanged if he’d {{take any of}} my doses. He didn’t think I should succeed; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to go into the}} house.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And smoke our pipes there,--quite comfortable. And then <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to go and}} fling {{ourselves}} into the river. That was uncommon civil, wasn't it? And then he well nigh choked me." ...|$|R
