Differences in the behaviour of cholate and deoxycholate have been noted. Fluorescence polarisation studies of 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene solubilised in bile salt micelles suggest a higher microviscosity for the interior of the deoxycholate micelle as compared to cholate. 1 H NMR studies of deoxycholate over the range 1 – 100 mg/ml suggest that micelle formation leads to a greater immobilisation of the C 18 and C 19 methyl groups as compared to the C 21 methyl group.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>dehydrocholic</b> <b>acid</b> (3, 7, 12 -trichetocholan- 24 -oic acid) is generally {{carried out by}} chemical oxidation of cholic acid (3, 7, 12 -trihydroxycholan- 24 -oic acid), with liquid Bromine and other reactants commonly used in oxidative synthesis processes. However, although convenient because of their low cost, their use involves drawbacks like the environmental impact and formation of undesired by-products, like brominated or chlorinated derivatives. In this light, it has been thought of interest to try the preparation of <b>dehydrocholic</b> <b>acid</b> by anodic oxidation of cholic acid. Experiments {{have been carried out}} in alkaline aqueous media and in aquo-organic media (water-dimethylether of ethylene glycol). In the latter case the v/v ratio between the organic solvent and water was 2 : 1. Sodium perchlorate has been used as supporting electrolyte. Experiments have been carried out without and with mediation by active chlorine, using sodium chloride as mediation precursor. The oxidative process has been studied at Ti/PbO 2, Ti/Pt and graphite anodes. At Ti/PbO 2 electrodes the direct electrochemical oxidation of cholic acid does not occur, both in aqueous and aquo-organic media. The conversion could be achieved only through chloride mediation. The optimal NaCl concentration was about 14. 0 g dm- 3. Higher concentrations caused a decrease of the faradaic yield of the oxidation process. Temperature and current density also play an important role. Decrease of the faradaic yield was observed with increasing the electrolysis temperature.

40|$|Background & Aims: Secretin induces bicarbonate-rich hydrocholeresis {{in healthy}} individuals, {{but not in}} {{untreated}} patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) – the first choice treatment for PBC – restores the secretin response. Compared with humans, secretin has poor effect in experimental normal-rat models with biliary drainage, although it may elicit hydrocholeresis when the bile-acid pool is maintained. In view {{of the benefits of}} UDCA in PBC, we used normal-rat models to unravel the acute contribution of UDCA (and/or taurine-conjugated TUDCA) for eliciting the biliary secretin response. Methods: Intravascular and/or intrabiliary administration of agonists and inhibitors was performed in normal rats with biliary monitoring. Secretin/bile-acid interplay was analyzed in 3 D cultured rat cholangiocytes that formed expansive cystic structures with intralumenal hydroionic secretion.

The last one with the potential - 1800 mV is probably the main peak given by reduction of carboxylic group of side chain of steroid skeleton. By cyclic voltammetry was determined that the process is quasireversible and is strongly influenced by adsorption of DHCA on the electrode surface and also by the pH which determines dissociation degree of carboxylic group.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between the secretion of biliary phospholipid (PL) and bile acid suggests a regulatory effect of bile acid on PL secretion. Bile acids may influence PL synthesis and/or the mobilization of a preformed PL pool. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the contribution of these two sources to biliary PL, by using an experimental protocol in which <b>dehydrocholic</b> <b>acid</b> (DHCA) and cholic acid (CA) were infused to manipulate biliary PL secretion. In control rats, there was a steady state in bile flow. PL secretion and the biliary secretion of newly synthesized phosphatidylcholine (PC).

DHCA infusion decreased biliary PC secretion rate by 80 %, and secretion returned to normal values at the transport maximum of CA. The specific radioactivity of biliary PC was decreased by 30 % by DHCA infusion and reached normal values during CA infusion. There were no significant changes in the specific radioactivity of PC in plasma or cellular organelles during infusion of bile acids. These data indicate that: (1) newly synthesized PC contributes a small percentage to biliary PC; thus a preformed pool (microsomal and extrahepatic) is a major source of biliary PL; (2) the contribution of the extrahepatic pool to the biliary PL may be more important than the microsomal pool...|$|E
40|$|Retention {{coefficients}} (k) of {{cholic acid}} and its keto derivatives {{are determined by}} means of Reversed Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography at different temperatures (303 K, 309 K, and 313 K). At each studied temperature, retention factor decreases if the hydroxyl group in the cholic acid molecule replaces oxo group. In addition, the change of retention coefficient in a function of temperature (Delta k/Delta T) is dominant for the cholic acid while by {{increasing the number of}} oxo groups it decreases. Introduction of an oxo group in a bile acid molecule leads to the lower hydrophobicity of the beta side of the steroid nucleus. Because of that, less interaction happens between beta side of the steroid nucleus and stationary phase. For <b>dehydrocholic</b> <b>acid</b> (three- oxo derivative), the value for Delta k/Delta T shows an exception of this explanation. This suggests that in this molecule the planar polarity is disturbed. Partition coefficient K of nitrazepam (probe molecule) in micelles of bile acid salts at the examined temperatures shows a high linear correlation with retention factors of the selected bile acids. This indicates the importance of hydrophobic interactions in mixed micelles between the examined drug and bile acid salts. Haemolytic potential (erythrocyte haemolysis, log (Lys 50)) represents measure of membranotoxicity of bile acids. In addition, it is shown that haemolytic potential correlates highly with the retention coefficient. All experiments that we conducted to obtain the values of K and log (Lys 50) as well as their correlations with k, contribute to significance of retention coefficient as a measure of hydrophobicity in biopharmaceutical experiments...|$|E

40|$|Transepithelial {{movement}} {{of water and}} solute occurs both through the cell membrane as well as across the intercellular junctional complex (paracellular shunt pathways). Permeability of paracellular shunt pathways is increase by transmucosal osmotic gradients, and in certain epithelia these changes are associated with bullous-like deformations (blisters) of the zonula occludens and localization of lanthanum within junctional complexes. Although bile acids increase biliary secretion by osmotic forces, {{the source of this}} water movement into bile is not known. In the present studies we examined whether a choleretic infusion of sodium <b>dehydrocholic</b> <b>acid</b> (DHC) or its taurine conjugate, taurodehydrocholate, altered the solute permeability characteristics and morphologic appearance of the junctional complexes of rat hepatocytes. Animals were continuously infused for 1 hr with 1 % albumin [...] 0. 9 % NaCl alone or 120 mumol of DHC and bile flow and biliary clearance of [14 C]sucrose, an indirect marker of biliary permeability were measured. The number of intercellular blisters adjacent to the bile canaliculus were counted in an unbiased manner from photographs obtained with scanning electron microscopy. Bile flow and the biliary sucrose clearance remained unchanged in control animals whereas DHC infusions resulted in a progressive increase in the biliary clearance of [14 C]sucrose during the 60 min of infusion even though the choleretic response to DHC was stable during the final 30 min of infusion. DHC infusions produced surface invaginations, or blisters, (0. 1 [...] 0. 7 micrometer in diameter) which were located immediately adjacent to the hemi-bile canaliculus and occurred with a frequency of 1. 62 +/- 0. 08 per hepatocyte surface, which was fivefold greater than observed in controls. In separate groups of animals 5 mM ionic lanthanum chloride was perfused intraportally after taurodehydrocholate infusions, and the number of junctional complexes that contained the electron dense marker were quantitated by transmission electron microscopy. Localization of lanthanum in the junctional complexes of fasted control animals was not observed, whereas approximately equal to 50 % of the zonula occludens in DHC-infused animals contained lanthanum which was also occasionally identified within the lumen of the bile canaliculus. These results indicate that infusions of DHC cause blisters adjacent to the junctional complex of rat hepatocytes in association with changes in solute conductivity of the zonula occludens to cations such as ionic lanthanum chloride, and presumably to larger solutes such as sucrose. Qualitatively similar morphologic findings were also observed during the infusion of sodium taurocholate at physiologic rate (40 mumol/h). These studies suggest that the paracellular shunt pathway in the liver is an important site for bile acid-induced water and solute movement into bile...|$|E
