40|$|AbstractWe report stress {{birefringence}} {{measurements for}} small (up to 150 mm x 150 mm) samples such as Si slabs, wafers and small ingot segments. Measured stress birefringence in an Si ingot segment exhibits an interesting four-fold symmetry {{that may be}} caused by the crystal growth process or subsequent squaring or <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ingot.</b> Stress birefringence map for an axially cut and mechanically polished cross section of the seed end of a CZ-grown Si ingot shows striations that could be a visualization of the solid-liquid interface of silicon crystals. Two instruments are used for measuring these small Si samples. The first instrument is a near infrared (NIR) Exicor birefringence measurement system that employs photoelastic modulator (PEM) technology. This is a point measurement instrument. The second instrument is a camera-based NIR imaging polariscope that uses a fixed circular polarizer and a rotating analyzer. Both instruments are designed primarily for Si material research at significantly lower cost than the previously reported system for measuring large, pseudo-square, PV Si ingots. The two instruments described in this paper complement each other for different applications...|$|R

40|$|Grinding {{has always}} been a high energy {{expenditure}} process, which generally produce massive grinding heat and possibly produce thermal damage in workpiece ground surface. Therefore, a good understanding <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> temperature characteristics is important to lower the thermal effect on the workpiece quality. However, the grinding temperature characteristic differs when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> different materials, especially for those hard-to-machine materials (eg. Titanium alloys and ceramics). Therefore, this paper is devoted to investigate different grinding temperature characteristics for metallic materials and brittle materials. In order to detect the grinding temperature, a grindable thermocouple technique with NI-DAQ device is adopted in diamond wheel <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics and CBN <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. The results show that the temperature characteristics for ceramics is totally different with Titanium alloys. When the grinding wheel speed increases, the grinding temperature increases all the way when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. However, there is a temperature turning point for <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics. When the wheel speed surpasses the turning point, the grinding temperature goes down and closes at a relatively low temperature...|$|R
