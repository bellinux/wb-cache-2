5000|$|Avgas is {{currently}} available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. Because tetraethyllead {{is an expensive}} and polluting ingredient, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum. Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel {{has not yet been}} developed and certified for most of these engines. , numerous certificated reciprocating-engine aircraft require high-octane (leaded) fuels. Teledyne-Continental Motors states: [...] "Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the valve, guide, and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> wear {{due to the lack of}} lead. The result can be remarkable, with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours." [...] Lycoming has also provided a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them. A number of their engines are not compatible with unleaded fuel according to their chart.|$|E

The test rig consists of a pre-combustion chamber single cylinder diesel engine fully equipped for temperature measurements across different points in the cylinder head, cylinder liner and other critical areas of the combustion chamber. Four traversing thermocouples were installed across the cylinder head and five were fitted along the cylinder liner. Fixed thermocouples were fitted in the pre-combustion chamber tip, fuel injector nozzle tip, <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> and exhaust port. The effect of engine load on the heat flux {{and temperature}} level in the different places of the combustion chamber of the engine is presented for both diesel engine and dual fuel engine.

50|$|They {{were called}} Polyspheric or Poly engines, because they {{featured}} polyspherical-shaped (meaning “more than one sphere”) combustion chambers.

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its <b>seat.</b> To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the <b>valve</b> to its <b>seat</b> during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its <b>seat</b> {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its <b>seat.</b> Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its <b>seat</b> in the past.

50|$|When used {{in highly}} {{supercharged}} diesel engines with the corresponding low compression ratio of about only 14:1 or below, JP-8 causes troubles during cold start and idling due to low compression temperatures and subsequent ignition delay because the cetane index is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G to 40 or higher. Because lubricity to the BOCLE method is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G, modern common-rail diesel engines can experience wear problems in high-pressure fuel pumps and injectors. Another problem in diesel engines {{can be increased}} wear to <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> in the cylinder heads, because a minimum content of sulfur is not specified in MIL-DTL-83133G. Sulfur in fuel normally contributes to a build-up of soot layers on these <b>valve</b> <b>seats.</b> According to the notes in this standard, {{it is intended to}} include a cetane index value in one of the next releases.|$|R
50|$|TEL was {{extensively}} used as {{a gasoline}} additive beginning in the 1920s, wherein it served as an effective antiknock agent and prevented <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> wear.

25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>seats</b> {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel.|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl lead {{works as}} a buffer against microwelds forming between the hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and their <b>seats.</b> Once these <b>valves</b> reopen, the microwelds pull apart and leave the valves with a rough surface that would abrade the <b>seats,</b> leading to <b>valve</b> recession. When lead began to be phased out of motor fuel, the {{automotive}} industry began specifying hardened <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> and upgraded <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> materials to prevent valve recession without lead.|$|R

40|$|One {{interesting}} {{application of}} system identification {{method is to}} identify and control the heat transfer from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to the <b>seat</b> to keep away the valve from being damaged.

50|$|Vehicles {{designed}} and built to run on leaded fuel may require modification to run on unleaded gasoline or autogas. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed {{to compensate for the}} relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>seats.</b> Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane unleaded gasoline (or LPG) has reduced or eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.|$|R

5000|$|At 43 tons, with a 300 hp flat-12 Meadows engine, the A20 {{had limited}} power {{compared}} to the 18-ton Covenanter.

40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a valve guide is provided for each poppet valve in the cylinder head.
