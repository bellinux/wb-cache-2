5|$|Partitions of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century {{brought an}} end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna {{established}} a semi-independent Kingdom of Poland (known as Congress Kingdom) under control of and in personal union with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the arms of the Congress Kingdoma black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon.|$|E
5|$|Federer has a {{contract}} with Nike footwear and apparel. For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won, and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006. At Wimbledon 2008, and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan that also had his own logo, an R and an F joined together.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous {{explanations for the}} diseases. After being caught {{with one of these}} pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E
5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> {{the arms of the}} Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.|$|E
5000|$|The 12-floor {{building}} was 372 ft tall, including a 130 ft tower atop the building, <b>emblazoned</b> vertically <b>with</b> the name [...] "Richfield". Lighting on the tower {{was made to}} simulate an oilwell gusher and the motif was reused at some Richfield service stations.|$|R
60|$|Of {{all those}} radiant firms which <b>emblazon</b> <b>with</b> their windows the West End of London, Gaves and Cortegal were {{considered}} by Soames the most 'attractive' word just coming into fashion. He {{had never had}} his Uncle Swithin's taste in precious stones, and the abandonment by Irene when she left his house in 1887 of all the glittering things {{he had given her}} had disgusted him with this form of investment. But he still knew a diamond when he saw one, and during the week before her birthday he had taken occasion, on his way into the Poultry or his way out therefrom, to dally a little before the greater jewellers where one got, if not one's money's worth, at least a certain cachet with the goods.|$|R

5|$|Playford {{had begun}} {{experiencing}} {{serious health problems}} since his first heart attack in June 1971, and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years. On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service {{was held at the}} Flinders Street Baptist Church. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the phrase: 'a good man who did good things'.|$|E
5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does not touch the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Constitution {{does not}} make {{provision}} for a Vice-President. However, separate insignia for the President of the Senate, in exercise of duties as acting head of state under Article 86, was created in 1986. This has a white square on the blue field, charged with {{the arms of the}} Republic in silver. Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001; a tricolour {{in the style of the}} Presidential standard, it is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the Cypher of Honour of the President of the Republic.|$|E
60|$|With this Wellesley left {{me to go}} {{and smoke}} a cigar in the stables with Lord Gules, and make merry over the cattle there, under Stripes's superintendence. Young Ponto laughed with his friend, at the venerable four-wheeled cruelty-chaise; but seemed amazed that the latter should ridicule still more an ancient chariot of the build of 1824, <b>emblazoned</b> immensely <b>with</b> the arme of the Pontos and the Snaileys, from which latter {{distinguished}} family Mrs. Ponto issued.|$|R
5000|$|At the graveyard, {{every single}} grave was laid facing {{in the same}} direction, except for the {{traditional}} Robber’s Grave which is laid perpendicular to the rest, not facing the rising sun, and <b>emblazoned</b> simply <b>with</b> a cross and the large type words of [...] "Robbers Grave". One legend attributes it to a robber who was shot when he was caught stealing a tent from another miner, while other legends would have it that he instead stole a wheelbarrow, or that the thief died after being lynched.|$|R
60|$|A servant, whose livery seemed but {{a slight}} {{modification}} of the native dress, brought some dust-covered bottles. Marie, with her own hand, unlocked an oaken cabinet, and produced some quaint horn cups, <b>emblazoned</b> in gold, <b>with</b> the Reist arms. One larger than the others she set before the Prince.|$|R
5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|Pedro II was acclaimed, crowned and consecrated on 18 July 1841. He {{wore a white}} robe {{that had}} belonged to his {{grandfather}} Francis II, an orange pallium made of feathers from the Guianan cock-of-the-rock (a homage to Brazil's birds and indigenous Brazilian chieftains) woven by Tiriyó Indians especially for the emperor and a green mantle <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> branches of cacao and tobacco, both symbols of the Brazilian empire. After being anointed, he received the Imperial insignia (the Imperial Regalia of Brazil): the Sword (which had belonged to his father), the Scepter (of pure gold with a wyvern on its tip, symbol of the House of Braganza), the Imperial Crown (made especially for the coronation with jewels removed from Pedro I’s crown), the Globe, and the Hand of Justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} Greek flag of {{blue and}} white cross was first hoisted during the Greek War of Independence in March 1822. This was later modified so that the shade of blue matched that of the Bavarian coat of arms of the first King of Greece, Otto. The shield is <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the coat of arms of the Danish Royal Family, and the supporters on either side are also adapted from the Danish royal arms. Beneath the shield is the motto in Greek, Ἰσχύς μου ἡ αγάπη του λαου ("The people's love is my strength"). Beneath the motto dangles the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer, Greece's premier decoration of honor.|$|E
60|$|He {{does not}} sport a coronet and {{supporters}} upon his London plate and carriages; but his country-house is <b>emblazoned</b> all over <b>with</b> those heraldic decorations.

50|$|The Fatebenefratelli Church {{was built}} between 1727-1731. Its facade is eclectic. The first floor is {{decorated}} by through-gutter. The chamber with arc ending {{on the front}} has a Marie statue made by György Kis. The interior of the church was rebuilt in 1908. Its inlaid, wooden altars have exceptional artistic value. The baroque Italian main altar painting depicts the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. The frescos were painted by Endre Graits in 1908. The relief of Istenes Szent János, founder of Fatebenefratelli order was made by Ede Mayer sculptor. Its organ was fabricated in Anster’s workshop. On {{the western side of}} the church the chapel is rectangular. On the walls several <b>emblazoned</b> gravestones <b>with</b> few centimetre deep inscriptions allude to a vault under the church; however the location of its entrance is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|This {{rainbow flag}} in Italy {{was first used}} in a peace march in 1961, {{inspired}} by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons. It became popular with the Pace da tutti i balconi ("peace from every balcony") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in Iraq. The most common variety has seven colours, purple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange and red, and is <b>emblazoned</b> in bold <b>with</b> the Italian word PACE, meaning [...] "peace".|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} vexilloids (flag-like objects) used in Poland {{were known}} as stanice and probably resembled the Roman vexillum, that is a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear. They served as both religious and military symbols as early as 10th century. With Poland's conversion to Christianity in 966, the stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones. The royal banner of arms {{dates back to the}} reign of King Boleslaus the Generous (r.1076–1079), but it was during the reign of King Vladislaus the Elbow-High (r.1320–1333) that a red cloth <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the White Eagle of the arms of Poland was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of royal authority used at coronations and in battles.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{behind the}} church is Tre Kronor castle. Destroyed by fire in 1697 and {{subsequently}} replaced by the Stockholm Palace, it was named after the central citadel, a large gun tower <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the Three Crowns symbol, known as the first building in Stockholm and a symbol for the Swedish Crown. While {{it is not known}} when the symbol was first added to the citadel (it became the national coat of arms in the late 14th century), it was gilded during the 16th century. Again, the painting is strictly accurate, as the 1540s enlargement of the tower is not present in the image. The castle's eastern wing, the king's personal residence, was destroyed by fire in 1525 and in letters ten years later the king, burdened by debts of war to Lübeck, expressed his indignation over the fact that the reconstruction was still not completed. In the painting {{to the right of the}} church the eastern wing is accurately depicted as under construction, the exposed roof trusses confirming the inconvenience experienced by the monarch.|$|E
5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux tapestry, {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; {{as one of the}} combatants at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E
50|$|Abbott {{was born}} in Arlington, Texas on August 20, 1966, the son to Carolyn and Jerry Abbott, a country {{musician}} and producer. Before he wanted a guitar, Abbott asked his parents for a BMX bike. He took up the guitar when he was twelve, with his first being a Hondo-style Les Paul along with a small amplifier. Upon winning a series of local guitar competitions, the most notable of which {{was held at the}} Agora Ballroom in Dallas, Texas, Abbott was awarded a Dean ML. He then sold this guitar to luthier Buddy Blaze, who installed a Floyd Rose bridge and <b>emblazoned</b> it <b>with</b> Abbott's signature lightning bolt paint job; Blaze returned it some years later. Coincidentally, his father had also bought him a Dean ML the morning before the aforementioned competition, but one with a cherry sunburst finish instead. Abbott met his long-time girlfriend Rita Haney at a young age around the third grade.|$|R
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is <b>emblazoned,</b> in stone, <b>with</b> the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit.

5|$|With the {{establishment}} of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two bannersPolish and Lithuanianas equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> the arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in the field or with the Eagle on the obverse and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used.|$|E
5|$|The toad {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in {{the fact that it is}} at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its blackish, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from some dark hole. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented <b>emblazoned</b> <b>with</b> three toads. It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the witch's familiar, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried toads, their bile, faeces and blood. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present. In the Basque Country, the familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frías investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed toads. He found none. These witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews.|$|E

50|$|Among Kidron's many {{writings}} were Western Capitalism Since the War and Capitalism and Theory (1968). His main {{contribution was}} to develop {{the theory of the}} permanent arms economy, which argued that capitalism had been temporarily stabilized by the production of arms, which acted as a counter tendency to the falling rate of profit. Crisis, then, was not eliminated from the system, but merely postponed. This came at a time when other tendencies were <b>emblazoning</b> their publications <b>with</b> banner headlines proclaiming that capitalism had entered its final crisis. Related to this was the conception that state capitalism was a distinct period within the imperialist stage of capitalism and not simply a new label to be plastered upon the Russian state.|$|R
