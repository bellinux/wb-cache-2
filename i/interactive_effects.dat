40|$|International audienceGaudreau and Thompson (2010) {{provided}} a 2 2 model of perfectionism {{that focuses on}} the <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of two dimensions of perfectionism - personal standards perfectionism (PSP) and evaluative concerns perfectionism (ECP) - and distinguishes four sub-types of perfectionism. They evidenced an <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of PSP and ECP on general negative effect, i. e., the effect of ECP is reduced when PSP is high. They also hypothesized a similar effect on a measure of psychopathology. We respond to Gaudreau and Thompson (2010) by testing this <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> on depressive symptoms. Analyses of data from a student sample (N = 338) failed to evidence an <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of PSP and ECP on depressive symptoms. ECP was positively associated with depressive symptoms while a mild negative correlation between PSP and depression was observed. Although our results do not fully support Gaudreau and Thompson's 2 2 model, they suggest that some of the sub-types they proposed are relevant for predicting depressive symptoms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} whether flexibility and gender influence students' posture. MethodEvaluation of 60 {{female and male}} students, aged 5 to 14 years, divided into two groups: normal flexibility (n= 21) and reduced flexibility (n= 39). Flexibility and posture were assessed by photogrammetry and by the elevation of the lower limbs in extension, considering the leg angle and the postural evaluation. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were used for data analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess the joint influence of flexibility and gender on the posture-dependent variables. After verifying an <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> between the variables of gender and flexibility, multiple comparisons using the t test were applied. ResultsFlexibility influenced the symmetry angle of the knee (p 0. 05). There was an <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> between the variables of gender and flexibility on the knee symmetry angle (p< 0. 02). Male students with reduced flexibility had greater asymmetry of the knee {{when compared to the}} other subgroups.

40|$|Limited recent {{evidence}} implicates the anterior/posterior cingulate (ACC/PCC) {{and lateral}} prefrontal networks as the neural substrates of risky decision-making biases such as illusions of control (IoC) and gambler's fallacy (GF). However, investigation is lacking on the dynamic <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of those biases during decision making. Employing a card-guessing game that independently manipulates trial-by-trial perceived control and gamble outcome among 29 healthy female participants, we observed both IoC- and GF-type behaviors, {{as well as}} an <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of previous control and previous outcome, with GF-type behaviors only following computer-selected, but not self-selected, outcomes. Imaging results implicated the ACC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in agency processing, and the cerebellum and right DLPFC in previous outcome processing, in accordance with past literature. Critically, the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) exhibited significant betting-related activities to the interaction of previous control and previous outcome, showing more positive signals to previous computer-selected winning versus losing outcomes but the reverse pattern following self-selected outcomes, as well as responding to the <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of control and outcome during feedback. Associations were also found between participants' behavioral sensitivity to the <b>interactive</b> <b>effect</b> of previous control and previous outcome, and right IPL signals, as well as its functional connectivity with neural networks implicated in agency and previous outcome processing. We propose that the right IPL provides the neural substrate for the interaction of perceived control and GF, through coordinating activities in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and working conjunctively with lateral PFC and other parietal networks...|$|R
