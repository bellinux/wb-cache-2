I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Article IX is to create the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which is charged with {{administering}} the laws that regulate corporations. The State Corporation Commission also issues charters for Virginia corporations and licenses to do business for “foreign” (non-Virginia) corporations. Section 5 of Article IX prohibits such foreign corporations from <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> in Virginia that a Virginia corporation could not do.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} modulates {{the outputs}} of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E

5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of <b>doing</b> <b>anything,</b> basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting abilities are instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Following the Super Viernes on August 13, 2010, {{where he}} {{attacked}} La Máscara, Volador Jr. began being booked as rudo, although the on again, off again feud with Místico {{was put to}} the side in favor of Volador Jr. against La Sombra. The feud between the two led both wrestlers to be booked in the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show, a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match. Volador Jr. was the 10th man to leave the steel cage, keeping his mask safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him. On September 17, Volador Jr. {{picked up one of}} the biggest wins in his CMLL career, defeating Místico in the finals of a tournament to win the Copa Bicentenario. On October 5, 2010, Volador Jr. lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to La Máscara, ending his reign at 236 days. After losing the title, Volador Jr. spent several months not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> significant in CMLL until he took over the Los Invasores stable in July 2011, when its leader Héctor Garza turned tecnico. On September 18, Volador Jr. unsuccessfully challenged former partner La Sombra for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship, in a match that received rave reviews. Two days later, Volador Jr. led Olímpico and Psicosis II of Los Invasores to the Mexican National Trios Championship, when they defeated the trio of Ángel de Oro, Diamante and Rush. Volador Jr. continued his successful run on September 23 by defeating eleven other men in a torneo cibernetico to advance to the finals of the 2011 Leyenda de Plata. On October 7, Volador Jr. defeated Jushin Thunder Liger to win the tournament. Los Invasores lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. on December 16, 2011. On February 14, 2012, Volador Jr. defeated La Máscara to win the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship for the first time. On March 30, Volador Jr. lost the title to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) representative Prince Devitt.|$|E

At the time of its closing, fewer than 40 stores, including Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Finish Line and RadioShack remained open in the mall.

As of December 17, 2016, the mall is still empty and no progress had been made in <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> with it.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{between the}} forest {{tradition}} and the Thammayut administrative hierarchy escalated in 1926, when Tisso Uan attempted to drive a senior Forest Tradition monk named Ajaan Sing — along with his following of 50 monks and 100 nuns and laypeople — out of Ubon, which was under Tisso Uan's jurisdiction. Ajaan Sing refused, saying he {{and many of his}} supporters were born there, and they weren't <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> to harm anyone. After arguing with district officials the directive was eventually dropped.|$|E

His younger cousin, Kung Jin, makes his debut as a playable {{character}} {{and is one of}} the story's main heroes. It is mentioned that Kung Jin became a thief because his family fell on hard times after Kung Lao's death, and held hard feelings toward Raiden as a result.|$|E
25|$|The dynasty is {{regarded}} as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom. They were of Turkic descent. They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule. The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes, nor were they <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> out of the ordinary in the tribal context of Arabia. By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe, the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu.|$|E
25|$|For {{almost four}} decades, the nation's economy {{has also been}} damaged by risky credit, public debt creation, and mismanaged European {{structural}} and cohesion funds. Apparently, Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was unable to forecast or prevent the crisis when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and was later incapable of <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> to ameliorate the situation when the country {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy in 2011. In 2010, acronyms were widely used by international bond analysts, academics, and the international financial press when referring to the underperforming economies of Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.|$|E

25|$|According to Shia theologians, infallibility is {{considered}} a rational necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility {{is based on the}} Shia interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but {{due to the fact that}} they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> that is a sin.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E
25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that in the}} period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet {{was not able to}} forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> to ameliorate the situation when the country {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy in 2011.|$|E
