[...] Canadian actor Tom McCamus originally auditioned for the part of Old Nick before being cast as Leo.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} his life, he was publicizing his {{disappointment}} with the political environment of Greater Romania and explaining his return to socialism. In a Viața Basarabiei article, he claimed: [...] "Wherever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> me I see only decay. The old and the young, the cultivated and the illiterate, all behave equally, not even asking themselves what the meaning of their life is in the general progress of humanity. Living inside Romanian society I for one was not able to merge into it. [...] I haven't had and I still don't have friends in Romania." [...] His attitude, including claims that Bessarabia was being colonized by rapacious Romanians from other provinces, outraged the nationalist newspaperman Alexandru [...] "Ion Gorun" [...] Hodoș, who wrote that Arbore was no longer sincerely interested in national unity, but rather displayed [...] "the need to detect, under any Romanian uniform, an assassin of Bessarabia's population." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] exclaimed Mr. Crewe, [...] "and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> me and see {{the things}} crying {{to be done in}} this State, and no lawmaker with sense and {{foresight}} enough to propose them, it makes me sick. Now, for instance," [...] he continued, and rose with an evident attempt to assault the forestry shelves. But Austen rose too.|$|E

6000|$|Working at his {{chambers}} in the Temple, with a busy aspect, and {{his hair}} (where he is not bald) made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer's-wig, I come, in a later time, upon my dear old Traddles.

6000|$|...

Alas! you can't put hearty love for strangers into men's hearts by paying them salaries.|$|E
60|$|On {{this last}} head I am disappointed. Personally I like women {{a good deal}} fatter than most of you are, and better looking. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> this {{gathering}} I see {{one or two of}} you that are not so bad, but on the whole not many. But my own strong personal predilection is and remains in favour of a woman who can cook, mend clothes, talk when I want her to, and give me the kind of admiration to which I am accustomed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have things}} to say," [...] he declared, [...] "but I cannot say them. I {{have nothing to}} smoke--no cigarette, no cigar. I arrive here choked with dust.

[...] "My host, you are acquitted. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the table here at which I am invited to seat myself, and I perceive nothing but a few stumpy pens and unappetising blotting-paper. By chance I lift my eyes. I see the parting of the curtains yonder, and behold!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> at the others. Harry beamed approval, Johnston nodded indifferently, and I felt {{a thrill}} of {{satisfaction}} as I {{turned to the}} railroad autocrat.|$|R

60|$|Another Day.--The {{ground in}} all {{directions}} strew'd with debris from a storm. Timber creek, as I slowly pace its banks, has ebb'd low, and shows reaction from the turbulent swell of the late equinoctial. As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> I take account of stock--weeds and shrubs, knolls, paths, occasional stumps, some with smooth'd tops, (several I use as seats of rest, from place to place, and from one I am now jotting these lines,)--frequent wild-flowers, little white, star-shaped things, or the cardinal red of the lobelia, or the cherry-ball seeds of the perennial rose, or the many-threaded vines winding up and around trunks of trees.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> me I {{feel ashamed}} {{of my former}} apprehensions. If I trembled at the blast which has {{hitherto}} attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should hope not; {{but really}} when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> among my acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same {{may be said}} of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my word {{it is enough to}} put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to {{comprehend}} that a married woman has many things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper." ...|$|E
60|$|In Chicago at last! <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around.</b> <b>I</b> was in {{the heart}} of a great city, knowing no one, and with no idea of where to go.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> {{expecting to}} see the Major. I saw instead the Major's future prima donna {{standing}} just inside the door, with her round eyes steadily fixed on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adieu! my friend. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the {{familiar}} cabin, and miss your gentle faces. I feel as Jason might have felt, {{alone on the}} deck of the Argo when his companions were ashore, except that I know of no Circean influences to mar their destiny. In examining the state-rooms to see if my orders for the complete restoration of passengers' property had been carried out, I allowed myself to look into yours. Lying alone, forgotten and overlooked, I saw a peculiar jet hair-pin which I think I have observed in the coils of your tresses. May I venture to keep this gentle instrument as a reminder of the superior intellect it has so often crowned? Adieu, my friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] {{returned}} Angut, who was, how ever, cheered {{a little}} by his friend's tone and manner. [...] "Everything is mystery. I look up, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> I look within; all is dark, mysterious. Only {{on this is}} my mind clear--the Great Spirit is good. He cannot be otherwise. I will trust Him. One day, perhaps, He will explain all. What I understood not as a little boy, I understand now as a man. Why should there not be more light when I am an older man? If things {{go on in the}} mind as they have been going ever since I can remember, perfect light may perhaps come at last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do you tremble at me alone?" [...] cried he, {{turning his}} veiled face round {{the circle of}} pale spectators. [...] "Tremble also at each other! Have men avoided me, and women shown no pity, and {{children}} screamed and fled, only for my black veil? What, but the mystery which it obscurely typifies, has made this piece of crape so awful? When the friend shows his inmost heart to his friend; the lover to his best beloved; when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his Creator, loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin; then deem me a monster, for the symbol beneath which I have lived, and die! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> me, and, lo! on every visage a Black Veil!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> quickly. Hollis lay {{across the}} table with his head down upon his outstretched arms. And then {{he looked up at}} me and laughed in his {{ordinary}} manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is he?" [...] she replied, astonished. Where {{should he}} be? At home, of course." [...] <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> the luxuriously-furnished {{room with its}} air of cosy comfort, of {{substantial}} restfulness.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} I fancied he had some good reason for wanting to remain out of sight, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> in alarm {{to see what had}} caused the trouble.|$|R
