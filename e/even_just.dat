5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was a tactically {{versatile}} player, with a {{good understanding}} of the game, and was comfortable attacking on both wings or through the centre of the pitch; this allowed him to play anywhere along the front-line. His preferred position was in a free-role, as a creative, attacking midfield playmaker, although he was rarely deployed in this position throughout his career due to the prevalence of the 4–4–2 formation, in which he usually functioned as a striker. It was only in later years he was able to play in this free role more frequently. A prolific goalscorer, Baggio was an accurate finisher from {{both inside and outside the}} area, known for his composure in front of goal. Due to his excellent technique, he was a precise volleyer and a set piece specialist, renowned for his accurate bending shots and free-kicks. His free-kick technique influenced several other players, such as Alessandro Del Piero and Andrea Pirlo. During his time with Juventus, his free kick technique was described as cross between that of Maradona's, Zico's, and Platini's, as at the time, his ball-striking technique was thought to resemble Platini's, although, like Zico and Maradona, he preferred to take free kicks from close range, usually from a distance of around 20 to 16 metres from the goal, or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> outside the area, and to have the ball touched by a teammate first before striking it. Despite his decisive miss in the 1994 World Cup final shootout, Baggio was also a penalty kick specialist.|$|E

25|$|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or {{oesophagogastroduodenoscopy}} (EGD or OGD) is {{also called}} panendoscopy (PES) and upper GI endoscopy.

Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency.

25|$|Any prey {{that has}} the ability to jump or fly away will always be more {{effective}} in escaping than non-flying insects like the termites. However, many times those that do escape will still lose a leg or other appendage in the process, like 60% of the grasshoppers in this experiment. Because the prey is so much larger than the ants, <b>even</b> <b>just</b> getting this one appendage as a food source is a victory. For example, a hind leg of a grasshopper is still about 12.4 times the size of a single ant and a great resource in itself.|$|E

25|$|The spell, {{intended}} to last only seconds and function {{only within the}} new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal gameplay, as players did {{what they could do}} to avoid infection. Despite measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning of densely populated cities (or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> not playing the game), it lasted until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally controlled the spread.|$|E
25|$|It is easy {{to imagine}} a {{biological}} system where some components are complex multi-state molecules, whereas others have few possible states (or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> one) and exist in large numbers. A hybrid approach has been proposed to model such systems: Within the Hybrid Particle/Population (HPP) framework, the user can specify a rule-based model, but can designate some species to be treated as populations (rather than particles) in the subsequent simulation. This method combines the computational advantages of particle-based modeling for multi-state systems with relatively low molecule numbers and of population-based modeling for systems with high molecule numbers and a small number of possible states. Specification of HPP models is supported by BioNetGen, and simulations can be performed with NFSim.|$|E
25|$|One of Maradona's {{trademark}} moves was dribbling full-speed on {{the right}} wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight. This maneuver led to several assists, such as the cross for Ramón Díaz's header against Switzerland in 1980. He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker. His free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee {{at a very high}} angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> outside the penalty area.|$|E

25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and <b>even</b> <b>just</b> those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is not}} {{normally}} legal to keep these chameleons, {{it is possible to}} obtain special permission from the South African government to do so. These chameleons are better admired than handled. However, taming is possible through gentle and consistent (almost daily) contact, allowing trust to build up. This is typically achieved through careful and slow hand-based feeding of flies, small spiders, grasshoppers, etc. In cold weather, a sensitively handled B. pumilum commonly becomes eager to perch on a human hand for the warmth. To maintain them out of their natural environment requires advanced skills and is a demanding project; they require the right amount and type of ultraviolet exposure and large supplies of specific types of live food that are not easy to supply. They also require moisture, <b>even</b> <b>just</b> tap water sprayed gently onto the foliage with a hose.|$|E
25|$|It was {{realised}} {{as early}} as 1767 that the stars in a cluster were physically related, when the English naturalist Reverend John Michell calculated that the probability of <b>even</b> <b>just</b> one group of stars like the Pleiades being {{the result of a}} chance alignment as seen from Earth was just 1 in 496,000. Between 1774–1781, French astronomer Charles Messier published a catalogue of celestial objects that had a nebulous appearance similar to comets. This catalogue included 26 open clusters. In the 1790s, English astronomer William Herschel began an extensive study of nebulous celestial objects. He discovered that many of these features could be resolved into groupings of individual stars. Herschel conceived the idea that stars were initially scattered across space, but later became clustered together as star systems because of gravitational attraction. He divided the nebulae into eight classes, with classes VI through VIII being used to classify clusters of stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} {{was to have}} been on 8 April 2005, and was to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious service of blessing at St George's Chapel. However, to conduct a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to obtain a licence for civil marriages, which it did not have. A condition of such a licence is that the licensed venue must be available for a period of one year to anyone wishing to be married there, and as the royal family did not wish to make Windsor Castle available to the public for civil marriages, <b>even</b> <b>just</b> for one year, the venue was changed to the town hall at Windsor Guildhall. On 4 April, it was announced that the marriage would be delayed by one day to allow the Prince of Wales and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or <b>even</b> <b>just</b> by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E
