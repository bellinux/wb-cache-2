5|$|The 1911–12 season started {{strongly}} for Macartney. He scored 122 {{and took}} 5/81 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings. However, the season went downhill from there; Macartney {{failed to pass}} 30 in the next ten innings and took only three wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> matches. As a result, he was {{left out of the}} playing XI and made twelfth man for the first three Tests against the touring England team.|$|E

5|$|The Irvine–Lochhead {{partnership}} {{continued into}} the 1965–66 campaign. Irvine scored a goal in a 2–1 win against Lausanne Sports on a pre-season tour of Switzerland, and his first competitive goal of the season came on 24 August 1965 in the 3–1 home victory against Blackpool. He scored two in the return match at Bloomfield Road the following week, and two matches later he netted a hat-trick in the 4–1 defeat of Northampton Town. Between the 1–1 draw away at Leeds United on 30 October 1965 and the 5–2 win against Fulham on 11 December 1965, Irvine scored in seven consecutive league matches. In the 3–1 win against West Ham United, Irvine and Lochhead both scored in the same match for the first time, despite having played together for almost three seasons. Irvine took his goalscoring form into the cup competitions, netting five times in three FA Cup ties, and scoring the winning goals against Southampton and Stoke City as the team reached the fifth round of the Football League Cup before being knocked out by Peterborough United. During {{the second half of}} the season, he went through a somewhat barren spell, failing to score in the league between 8 January 1966 and 26 March 1966. He ended his poor run of form with a hat-trick in the 4–1 win over Nottingham Forest at Turf Moor. He subsequently got on the scoresheet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> league games, including two goals against Sheffield Wednesday which took him to 27 league goals, the joint-highest total since George Beel's 30 in the 1928–29 season. Irvine's 29th and final goal of the season came on 23 April 1966 in the 2–0 home victory against Liverpool. He was the highest scorer in the Football League First Division that season, the first, and to date only, time a Burnley player had achieved the feat.|$|E

25|$|Following the Civil War, in February 1866 the Maryland {{legislature}} assumed half {{ownership of}} the school. The college thus became in part a state institution.

25|$|The Mersey Railway was a {{passenger}} railway that connected {{the communities of}} Liverpool and Birkenhead, England, which lie on opposite banks of the River Mersey, via the Mersey Railway Tunnel from 1886 to 1948.

25|$|After the 2010 UK general {{election}} in May 2010, the coalition Conservative/Liberal Democrat alliance placed all major government capital expenditure, including the Great Western electrification scheme on hold pending a return-on-investment review.

The Tigers were undefeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> years. Matthews led the Tigers to unbeaten seasons in 1956 and 1957, and left the school with a 33-game winning streak. His 1957 team won the schools second mythical national championship.|$|R

25|$|The club's {{financial}} problems would soon {{come to light}} again.

Back on the field, the club had mixed results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> league games. Three wins, a draw, and two defeats which included a disappointing 2–1 loss away to Donegal Celtic, left the Glens sitting in fifth place in the league at the end of November, twelve points behind pacesetters Cliftonville.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{activities}} defined under PRONUREE is the national program to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2011 in Argentina. The program, financed by the government, aims to replace incandescent bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in all households connected to the electricity grid and selected public buildings. The program, which has initially undergone a pilot phase and expects to replace 5 million incandescent lamps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall. Staff from the distribution companies will visit each household to replace the incandescent lamps and to inform residential users on the advantages of replacing the bulbs and of the efficient use of energy in general.|$|E

25|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, Nice {{struggled to}} equal {{the success of}} the 1950s with Reims and, later Saint-Étienne eclipsing the club in the 1960s and '70s. During this time, Nice regularly competed in Division 1 with the exception of two seasons in Division 2 in 1965 and 1970. In 1973 and 1976, Nice achieved a second-place finish in the league, its best finish since winning the league in 1959. Following the latter finish, however, the club finished in lower positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> seasons and were, ultimately, relegated in the 1981–82 season after finishing 19th. Nice played three seasons in the second division before returning to top flight in 1985. After six seasons a mid-table finishes, Nice was back in Division 2.|$|E

25|$|Following the Civil War, the Maryland {{legislature}} {{pulled the}} college out of bankruptcy, and in February 1866 assumed half {{ownership of the}} school.

Twenty years later, the school's reputation as a research institution began, as the federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established there.

25|$|In 227, Zhuge Liang {{transferred}} {{his main}} Shu armies to Hanzhong, {{and opened up}} {{the battle for the}} northwest with Wei.

The Shu forces began to withdraw; Sima Yi deduced Zhuge Liang's demise and ordered an attack. Shu struck back almost immediately, causing Sima Yi to second guess and allow Shu to withdraw successfully.|$|E
