50|$|The typical 500 volts {{between the}} {{backside}} of the last MCP and the anode cannot be fed into the preamplifier. Therefore, the inner or the outer conductor needs a DC-block, that is, a capacitor. Often it is chosen to only have 10-fold capacitance compared to the MCP-anode capacitance and is implemented as a plate capacitor. Rounded, <b>electro-polished</b> metal plates and the ultra high vacuum allow very high field strengths and high capacitance without a dielectric. The bias for the center conductor is applied via resistors hanging through the waveguide (see bias tee). If the DC block {{is used in the}} outer conductor, it is in parallel with the larger capacitor in the power supply. Assuming good screening, the only noise is due to current noise from the linear power regulator. Because the current is low in this application and space for large capacitors is available, and because the DC-block capacitor is fast, it is possible to have very low voltage noise, so that even weak MCP signals can be detected. Sometimes the preamplifier is on a potential (off ground) and gets its power through a low-power isolation transformer and outputs its signal optically.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we {{presented}} an efficient route to prepare ultra-smooth substrates by first annealing and then <b>electro-polishing</b> commercial copper, {{which is more}} effective in achieving a smooth surface than just annealing or <b>electro-polishing</b> alone. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} thermal annealing can release the residue internal strain and dislocation, thus the smooth surface achieved by <b>electro-polishing</b> can be preserved at elevated temperatures for graphene growth. The efficiency of the smooth surface prepared in this way was demonstrated by the reduction of graphene domain density, adlayer density, defect density, and the improvement of electrical transport performance.|$|R

30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{that there is a}} close correlation between substrate morphology and graphene nucleation sites [12 – 14]. CVD growth of graphene is typically performed on commercial polycrystalline Cu foils. As-received Cu prepared by a cold rolling process often has many defects [12, 15, 16], such as rolling lines, potential strains, impurities, and native oxide, which greatly impact the quality of the graphene. To improve the morphology of copper, a wide variety of pretreatment methods have been investigated, such as annealing [17 – 24], physical polishing [25], etching [15, 26], <b>electro-polishing</b> [13, 27 – 30], liquefying [31], and melting-resolidification [32]. Among them, annealing and <b>electro-polishing</b> are the most widely employed due to increased efficiency and convenience. With the rearranging of Cu surface atoms, releasing internal stress in copper and growing Cu crystal size, annealing has become an indispensable step in graphene growth [21 – 23]. However, limited by the formation of step bunching and evaporation of Cu atoms [23, 33], the surface of annealed Cu remains relatively rough which has a negative influence on graphene growth. <b>Electro-polishing</b> treatments can significantly improve the surface morphology of the substrate, which is critical to obtain homogenous graphene films as well as avoiding graphene adlayer formation [27, 34]. However, the defects of Cu such as etching pits and spike points are still hard to avoid by traditional <b>electro-polishing</b> techniques [28, 29]. Therefore, techniques to prepare ultra-smooth metallic substrates need to be investigated and improved upon.|$|R

40|$|Fabricating {{small and}} smart devices from {{multifunctional}} materials requires the controlled preparation of surfaces. The effect of using <b>electro-polishing</b> solutions to improve surface finish and remove defects {{present at the}} surface on shape memory alloys, such as Ni-Ti, have been thoroughly characterized in the scientific literature. In contrast, the effectiveness of {{only a small number}} of <b>electro-polishing</b> solutions on magnetic shape memory alloys, such as Ni 2 MnGa, have been systematically evaluated. Thus, predicting the mass removal rate for Ni 2 MnGa, given a set of polishing parameters, is often inaccurate, causing a deleterious effect on the precision of sample preparation. This study seeks to evaluate the performance of an <b>electro-polishing</b> solution composed of sulfuric and phosphoric acid by measuring the surface finish, mass removal rate and number of defects removed by varying the current density, bath chemistry and bath temperature.

30|$|In this work, we {{combined}} annealing and electro-polishing {{together for}} the preparation of smooth Cu substrates. Although electro-polishing is an efficient method to make smooth surfaces, graphene growth is normally conducted at high temperatures which may release the internal strain and move dislocations to the surface. This could cause the Cu surface to be roughened again. Here, we annealed the Cu substrate before electro-polishing to release the residue strain and defects. In this way, the surface reconstruction due to strain release when growing graphene at high temperatures was significantly restricted and the <b>electro-polished</b> surface could be maintained. We demonstrated that the domain density of graphene grown on such Cu substrates is greatly reduced compared to those on just an annealed or an <b>electro-polished</b> Cu substrate. Our method to prepare smooth substrates benefits the synthesis of not only graphene but also other thin-film or two-dimensional materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{initiation}} of {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) was studied using scanning electron microscope observations of linearly increasing stress test specimens. SCC initiation from the following surfaces was studied: (i) initiation from the commercial pipe surface covered by the Zn coating, (ii) initiation from a mechanically polished surface with a deformed layer, and (iii) initiation from an <b>electro-polished</b> surface. SCC initiation involved different features for these surfaces as follows. (i) For the Zn coated commercial pipe surface, {{a crack in the}} Zn coating led to the dissolution of the deformed layer and when the deformed layer was penetrated, intergranular SCC initiation became possible. (ii) For a mechanically polished surface with a deformed layer, cracks in the surface oxide concentrated the anodic dissolution {{to such an extent that}} there was transgranular SCC in the deformed layer. SCC was intergranular when the deformed layer had been penetrated. Transgranular stress corrosion cracks were stopped at ferrite grain boundaries (GBs) oriented perpendicular to the SCC propagation direction. (iii) For an <b>electro-polished</b> surface, the surface oxide film was cracked at many locations, but intergranular SCC only propagated into the steel when the oxide crack corresponded to a GB. An oxide crack away from a GB is expected to be healed. The observed SCC initiation mechanism was not associated with simple preferential chemical attack of the ferrite GBs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the residual stress relaxation {{and its effect on}} the fatigue strength of AISI 316 L steel ground surfaces in comparison to <b>electro-polished</b> surfaces. An experimental evaluation was performed using 3 -point and 4 -point bending fatigue tests at Rr = 0. 1 on two sets of notched spec-imens ﬁnished by electro-polishing and grinding. The residual stress ﬁelds were measured at the notch root of specimens, before and after fatigue tests, by means of the X-ray diffraction technique. It was found a degradation of about 35 % for the 4 -point bending fatigue limit at 2 106 cycles of the ground spec-imens in comparison to the <b>electro-polished</b> ones. This degradation is associated with a slight relaxation of the grinding residual stresses which remain signiﬁcant tensile stresses at the stabilized state. While under the 3 -point bending test, these residual stresses relax completely and provoke a noticeable increase of the fatigue limit estimated at about 50 % in comparison to the 4 -point bending fatigue test. The numerical evaluation of residual stress relaxation was carried out by FE analyses of the cyclic hard-ening behaviour of the ground layer. The isotropic and nonlinear kinematic model proposed by Chaboche was used and calibrated for the base material and the ground layer. The results show that residual stres-ses relax to a stabilized state characterized by elastic-shakedown response. This stabilization is occurred after the ﬁrst cycle of the 4 -point bending test corresponding to the higher stress concentration (Kt- 4 p = 1. 66), while it requires many cycles under the 3 -point bending test corresponding to the lower stress concentration (Kt- 3 p = 1. 54).
