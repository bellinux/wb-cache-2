40|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuels {{releases}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere, and {{has led to an}} increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO 2. CO 2 is a greenhouse gas, and the increase in concentration leads to an increase in global temperatures and global climatic change. Fossil-fuel consumption, along with cement production, is responsible for 80 % of anthropogenic carbon emissions and consumption {{of fossil fuels}} continues to increase. Despite its importance to the global climate and the global carbon cycle, data for fossil fuel CO 2 emissions are traditionally maintained only on national levels and annual time steps. A method is developed to improve the spatiotemporal resolution to the leading energy consuming countries of the world. The method uses energy consumption datasets as well as other ancillary datasets to apportion national annual emissions totals into sub-national and monthly emissions datasets by <b>fuel</b> <b>type.</b> Emissions <b>patterns</b> are highly variable both temporally and spatially by <b>fuel</b> <b>type,</b> and detailed information on the distribution of emissions improves our understanding of the global carbon cycle and leads to better understanding of the spatial and seasonal distribution of the drivers o...|$|R

Experimental results by analyzing two conventional jet fuels (Jet-A and JP- 8) and a synthetic jet fuel (S- 8) are presented and compared. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry is used to qualify the components of each fuel. Several batches of S- 8 from two sources, NASA and AFRL, are analyzed and compared. Strong similarities between the batches are observed, although key differences indicate they are not from the same batch. Results of S- 8 fuel analysis are further compared to those obtained by NIST.

40|$|Fast Reactor <b>Fuel</b> <b>Type</b> and Reactor Safety Performance R. Wigeland, Idaho National Laboratory J. Cahalan, Argonne National Laboratory The {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast neutron}} reactor is currently being evaluated for the efficient transmutation of the highly-hazardous, long-lived, transuranic elements that are present in spent nuclear fuel. One of the fundamental choices that will be made is {{the selection of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> for the fast reactor, whether oxide, metal, carbide, nitride, etc. It is likely that a decision on the <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> will need to be made before many of the related technologies and facilities can be selected, from fuel fabrication to spent fuel reprocessing. A decision on <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> should consider all impacts on the fast reactor system, including safety. Past work has demonstrated that the choice of <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> may {{have a significant impact on}} the severity of consequences arising from accidents, especially for severe accidents of low probability. In this paper, the response of sodium-cooled fast reactors is discussed for both oxide and metal <b>fuel</b> <b>types,</b> highlighting the similarities and differences in reactor response and accident consequences. Any fast reactor facility must be designed to be able to successfully prevent, mitigate, or accommodate all consequences of potential events, including accidents. This is typically accomplished by using multiple barriers to the release of radiation, including the cladding on the fuel, the intact primary cooling system, and most visibly the reactor containment building. More recently, this has also included the use of ‘inherent safety’ concepts to reduce or eliminate the potential for serious damage in some cases. Past experience with oxide and metal fuel has demonstrated that both <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> are suitable for use as fuel in a sodium-cooled fast reactor. However, safety analyses for these two <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> have also shown that there can be substantial differences in accident consequences due to the neutronic and thermophysical properties of the fuel and their compatibility with the reactor coolant, with corresponding differences in the challenges presented to the reactor developers. Accident phenomena are discussed for the sodium-cooled fast reactor based on the mechanistic progression of conditions from accident initiation to accident termination, whether a benign state is achieved or more severe consequences are expected. General principles connecting accident phenomena and fuel properties are developed from the oxide and metal fuel safety analyses, providing guidelines that can be used as part of the evaluation for selection of <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> for the sodium-cooled fast reactor...|$|R

In the present study, forest fuel mapping is considered from a remote sensing perspective. The purpose is to delineate forest types by exploring the use of coarse resolution satellite remote sensing MODIS imagery. In order to ascertain how well MODIS data can provide an exhaustive classification of fuel properties a sample area characterized by mixed vegetation covers and complex topography was analysed. The study area is located in the South of Italy. Fieldwork <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> recognitions, performed before, after and during the acquisition of remote sensing MODIS data, were used as ground-truth dataset to assess the obtained results. The method comprised the following three steps: (I) adaptation of Prometheus <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> for obtaining a standardization system useful for remotely sensed classification of <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> and properties in the considered Mediterranean ecosystems; (II) model construction for the spectral characterization and mapping of <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> based on two different approach, maximum likelihood (ML) classification algorithm and spectral Mixture Analysis (MTMF); (III) accuracy assessment for the performance evaluation based on the comparison of MODIS-based results with ground-truth.

Accurate knowledge of forest fuel extent and properties {{can be an effective}} component for assessing the impacts of possible future wildfires on ecosystem services. Our study aims to evaluate and compare the spectral and spatial information inherent in the EO- 1 Hyperion, Quickbird and Landsat TM imagery. The analysis was based on a support vector machine classification approach in order to discriminate and map Mediterranean <b>fuel</b> <b>types.</b> The <b>fuel</b> classification scheme followed a site-specific fuel model within the study area, which is suitable for fire behavior prediction and spatial simulation. The overall accuracy of the Quickbird-based <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> mapping was higher than 74 % with a quantity disagreement of 9 % and an allocation disagreement of 17 %. Both classifications from the Hyperion and Landsat TM <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> maps presented approximately 70 % overall accuracy and 16 % allocation disagreement.

This research aims to assess the viability of combining Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and the fusion of a WorldView- 2 (WV 2) image and low density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in order to produce <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> maps within an area of complex orography and vegetation distribution located in the island of Tenerife (Spain). Independent GEOBIAs were applied to four datasets to create four <b>fuel</b> <b>type</b> maps according to the Prometheus classification. The following fusion methods were compared: Image Stack (IS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), as well as the WV 2 image alone. Accuracy assessment of the maps was conducted by comparison against the <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> assessed in the field. Besides global agreement, disagreement measures due to allocation and quantity were estimated, both globally and by <b>fuel</b> <b>type.</b> This made it possible to better understand the nature of disagreements linked to each map. The global agreement of the obtained maps varied from 76. 23 % to 85. 43 %. Maps obtained through data fusion reached a significantly higher global agreement than the map derived from the WV 2 image alone. By integrating LiDAR information with the GEOBIAs, global agreement improvements by over 10 % were attained in all cases. No significant differences in global agreement were found among the three classifications performed on WV 2 and LiDAR fusion data (IS, PCA, MNF).

Four {{classification}} algorithms {{have been}} assessed and compared with mapped forest <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> from Terra-ASTER sensor images in a representative area of Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain).

The BEHAVE <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> of the reference dataset were first converted into the Fire Behaviour <b>Fuel</b> <b>Types</b> described by Scott and Burgan, {{taking into account the}} vegetation of the study area. Then, three pixel-based algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine) and an Object-Based Image Analysis were applied to classify the Scott and Burgan fire behaviour <b>fuel</b> <b>types</b> from an ASTER image from 3 March 2003. The performance of the algorithms tested was assessed and compared in terms of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. Within the pixel-based classifications, the best results were obtained from the Support Vector Machine algorithm, which showed an overall accuracy of 83 %; 14 % of disagreement was due to allocation and 3 % to quantity disagreement. The Object-Based Image Analysis approach produced the most accurate maps, with an overall accuracy of 95 %; 4 % disagreement was due to allocation and 1 % to quantity disagreement. The object-based classification achieved thus an overall accuracy of 12 % above the best results obtained for the pixel-based algorithms tested.
