Improvement of methodologies that allow for the assessment of epigenetic regulation have contributed enormously to the understanding of GH action, but many questions still remain to be clarified. The reversible nature of epigenetic factors and, particularly, their role as mediators between the genome and the environment, make them viable therapeutic target candidates. Rather than reviewing the molecular and epigenetic pathways regulated by GH action, in this review we have focused on the use of epigenetic modulators as potential drugs to improve the GH response. We first discuss recent progress in the understanding of intracellular molecular mechanisms controlling GH and IGF-I action. We then emphasize current advances in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that control gene expression, and which support a key role for epigenetic regulation in the cascade of intracellular events that trigger GH action when coupled to its receptor. Thirdly, we focus on fetal programming and epigenetic regulation at the IGF 1 locus. We then discuss epigenetic alterations in intrauterine growth retardation, and the possibility for a potential epigenetic pharmaceutical approach in short stature associated with this fetal condition. Lastly, we review an example of epigenetic therapeutics in the context of growth-related epigenetic deregulation disorders. The advance of our understanding of epigenetic changes and the impact they are having on new forms of therapy creates exciting prospects for the future...|$|R

High levels of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I have been detected in the cerebellum during development and adulthood suggesting a specific role for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I in this brain area. While there is ever increasing data regarding the cell types containing endogenous <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I in the rat brain, no information on the human brain is yet available. In the present study we sought to analyse the precise location of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I peptide in the adult human cerebellum using a specific antiserum against recombinant human <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I. After immunocytochemistry, numerous Purkinje cells exhibited intense positive staining occupying the cell soma, dendrites and dendritic spines as well as axons. Occasionally, immunoreactive Purkinje cell axons were arciform and exhibited bulbous dilatations along their proximal length. Putative recurrent collaterals of Purkinje cell axons were also <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I reactive. Double- staining immunocytochemistry in the same sections consistently showed, as expected, co-expression of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I and calbindin, although a few calbindin containing Purkinje cells lacked <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I immunostaining suggesting there are <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I positive Purkinje cell subsets in the human cerebellum.

In order to better understand the local factors that regulate equine physiology, such as muscle metabolism and reproduction (e. g., germ cell development and fertilisation), real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays for quantification of equine <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor and insulin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid were developed. The assays were sensitive: 192 copies/µLand 891 copies/µL for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor, messenger ribonucleic acid and insulin receptor respectively (95 %limit of detection), and efficient: 1. 01 for the <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor assay and 0. 95 for the insulin receptor assay. The assays had a broad linear range of detection (seven logs for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor and six logs for insulin receptor).

Low concentrations of both <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor and insulin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid were detected in endometrium, lung and spleen samples, whilst high concentrations were detected in heart, muscle and kidney samples, this was most likely due to the high level of glucose metabolism and glucose utilisation by these tissues.

40|$|Several {{findings}} indicate {{that there is a}} close interaction between estrogen and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I in different brain regions. In adult brain, both estrogen and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I have co-ordinated effects in the regulation of neuroendocrine events, synaptic plasticity and neural response to injury. In this study we have qualitatively assessed whether estrogen receptors and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor are colocalized in the same cells in the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of female rat brain using confocal microscopy. Immunoreactivity for estrogen receptors α and β was colocalized with immunoreactivity for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor in many neurons from the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, estrogen receptor β and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor immunoreactivities were colocalized in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Colocalization of estrogen receptor β and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor was also detected in cells with the morphology of astrocytes in all regions assessed. The co-expression of estrogen receptors and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor in the same neurons may allow a cross-coupling of their signaling pathways. Furthermore, the colocalization of immunoreactivity for estrogen receptor β and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I receptor in glial cells suggests that glia may also {{play a role in the}} interactions of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I and estrogen in the rat brain.

AIM: To evaluate {{the involvement of the}} <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 system and estrogen receptors in bile salts modulation of apoptosis/proliferation of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and cholangiocytes were exposed to glycochenodeoxycholate or tauro-CDC in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor blocking antibody (alphaIR 3), small interfering RNA for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1, 17 beta-estradiol or estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182, 780). Proliferation was evaluated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen Western blot and apoptosis by measuring caspase- 3 activity or annexin-V. RESULTS: In hepatocytes, the <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor blocker enhanced glycochenodeoxycholate-induced apoptosis and caused tauro-CDC to promote apoptosis. 17 Beta-estradiol or the estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182, 780) did not influence the apoptotic effect of glycochenodeoxycholate. In cholangiocytes, both glycochenodeoxycholate and tauro-CDC induced proliferation at 100 microM, while they induced apoptosis at 1 mM with a more pronounced effect of glycochenodeoxycholate. Apoptosis induced by 1 mM glycochenodeoxycholate or tauro-CDC in cholangiocytes was enhanced by blocking <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 receptor or by silencing <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1. 17 Beta-estradiol counteracts glycochenodeoxycholate-induced cholangiocyte apoptosis by enhancing <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 secretion and activating the <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 system.

To evaluate {{the role of the}} hepatic growth hormone receptor in the decreased serum concentrations of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I, serum levels of the high affinity growth hormone-binding protein, which is qualitatively and quantitatively related to the hepatic growth hormone receptor, and of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I were measured in 70 children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and 105 healthy control children. Analysis of variance revealed a significant negative effect of Type 1 diabetes on serum levels of the growth hormone-binding protein and of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I. In the diabetic patients, serum levels of the growth hormone-binding protein were positively related to body mass index and to insulin dose per kg body weight, and were not influenced by pubertal stage, gender, or plasma levels of haemoglobin A 1 c.

Although {{it has been suggested}} that <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I is involved in a variety of cellular responses leading to homeostasis, mechanisms involved in its possible trophic effects are largely unknown. Since activation of c-Fos in postmitotic neurons takes place both in response to <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I and after brain injury, we have investigated whether this early response gene may be involved in the actions of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I after brain insult. Partial deafferentation of the cerebellar cortex by 3 -acetylpyridine injection elicited c-Fos protein expression on both Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellar cortex. This neurotoxic insult also triggered gliosis, as determined by an increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells (reactive astrocytes) in the cerebellar cortex.

We injected an <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I antisense in the inferior olive of adult rats, a procedure which we previously found to elicit a significant and reversible decrease of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> I levels in the contralateral cerebellum.

The decrease in spine size was linked to a diminished numerical density of dendritic spines on Purkinje cells, without affecting the numerical density of synapses in the molecular layer of the cerebellum.

STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred thirty-eight cord serum samples were analyzed for <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I, <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-II, C-peptide, and <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- 1 by immunoassay. Samples included all gestational ages in the third trimester and a large range of birth weights. RESULTS: Cord serum <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I concentrations increased until 39 weeks (+ 84 % from 28 to 29 weeks), followed by a 21 % decline at 41 weeks. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I levels were decreased by 40 % in small-for-gestational-age (90 th percentile) newborns in the absence of diabetes. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I levels were best correlated with birth weight (R = 0. 48, p < 0. 001). Cord serum <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-II concentrations were sixfold to tenfold higher than those of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> factor-I and were 8 % to 10 % (p < 0. 001) higher in large-for-gestational-age than in average-weight and small-for-gestational-age newborns. Cord serum C-peptide concentrations were 28 % and 34 % higher in large-for-gestational-age than in average-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age newborns, respectively. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- 1 levels were increased in preterm average-for-gestational-age and in term small-for-gestational-age newborns compared with term average-for-gestational-age newborns and showed a negative correlation with birth weight (R = - 0. 43, n = 131, p < 0. 001). <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> binding protein- 1 was not correlated with C-peptide concentrations.

We have therefore examined the effect of <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 on neuronal cell death and motor function after spinal cord ischemia. Methods: Japanese white rabbits were subjected to spinal cord ischemia by clamping the abdominal aorta for 15 minutes. <b>Insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (0. 3 mg/kg) at a dose equipotent to insulin (0. 3 IU/kg) in lowering blood glucose level or the control (phosphate-buffered saline solution as a vehicle) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before the aortic clamp. Results: Hind-limb motor function had recovered normally 48 hours after the operation in all the rabbits (n = 8) treated with <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1. In contrast, all the control-treated (n = 8) and all but one of the insulin-treated (n = 6) rabbits had deteriorated to paraplegia by 48 hours after the operation. Histopathologic sections in the involved spinal cord segment showed that a significantly (P <. 0001) greater number of motor neuron cells were preserved in the rabbits treated with <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (17. 9 ± 4. 8 per section) than in those treated with the control (8. 0 ± 2. 1). Although insulin was equipotent to <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 in preserving the number of motor neuron cells (18. 5 ± 2. 7), the percentage of motor neuron cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling were significantly (P <. 01) smaller in the rabbits treated with <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (6. 0 ± 4. 6) compared with those treated with the control (54. 6 ± 33. 8) and insulin (26. 2 ± 11. 7). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that <b>insulin-like</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 increased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein and inhibited expression of the proapoptotic Bax protein in motor neuron cells 24 and 48 hours after the operation.
