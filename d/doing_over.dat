About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you <b>doing</b> <b>over</b> here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything.
