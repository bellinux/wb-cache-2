40|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature, T(g), of a binary mixture commonly varies monotonically between the T(g) s {{of its two}} components. However, mixtures of strongly associating liquids can instead exhibit a nonmonotonic T(g) variation. The origins of such nonideal mixing behavior have often been correlated with composition dependent structural variations. For binary mixtures between a hydrogen- (H-) bonded liquid and water, however, such behavior is generally not well understood. The ubiquity and importance of aqueous mixtures both in nature and in man-made applications stresses the needed for a better understanding. We here demonstrate nonmonotonic T(g) variations in binary mixtures of n-propylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (nPGMEs) and water, where the composition dependent T(g) show maxima within an intermediate composition range. We show that these T(g) maxima correspond to crossovers in the composition dependence of the step amplitude in the isobaric heat capacity at T(g). We further demonstrate that the observed effects are caused by H-bond interactions involving the nPGME hydroxyl group. We can account for our obervations using a simple model based on two effects due to the added water: (i) an H-bond induced formation of effective relaxing entities and (ii) a plasticizing effect at high water contents...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} has been studied for solution-phase oligosaccharide syntheses using low molecular weight poly(ethylene <b>glycol)</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (MPEG, average Mn = 550 and 750) as oligomer supports. A complex branched mannononaose (Man 9) has been synthesized by this method in a very concise way to yield a large quantity of final product. Attempt has been made towards the synthesis of a heptasaccharide phytoalexin elicitor (HPE). Model linear mannotetraose and branched mannopentaose were first tested using the novel HMB low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) linker. The use of this linker as the oligomer support retains the normal advantages of polymer-supported solution synthesis of oligosaccharides. Purification of the supported synthons by flash column chromatography on silica gel is greatly simplified. Another advantage {{of this approach is}} that the reaction can be monitored readily by the usual arsenal of spectroscopic techniques. Both compounds were obtained in over 10 % overall yields. In order to synthesize properly protected glycosyl donors for the construction of the mannononaose, the regioselective reductive ring opening of benzylidene acetals in carbohydrates with BH 3 /Bu 2 BOTf and regioselective acylation of hexopyranosides with pivaloyl chloride have been developed. BH 3 /Bu 2 OTf is an effective reagent to reductively cleave 4, 6 - O-benzylidene acetals of various hexopyranosides to the corresponding 4 -O-benzyl ethers. 4, 6 -O-isopropylidene acetals can be similarly cleaved. Common protecting groups are stable to the reaction conditions. On the other hand, the regioselectivity in the acylation of hexopyranosides with pivaloyl chloride in pyridine was studied. Manno- and galacto-pyranosides were regioselectively acylated to give the 3 - O-pivaloylated compounds in good yields. Both methodologies have been used to provide properly protected mannoside donors and acceptors for polymannan syntheses. The regioselective reductive ring opening of 4, 6 - O-benzylidene acetals of hexopyranosides has also been demonstrated by concise syntheses of two building blocks of a heptasaccharide phytoalexin elicitor (HPE). A concise synthesis of the mannan residue of a highly branched mannose type oligosaccharide present on the viral coat of HIV- 1 from only two monosaccharide building blocks was achieved. The synthesis requires only five coupling steps instead of the seven or more steps required for the conventional block synthesis. In addition, even though the synthesis of HPE has not been completed to the last step, it showed that adjustment of the length of the poly(ethylene glycol) oligomer support could result in better overall yields. In both cases, 1 H- 1 H COSY and 1 H- 13 C HMQC NMR spectroscopies have proven to be extremely useful in monitoring the progress of oligosaccharide construction. These syntheses demonstrate that oligomer-supported solution synthesis using low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) is a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient preparation of complex oligosaccharides...|$|R

In conducting enzymatic polymerization of substituted phenols, the sparingly soluble nature of the monomers in water must be considered. Chain growth in an entirely aqueous medium is not feasible because the even lower solubility of dimmers, trimers and tetramers cause phase separation and precipitation.

Furthermore, the optimal concentration of oxidant is 0. 15 M. The change of the molecular weight of polymer with varying the water content was found {{to be related to the}} molecular clustering in the solution, observed through the difference HPLC for clusters. 本研究利用mPEG（polyethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> ethers，MW 5000 ）修飾辣根過氧化氫酶(Horseradish Peroxidase,HRP) ，討論修飾酵素在有機溶劑中的催化活性，並利用修飾後的HRP（mPEG-HRP）催化 2 -naphthol與氧化劑（H 2 O 2 ）進行氧化聚合反應，形成poly(2 -naphthol) ，探討單體轉化率與反應時間、氧化劑添加量、溶劑組成之關係。運用UV-Vis光譜及螢光光譜分析poly(2 -naphthol) 之形成，高效能液相層析儀分析單體轉化率與分離純化高分子產物。化學修飾後HRP可溶解於Acetonitrile及Toluene中，並具有催化活性。mPEG-HRP溶於 Acetonitrile的活性與未修飾之HRP比較，在 25 ℃時高出 35 倍，溫度提升至 100 ℃，活性仍然高出 6 倍。以過氧化氫為氧化劑，利用修飾酵素（mPEG-HRP）催化單體 2 -naphthol進行聚合反應，其反應十分快速，利用單體的疏水特性進行沉澱分離，當聚合物之聚合度增加時疏水性亦增加，故選用HPLC進行分析。而聚合反應中添加過量氧化劑則會抑制酵素活性，改變反應溶劑組成則影響聚合物之分子量。中文摘要	 i Abstract	ii 第一章 緒論	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 2 - 1 	酵素 	 3 2 - 2 	酵素應用於有機相反應	 5 2 - 3 	酵素於有機相失活之機制	 8 2 - 4 	增加酵素於有機相反應活性的方法	 11 2 - 4 - 1 	逆微胞法(Reverse micelles) 	 11 2 - 4 - 2 	界面活性劑包覆法(Surfactant-coated-enzyme) 	 13 2 - 4 - 3 	鹽類添加法	 14 2 - 4 - 4 	化學修飾法(Chemical modification) 	 16 2 - 5 	研究系統	 18 2 - 5 - 1 	聚乙二醇 poly(ethylene glycol) 	 18 2 - 5 - 2 	Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) 	 21 第三章 實驗儀器與藥品	 25 3 - 1 實驗儀器	 25 3 - 2 實驗藥品	 26 第四章 實驗方法	 28 4 - 1 	甲基聚乙二醇活化反應	 28 4 - 2 	Horseradish Peroxidase修飾反應	 28 4 - 2 - 1 	修飾劑添加量的影響	 28 4 - 2 - 2 	反應時間的影響	 28 4 - 2 - 3 	緩衝液反應系統的探討	 29 4 - 3 	修飾後Horseradish Peroxidase的分離與純化	 29 4 - 4 	化學修飾辣根過氧化氫酶(HRP) 性質分析	 30 4 - 4 - 1 	酵素於甲苯(Toluene) 之活性分析	 30 4 - 4 - 2 	酵素於乙氰(Aectonitrile) 之活性分析	 30 4 - 4 - 3 	酵素濃度分析	 30 4 - 4 - 4 	酵素修飾程度分析：蛋白質電泳(SDS-PAGE) 	 31 4 - 5 2 -萘酚聚合反應(2 -naphthal polymerization) 	 34 4 - 5 - 1 	反應時間對單體轉化率之影響	 34 4 - 5 - 2 	氧化劑濃度對單體轉化率的影響	 34 4 - 5 - 3 	溶劑系統對單體轉化率的影響	 34 4 - 6 單體 2 -萘酚轉化率之分析	 35 4 - 7 聚(2 -萘酚) 分析方法	 35 4 - 7 - 1 	Poly[2 -naphthol] 螢光分析	 35 4 - 7 - 2 	Poly[2 -naphthol] 紫外光分析	 36 4 - 8 聚(2 -萘酚) 之純化分離	 36 第五章 結果與討論	 37 5 - 1 甲基聚乙二醇活化反應	 37 5 - 2 Horseradish Peroxidase修飾反應	 38 5 - 2 - 1 緩衝液系統對修飾反應的探討	 40 	 5 - 2 - 1 - 1 修飾劑添加量	 40 	 5 - 2 - 1 - 2 反應時間	 42 	 5 - 2 - 1 - 3 緩衝液修飾系統與pH值	 45 5 - 3 化學修飾辣根過氧化氫酶之分離與純化	 47 5 - 4 化學修飾HRP之性質探討	 49 5 - 5 2 -萘酚之聚合反應	 51 5 - 5 - 1 	聚(2 -萘酚) 之分析	 53 5 - 5 - 2 2 -萘酚單體轉化率之探討	 58 	 5 - 5 - 2 - 1 反應時間	 61 	 5 - 5 - 2 - 2 氧化劑添加量	 66 	 5 - 5 - 2 - 3 溶劑系統	 68 5 - 5 - 3 溶劑系統對聚合反應之探討	 70 5 - 5 - 4 聚(2 -萘酚) 之純化分離	 74 第六章 結論	 82 第七章 參考文獻	 84 圖表目錄 圖 2 - 1 蛋白質在有機-水溶液中之失活示意圖	 10 圖 2 - 2 逆微胞示意圖	 12 圖 2 - 3 支鏈型PEG與直鏈型之比較示意圖	 20 圖 2 - 4 HRP的催化機制	 23 圖 2 - 5 peroxidases的compoundⅠ之形成	 23 圖 5 - 1 改變pNPC-mPEG添加量對修飾反應之影響	 41 圖 5 - 2 添加少量pNPC-mPEG改變反應時間對修飾反應之影響	 43 圖 5 - 3 改變反應時間對修飾反應之影響	 44 圖 5 - 4 改變緩衝溶液與pH值對修飾反應之影響	 46 圖 5 - 5 酵素於有機溶劑（Acetonitrile、Toluene）之活性分析	 50 圖 5 - 6 藉由酵素氧化 2 -naphthol轉移一個電子後的各種自由基共振結構	 52 圖 5 - 7 不同溶劑中合成之Poly(2 -naphthol) UV-Vis吸收光譜	 55 圖 5 - 8 不同溶劑中合成之Poly(2 -naphthol) 螢光分析光譜	 56 圖 5 - 9 不同溶劑中合成之Poly(2 -naphthol) 螢光分析光譜	 57 圖 5 - 10 單體 2 -naphthol反應 0 min、 1 min、 2 min之層析圖	 59 圖 5 - 11 單體 2 -naphthol反應 24 小時與控制組之層析圖	 60 圖 5 - 12 反應時間對單體轉化率之影響	 62 圖 5 - 13 於 90 % Dioxane溶液中反應時間對單體轉化率之關係	 63 圖 5 - 14 於 90 % Acetonitrile溶液中反應時間對單體轉化率之關係	 64 圖 5 - 15 在磷酸鈉緩衝液/ 1, 4 -Dioxane中反應時間對單體轉化率之關係	 65 圖 5 - 16 改變起始劑添加量對單體轉化率之影響	 67 圖 5 - 17 改變溶劑組成對單體轉化率之影響	 69 圖 5 - 18 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 90 % Acetonitrile進行聚合反應）	 71 圖 5 - 19 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 90 % 1, 4 -Dioxane進行聚合反應）	 71 圖 5 - 20 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 80 % 1, 4 -Dioxane進行聚合反應）	 72 圖 5 - 21 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 70 % 1, 4 -Dioxane進行聚合反應）	 72 圖 5 - 22 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 60 % 1, 4 -Dioxane進行聚合反應）	 73 圖 5 - 23 高分子HPLC層析圖（於 50 % 1, 4 -Dioxane進行聚合反應）	 73 圖 5 - 24 各收集管（Fraction 1 ~Fraction 18 ）之層析圖	 75 圖 5 - 25 各收集管（Fraction 19 ~Fraction 36 ）之層析圖	 75 圖 5 - 26 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 4 ~Fraction 10 ）	 76 圖 5 - 27 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 11 ~Fraction 17 ）	 76 圖 5 - 28 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 18 ~Fraction 23 ）	 77 圖 5 - 29 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 24 ~Fraction 29 ）	 77 圖 5 - 30 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 30 ~Fraction 36 ）	 78 圖 5 - 31 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 4 ~Fraction 9 ）	 78 圖 5 - 32 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 10 ~Fraction 17 ）	 79 圖 5 - 33 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 18 ~Fraction 24 ）	 79 圖 5 - 34 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 25 ~Fraction 30 ）	 80 圖 5 - 35 各收集管之螢光分析（Fraction 31 ~Fraction 35 ）	 80 表一 SDS-PAGE蛋白質電泳配方	 3...|$|R

After 24 -hour incubation, {{the concentrations of}} 50 percent inhibition (IC 50) of human hematopoietic progenitor cells with MALD or MAA were 3 mM and 3. 9 mM, respectively, and EGME (10 mM or more) did not show any cytotoxicity. IC 50 (after 48 -hour exposure) of MALD and MAA on HL 60 cells were 2. 45 mM and 5. 6 mM, respectively, suggesting that both hematopoietic progenitor cells and HL 60 have a similar sensitivity. DNA ladder formation, a characteristics of apoptosis, was observed in MALD- or MAA-treated HL 60 cells, but not in EGME-treated samples. Caspase- 3 enzyme activity, the effector of the apoptotic process, was greatly enhanced with MALD treatment. The inhibitor of caspase- 3 repressed cell death induced with MALD as well as MAA.

40|$|Eleven commercially {{available}} alcohol and ethylene glycol derivatives were tested for their toxicity toward a problem organism in jet fuel, Cladosporium resinae. In {{the presence of}} glucose, 20 % (vol/vol) ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> prevented spore germination and mycelial growth, and 10 % (vol/vol) 2 -ethoxybutanol, 10 % 2 -isopropoxyethanol, 10 % 3 -methoxybutanol, 5 % 2 -butyloxyethanol, 5 % ethylene glycol dibutyl ether, and 5 % {{diethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} were found to have similar effects. In a biphasic kerosene-water system, 3 -methoxybutanol, 2 -butyloxyethanol, and diethylene glycol monobutyl ether were again found to be more toxic than ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether.</b> Considerable potassium efflux, protein leakage, and inhibition of endogenous respiration were observed {{in the presence of the}} more toxic compounds. 2 -Butyloxyethanol also caused loss of sterols from cells...|$|E

40|$|A methanol-soluble {{fraction}} of the dichloromethane extract from the culture broth of A. alternata AT 4303 strain afforded the following five known mycotoxins: alternariol, alternariol <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether,</b> altenusin, altenuene and altertoxin I. A hexane-soluble {{fraction of}} the dichloromethane extract yielded the steroids ergosterol and ergosterol peroxide, and alternariol <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether.</b> The concentrated ethyl acetate extract afforded the nucleoside uridine, uracil and inosine. The micro-extracts obtained from this strain in solid media were analyzed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), and the following five known toxins were identified: ACTG-C, D, E and F and AK-toxin II. The major toxins produced by the tangerine pathotype ACT-toxins appear to be absent in strain AT 4303. However, the low concentration of ACT-toxins appears {{to be responsible for}} their lack of detection in this study.
