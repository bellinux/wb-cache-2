40|$|We {{propose the}} design of graded index {{metamaterial}} lens using pneumatic actuation for switching between <b>focusing</b> <b>and</b> non <b>focusing</b> states <b>and</b> operating at 9 GHz. Graded refractive index is engineered by using split ring resonators of different widths. Choice of electrical resonators allows planar design and significantly reduced thickness of the lens. Switching between <b>focusing</b> <b>and</b> non <b>focusing</b> states is based on shortening the gaps in split ring resonators with pneumatically actuated metal patches. This leads to {{the disappearance of the}} resonant response of split rings and flattening of phase difference between the elements across the lens. The concept is demonstrated by fabrication and measurement of two versions of the lens representing <b>focusing</b> <b>and</b> non <b>focusing</b> states...|$|R

5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's <b>focus</b> <b>and</b> that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its <b>focus,</b> <b>and</b> dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|At Survivor Series 1993, Owen Hart was {{eliminated}} during a elimination match when he crashed into his brother Bret Hart, who was {{walking along the}} ring apron, causing Owen to lose his <b>focus</b> <b>and</b> be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. He demanded a match with Bret to settle the dispute. Bret refused, and the brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays. They decided to focus their energy on taking the tag team title from the Quebecers. Their plan was temporarily put on hold when Marty Jannetty and the 1-2-3 Kid won the belts, but the Quebecers won a rematch the following week, guaranteeing that the Harts would get their title shot.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational <b>focus</b> <b>and</b> chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart {{was booked}} {{to face his}} brother Owen, with whom {{he was in the}} middle of a feud. The storyline between the Hart {{brothers}} began at Survivor Series 1993, where they were competing on the same side of an elimination match. As Owen was fighting in the ring, Bret, who had sustained a kayfabe injury, was staggering along the ring apron. Owen ran into Bret, causing Owen to lose his <b>focus</b> <b>and</b> get eliminated from the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret. In the following weeks, Owen demanded a match with Bret, but Bret refused to accept the challenge. Eventually, the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret sustained another kayfabe injury, causing the referee to end the match. In a planned turn, Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different <b>focus</b> <b>and</b> perspective to the sector.|$|E

40|$|This thesis uses Q {{methodology}} and an abductive approach to discover competing conceptualisations of how housing associations should be governed and attitudes to board payment. It identifies five sets of perspectives characterised as: 1. Business <b>Focused</b> <b>and</b> Corporately Responsible 2. Socially <b>Focused</b> <b>and</b> Stakeholder Accountable 3. Regulator <b>Focused</b> <b>and</b> Professionally Responsible 4. Leadership <b>Focused</b> <b>and</b> Governance Rigour 5. Pragmatically <b>Focused</b> <b>and</b> Non-Prescriptive The results confirm the hybrid nature of housing associations {{and that their}} governance is complex, multi-faceted so does not converge on one uniform consensus view. Power and payment emerge as two particular issues of contention, but at a more fundamental level the differences relate to conceptions {{of the role of}} the board exists to fulfil. The characteristics of housing association governance are not only analysed at a sector level, but are also explored on a case basis for two housing associations to demonstrate the potential of Q methodology as a means of board assessment. The thesis also considers the significance that the particular context, conditions and circumstances may have from a personal perspective. The thesis concludes that increased recognition should be given to exposing and exploring differences of perspective and ensuring there is clarity about purpose and approach. ...|$|R
