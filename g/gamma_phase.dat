50|$|For cost reasons, the {{existing}} market is divided between alkaline Zn/Fe (99.5%/0.5%) and alkaline Zn/Ni (86%/14%). The use of former alkaline and acidic Zn/Co (99.5%/0.5%) is disappearing from the specifications because Fe gives similar results with less environmental concern. The former Zn/Ni (94%/6%) {{which was a}} blend between pure zinc and the crystallographic <b>gamma</b> <b>phase</b> of Zn/Ni (86%/14%), was withdrawn from the European specifications. A specific advantage of alkaline Zn/Ni (86%/14%) involves the lack of hydrogen embrittlement by plating. It was proved that the first nucleation on steel starts with pure nickel, and that this layer is plated 2 nm thick prior to the Zn-Ni. This initial layer prevents hydrogen from penetrating deep into the steel substrate, thus avoiding the serious problems associated with hydrogen embrittlement. The value of this process and the initiation mechanism is quite useful for high strength steel, tool steels and other substrates susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. A new acidic Zn/Ni (86%/14%) has been developed which produces a brighter deposit but offers less metal distribution than the alkaline system, and without the aforementioned nickel underlayer, does not offer the same performance in terms of hydrogen embrittlement.Additionally, all the zinc alloys receive the new CrVI free conversion coating films which are frequently followed by a top-coat to enhance corrosion protection, wear resistance and to control the coefficient of friction.|$|E

40|$|Gamma-band {{synchronization}} {{adjusts the}} timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a neuron. Neurons in the visual cortex are selective for stimulus orientation because of dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs.
