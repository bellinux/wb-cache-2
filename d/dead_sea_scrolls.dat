5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references to Adam, Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Scrolls,</b> the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of Life, among many others. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{fifteen years}} after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, {{teenager}} Shinji Ikari is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Scrolls.</b> Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer Misato Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.|$|E
5|$|According to Keisuke Iwata, {{the global}} spread of Japanese {{animation}} dramatically expanded {{due to the}} popularity of Evangelion. After {{the success of the}} show, otaku culture gained wide attention. In Japan, Evangelion prompted a review of the cultural value of anime, and with its success, anime reached a new point of maturity. With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, which John Lynden links to a boom in interest in literature on the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Scrolls,</b> Kabbalah and Christianity. Anime director Makoto Shinkai declared that the genre of anime owes a cinematographic debt to Evangelion. In the aftermath of Evangelion, Anno reused many of its stylistic conceits in the live-action Love & Pop and the anime romance Kare Kano. Neon Genesis Evangelion also influenced some music artists, such as the UK band Fightstar and its debut album, Grand Unification, and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from the character of Rei Ayanami.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Some {{fragments}} of the <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Scroll</b> manuscripts were contaminated with castor oil in the late 1950 s. We have conducted experiments {{in order to establish}} if the AAA pretreatment cleaning procedures conducted on <b>Dead</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Scroll</b> manuscript samples in the last two dating series (Bonani et al. 1992; Jull et al. 1995) were effective in removing oil contami-nation. Our experiments show that not all oil contamination can be expected to have been removed by the acid-alkaline-acid (AAA) pretreatment, and that the radiocarbon ages previously reported therefore cannot be guaranteed to be correct. Any sam-ples contaminated with castor oil were most likely reported with ages that are too young by an unknown amount...|$|R

25|$|Qumran–Sectarian {{theories}} are {{variations on the}} Qumran–Essene theory.
