5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints <b>in</b> <b>producing</b> air-borne sounds.

The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E

5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall.

Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights.

40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} {{linked to}} Salmonella-contaminated produce heightened {{the need to}} develop simple, rapid, and accurate detection methods, particularly those capable of determining cell viability. In this study, we examined a novel strategy for the rapid detection and quantification of viable salmonellae <b>in</b> <b>produce</b> by coupling a simple propidium monoazide sample treatment with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (PMA-LAMP). We first designed and optimized a LAMP assay targeting Salmonella. Second, the performance of PMA-LAMP for detecting and quantifying viable salmonellae was determined. Finally, the assay was evaluated <b>in</b> experimentally contaminated <b>produce</b> items (cantaloupe, spinach, and tomato). Under the optimized condition, PMA-LAMP consistently gave negative results for heat-killed Salmonella cells with concentrations up to 108 CFU/ml (or CFU/g <b>in</b> <b>produce).</b> The detection limits of PMA-LAMP were 3. 4 to 34 viable Salmonella cells in pure culture and 6. 1 × 103 to 6. 1 × 104 CFU/g <b>in</b> spiked <b>produce</b> samples. <b>In</b> comparison, PMA-PCR was up to 100 -fold less sensitive. The correlation between LAMP time threshold (TT) values and viable Salmonella cell numbers was high (R 2 = 0. 949 to 0. 993), with a quantification range (102 to 105 CFU/reaction in pure culture and 104 to 107 CFU/g <b>in</b> <b>produce)</b> comparable to that of PMA in combination with quantitative real-time PCR (PMA-qPCR). The complete PMA-LAMP assay took about 3 h to complete when testing <b>produce</b> samples. <b>In</b> conclusion, this rapid, accurate, and simple method to detect and quantify viable Salmonella cells <b>in</b> <b>produce</b> may present a useful tool for the produce industry to better control potential microbial hazards <b>in</b> <b>produce...</b>|$|R
