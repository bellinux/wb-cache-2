500|$|The Metacomet Ridge hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual to the region. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red-cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be similar to the adjacent upland plateaus and nearby Appalachians, containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest <b>ecosystem</b> <b>types.</b> Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in the region. Miles of high cliffs make ideal raptor habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the prickly pear cactus, peregrine falcon, northern copperhead, showy lady's slipper, yellow corydalis, ram's–head lady's slipper, basil mountain mint, and devil's bit lily.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{drivers of}} {{aboveground}} {{net primary production}} (ANPP) {{has long been a}} goal of ecology. Decades of investigation have shown total annual precipitation to be an important determinant of ANPP within and across ecosystems. Recently a few studies at individual sites have shown precipitation during specific seasons of the year can more effectively predict ANPP. Here we determined whether seasonal or total precipitation better predicted ANPP across a range of terrestrial ecosystems, from deserts to forests, using long-term data from 36 plant communities. We also determined whether ANPP responses were dependent on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type</b> or plant functional group. We found that seasonal precipitation generally explained ANPP better than total precipitation. Precipitation in multiple parts of the growing season often correlated with ANPP, but rarely interacted with each other. Surprisingly, the amount of variation explained by seasonal precipitation was not correlated with <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type</b> or plant functional group. Overall, examining seasonal precipitation can significantly improve ANPP predictions across a broad range of <b>ecosystems</b> and plant <b>types,</b> with implications for understanding current and future ANPP variation. Further work examining precipitation timing relative to species phenology may further improve our ability to predict ANPP, especially in response to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic inputs of trace {{elements}} (TE) into soils constitute {{a major public}} and environmental health problem. Bioavailability of TE is strongly related to the soil physicochemical parameters and thus to the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type.</b> In order to test whether soil parameters influence {{the response of the}} bacterial community to TE pollution, we collected soil samples across contrasting ecosystems (hardwood, coniferous and hydromorphic soils), which have been contaminated in TE and especially lead (Pb) over several decades due to nearby industrial smelting activities. Bacterial community composition was analysed using high throughput amplicon sequencing and compared to the soil physicochemical parameters. Multivariate analyses of the pedological and biological data revealed that the bacterial community composition was affected by <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type</b> in the first place. An influence of the contamination level was also evidenced within each ecosystem. Despite the important variability in bacterial community structure, we found that specific bacterial groups such as γ-Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae showed a consistent response to Pb content across contrasting ecosystems. Verrucomicrobia were less abundant at high contamination level whereas Chlamydiae and γ-Proteobacteria were more abundant. We conclude that such groups and ratio's thereof can be considered as relevant bioindicators of Pb contamination...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ecological {{attributes}} estimated {{from food}} web models {{have the potential}} to be indicators of good environmental status given their capabilities to describe redundancy, food web changes, and sensitivity to fishing. They {{can be used as a}} baseline to show how they might be modified in the future with human impacts such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, or overfishing. Methodology: In this study ecological network analysis indicators of 105 marine food web models were tested for variation with traits such as <b>ecosystem</b> <b>type,</b> latitude, ocean basin, depth, size, time period, and exploitation state, whilst also considering structural properties of the models such as number of linkages, number of living functional groups or total number of functional groups as covariate factors. Principal findings: Eight indicators were robust to model construction: relative ascendency; relative overhead; redundancy; total systems throughput (TST); primary production/TST; consumption/TST; export/TST; and total biomass of the community. Large-scale differences were seen in the ecosystems of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the Western Atlantic being more complex with an increased ability to mitigate impacts, while the Eastern Atlantic showed lower internal complexity.
