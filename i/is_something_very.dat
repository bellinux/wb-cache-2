[...] "The {{behaviour}} of Hannibal {{is never}} insane— didn't {{want to use}} that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as you or I. He just likes it." [...] Scott did say, however, [...] "In our normal terms, he's truly evil." [...] Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film's end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.|$|E

500|$|In March 1810, {{he married}} the 19-year old Marie Louise, Archduchess of Austria, {{and a great}} niece of Marie Antoinette by proxy; thus he had married into a German royal and {{imperial}} family. [...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to see the man {{would be the worst}} form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. [...] However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. [...] After her wedding, she wrote to her father [...] "He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist".|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} picked {{to be part}} of the young adult fantasy genre due to its {{increasing}} popularity. Cherith Baldry feel that the growth of genre is due to the fact that [...] "fantasy <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> deeply rooted in the human mind, not just for children". Fantasy stories are able to deal with human emotions helping readers to deal with them in the real world. Another Erin Hunter, Kate Cary felt that fantasy books such as Harry Potter [...] "is a sign of a deepening need for fantasy to brighten our lives". She describes how as a child she was far less restricted than today's children whose days are structured and scheduled. Cary feels that fantasy stories help kids [...] "escape into the world of the imagination, because it’s the only place they can be really free and un-judged".|$|E
500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to people on that tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> wrong with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E

500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding rates of change. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> crude & childlike about German diplomacy. Meanwhile the French are beginning to press in the opposite sense, as the Russians have been doing for some time. The City, wh. is in a terrible state of depression and paralysis, is the time being all against English intervention." ...|$|E
2500|$|Logically, many theorems are of {{the form}} of an {{indicative}} conditional: if A, then B. Such a theorem does not assert B, only that B is a necessary consequence of A. In this case A is called the hypothesis of the theorem ("hypothesis" [...] here <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> different from a conjecture) and B the conclusion (formally, A and B are termed the antecedent and consequent). The theorem [...] "If n is an even natural number then n/2 is a natural number" [...] is a typical example in which the hypothesis is [...] "n is an even natural number" [...] and the conclusion is [...] "n/2 is also a natural number".|$|E
2500|$|His {{attitude}} towards homosexual Ethiopians remains orthodox. In December 2008, {{he was one}} of nearly a dozen Ethiopian religious figures (including the leader of Ethiopian Muslim Majlis Council and the heads of the Protestant and Catholic churches) who adopted a resolution against homosexuality, urging Ethiopian lawmakers to endorse a ban on homosexual activity in the constitution. The religious figures attributed a rise in sexual attacks on children and young men to the vice of homosexuality. Abuna Paulos went on to say, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> strange in Ethiopia, the land of the Bible that condemns this very strongly. For people to act in this manner they have to be dumb, stupid like animals. We strongly condemn this behaviour. They (homosexuals) have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated, they have to be given a lesson." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the TV Guide, Allison DuBois {{spent four}} years {{participating}} in various tests at the University of Arizona to assist with their studies of mediums and psychic phenomena. Gary Schwartz, Director of The VERITAS Research Project, claims that DuBois has psychic abilities, arguing in the March 6, 2005 TV Guide, [...] "Anyone who's looked closely at the evidence can't help but {{come to the conclusion}} that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> real going on here." [...] At their first meeting, Schwartz says DuBois accurately described a friend of Schwartz's who had just died. Impressed, Schwartz conducted a series of interviews, including one in which DuBois stated she contacted the late husband of a woman in England, knowing only the woman's name. The woman, after reading a transcript of the session, affirmed that 80% of what DuBois said was accurate. Schwartz published his research in a book titled The Truth About Medium. According to a statement by DuBois, she does not endorse the book or Schwartz.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to give yourself the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking forward to getting up to Sydney. It's a great footy club and, as I said, I had to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to the boys <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Casting for Broadchurch series one was {{overseen by}} casting {{directors}} Kelly Valentine Hendry and Victor Jenkins of VHJ Casting. New series two cast members included James D'Arcy, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Eve Myles, Charlotte Rampling, Meera Syal, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. None {{of the new}} characters were connected to the Latimer murder or any other homicide, Chibnall said. Rampling {{was named to the}} cast on 12 May, and Chibnall said her [...] "character {{is an integral part of}} the new story". He decided to ask Rampling to join the cast after seeing her perform in a video art piece directed by Steve McQueen. [...] "She was so lively and mischievous but also tough and steely and I thought, that's such a match for how I see this character," [...] Chibnall said. ITV announced that D'Arcy, Jean-Baptiste, Myles, and Waller-Bridge were joining the series on 21 May 2014. Rampling, who lives in France, had seen series one on French television and was a fan of the programme. [...] "The sense of community, the idea of solidarity in a small town — all that is broken when suspicion starts to creep in. There <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> human about it. You don't know what happens in real life when people suffer this kind of tragedy. People go off and live their lives. But here we can actually accompany them and go through the grieving process with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campaign slogan and {{advertisement}} by LSD and Civic party {{calling for}} [...] "uprising of the people" [...] (全民起義), attracted media attention and {{the ire of}} Beijing. Reception of the slogan was particularly negative by the pro-Beijing camp. [...] Rita Fan attacked the term saying it would set a dangerous precedent by misleading the public over {{the purpose of the}} by-elections. [...] She said anyone who has studied Chinese history would know that the word [...] "uprising" [...] convey an image of revolution, blood, and violence and that it would make people think of social turmoil, hardship and chaos. Maria Tam said an uprising usually refers to overthrowing the government through violence, and Former Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung warned of anarchy. Ip Kwok-him, Deputy Chairman of the DAB, said the slogan was seditious; but Audrey Eu said it was an attempt to intimidate the Hong Kong people. Eu said that the 4 Chinese characters do not refer to a violent revolution and that the resignation is not a ploy to seek independence of Hong Kong; Wong Yuk-man emphasised it as a [...] "peaceful uprising". Gordon Wu said the Civic Party and the LSD were destabilising Hong Kong by resigning, and likened the call for people to rise up to action taken by red guards during the Cultural Revolution. Wu said: [...] "Uprising <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> thrilling - although we have not reached the stage of armed struggle." [...] Organisers for the resigners dismissed the criticism as tactics aimed at dampening turnout for the by-elections.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>very</b> like the same old story." ...|$|E
