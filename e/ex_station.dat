40|$|Background. Essential Skills in the Management of Surgical Cases (ESMSC) is an international, animal model-based course. It {{combines}} interactive lectures {{with basic}} <b>ex</b> vivo <b>stations</b> and more advanced wet lab modules, that is, in vivo dissections and Heart Transplant Surgery on a swine model. Materials and Methods. Forty-nine medical students (male, N= 27, female N= 22, and mean age = 23. 7 years) from King’s College London (KCL) and Greek Medical Schools attended the course. Participants were assessed with Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), {{as well as}} Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Paired t-test associations were used to evaluate whether there was statistically significant improvement in their performance. Aim. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} a combined applied surgical science and wet lab simulation course as a teaching model for surgical skills at the undergraduate level. Results. The mean MCQ score was improved by 2. 33 / 32 (P< 0. 005). Surgical skills competences, as defined by DOPS scores, were improved in a statically significant manner (P< 0. 005 for all paired t-test correlations). Conclusions. ESMSC seems to be an effective teaching model, which improves the understanding of the surgical approach and the basic surgical skills. In vivo models could be used potentially as a step further in the Undergraduate Surgical Education...|$|R
40|$|NASA has terabytes of {{multimedia}} data for exploration of Space Science, Atmospheric Science, Flight Dynamics, Life Sciences, {{and other related}} fields of science. This data is available in electronic and other forms. Scientists {{and the general public}} including students should be able to use it in learning and scientific research. The task of accessing this data can be made simple by using a variety of user interfaces and the notion digital libraries. A digital library contains text, images, and sound in an integrated document repository. Digital libraries can be networked to give users (local/remote) access to a vast amount of data, information, knowledge, and vision. The concept of digital libraries can be realized by enhancing and integrating technologies in databases, communication networks, user interfaces, knowledge management, and information retrieval.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{corrosion}} resistance of organic coatings addition with nano-sized TiO 2 and SiO 2 was studied based on influencing factors of protection with coatings. The corrosion protection performances of coatings were further discussed such as adhesion between the coatings and the metal substrate; barrier property of coatings to penetration {{of water and}} ions; the coatings microstructure and the galvano-chemistry performance with the SEM and IM 6 <b>EX</b> electrochemical active <b>station.</b> The results indicate that homogeneous nano fillers can improve the fluidity and permeability of the epoxy, stiffen the adhesion between the coatings and the metal substrate. In the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments, the impedance diagram showed the Warburg characteristic impedance. It means that nano-sized grains impede the diffusion of electrolyte in the coatings, which improves the {{corrosion resistance}} of the metal substrate. As the soak time increases, {{the structure of the}} organic coating involved, the obstructive of the nano-particles lessened, and the characteristic of the EIS was also changed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE We {{aimed to}} develop and {{validate}} an <b>ex</b> vivo dissection <b>station</b> for endolaryngeal surgery suitable for different kinds of laryngeal specimen and any type of operating technique (CO 2 laser, cold instruments by endoscopic or microscopic techniques). STUDY DESIGN Experimental construction and validation of a highly specialized dissection station. SETTING Laboratory and international dissection course. METHODS We designed a lightweight dissection station made of polycarbonate resin approved for use with a CO 2 laser. The cylindrical box hosts an articulated laryngeal support. The laryngoscope is positioned on an articulated arm, which is fixed on the construction's footplate. Validation of the larynx box was performed during an international dissection course on laryngeal surgery held in January 2016. RESULTS We assessed the suitability of our novel dissection station among specialized laryngologists with a mean experience of 14 years. Feedback from the participants was very positive, with a mean general impression of 9. 5 (out of 10 points) and a recommendation score of 9. 6 for further use. Its utility in transforming the taught surgical steps into daily practice has been highly recognized, with a score of 9. 5. CONCLUSION The lightweight and transparent larynx box is suitable {{for any kind of}} laryngeal specimen, and any surgical intervention can be taught at reasonable cost. It is safe and suitable for use with CO 2 lasers. Validation among experienced surgeons revealed its suitability in the teaching of endolaryngeal microsurgery and laser surgery...|$|R
