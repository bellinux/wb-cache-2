40|$|In this case, the CJEU {{answers the}} {{question}} whether Article 1 (3) of the Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant must be interpreted as meaning that when there are strong indications that detention conditions in the <b>issuing</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> infringe Article 4 of the Charter, the executing judicial authority must refuse surrender of the person against whom a European arrest warrant is issued. The CJEU rules that if, after a two-stage assessment, the executing judicial authority finds {{that there is a}} real risk of an Article 4 violation for the requested person once surrendered, the execution of the arrest warrant must initially be deferred and, where such a risk cannot be discounted, the executing judicial authority must {{decide whether or not to}} terminate the surrender procedure.

40|$|This case-note {{provides}} a critical overview of Joined Cases C- 404 / 15 and C- 659 / 15 PPU, Aranyosi and Căldăraru. The CJEU tries {{to reconcile the}} principles of mutual trust and recognition with {{the protection of the}} fundamental rights of the requested person. Instead of introducing a new ground of refusal for a European Arrest Warrant based on the breach of fundamental rights, the CJEU opted for a ground of postponement. Furthermore, it brings its two-tier ‘systemic deficiencies’ test closer to the standards used by the ECtHR and encourages dialogue between the issuing and executing judicial authorities. Nevertheless, the scope of application of the new ground of postponement is not entirely clear and it is not yet sure what happens after the executing judicial authority postpones its decision due to evidence of a real risk that the requested person will be subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment in the <b>issuing</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State...</b>|$|E

40|$|The chapter revisits the {{innovations}} {{introduced by the}} Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) {{and the establishment of}} an EU-wide system of free movement of judicial decisions in criminal matters, covering both pre-sentence and final decisions, within an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. It focuses upon the functionality of the principle of mutual recognition and identifies certain problem areas that limit the substantive scope of the EAW. The chapter first examines the two major reforms introduced by the Framework Decision, namely the abolition of the ‘double criminality’ test and the limited grounds for refusal of execution, especially the rule against surrendering nationals. It is argued that such a refusal cannot now rest on any human rights considerations, despite its constitutional premise in a number of cases. The chapter also provides a commentary on the paradox that, while the Framework Decision dispenses with verification of the double criminality test for the categories of listed offences, it leaves the definition of those offences (and the penalties applicable in each case) to the <b>issuing</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> And in accordance with the Framework Decision, the Member State must respect fundamental rights as enshrined in Article 6 TEU as well as the principle of legality.
