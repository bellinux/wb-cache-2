50|$|Spindle - This {{component}} {{holds the}} magnetic patters together and {{is responsible for}} spinning the <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> when required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>platter</b> - This is {{the actual}} disk where the user’s data is {{recorded}} on. Consists of patterns on which the computer navigates through the data using the principle of magnetic flux.|$|E
5000|$|A servowriter is used {{to write}} servo tracks on the <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> which make up part of the {{servomechanism}} that positions the actuator arm.|$|R
50|$|Data {{that was}} {{accepted}} in write cache of a disk device will be eventually written to <b>disk</b> <b>platters,</b> provided that no starvation condition occurs {{as a result}} of firmware flaw, and that disk power supply is not interrupted before cached writes are forced to <b>disk</b> <b>platters.</b> In order to control write cache, ATA specification included FLUSH CACHE (E7h) and FLUSH CACHE EXT (EAh) commands. These commands cause the disk to complete writing data from its cache, and disk will return good status after data in the write cache is written to disk media. In addition, flushing the cache can be initiated at least to some disks by issuing Soft reset or Standby (Immediate) command.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, nearly all disks sold have {{embedded}} microcontrollers and either an ATA, Serial ATA, SCSI, or Fibre Channel interface. The drive circuitry usually {{has a small}} amount of memory, used to store the data going to and coming from the <b>disk</b> <b>platters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} the disk's I/O {{interface}} to the computer almost never matches {{the speed at which}} the bits are transferred to and from the hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter.</b> The disk buffer is used so that both the I/O interface and the disk read/write head can operate at full speed.|$|E
5000|$|Disk read/write {{heads are}} the small {{parts of a}} disk drive that move above the <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> and {{transform}} the platter's magnetic field into electrical current (read the disk) or, vice versa, transform electrical current into magnetic field (write the disk). [...] The heads have gone {{through a number of}} changes over the years.|$|E
50|$|The SparQ {{drive is}} a removable-disk hard drive made by SyQuest Technology. It was {{introduced}} in 1997. The drive was available as an internal version with IDE interface, and an external version for the parallel port. The disk can store 1 GB of data, and, as removable-disk hard drive, contains a solid hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> on which the data is stored.|$|E
25|$|When {{the logic}} board {{of a hard}} disk fails, the drive can often be {{restored}} to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, {{can be used for}} data recovery. Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.|$|R
5000|$|When {{transferring}} from a rotational disk, much of {{the delay}} is caused by seek time, {{the time it takes}} to correctly position the read/write heads above the <b>disk</b> <b>platters.</b> Because of this, large sequential transfers are more efficient than several smaller transfers. Transferring the same amount of data from disk to memory often requires less time with larger pages than with smaller pages.|$|R
50|$|A Disk pack is a layered {{grouping}} of hard <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> (circular, rigid discs {{coated with a}} magnetic data storage surface). A disk pack is the core component of a hard disk drive. In modern hard disks, the disk pack is permanently sealed inside the drive. In many early hard disks, the disk pack was a removable unit, and would be supplied with a protective canister featuring a lifting handle.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, {{disk buffer}} (often ambiguously called disk cache or cache buffer) is the embedded memory {{in a hard}} disk drive (HDD) acting as a buffer between {{the rest of the}} computer and the physical hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> that is used for storage. Modern hard disk drives come with 8 to 256 MiB of such memory, and solid-state drives come with up to 1 GB of cache memory.|$|E
5000|$|A {{device called}} a head reads and writes {{data in a}} hard drive by {{manipulating}} the magnetic medium that composes the surface of an associated <b>disk</b> <b>platter.</b> Naturally, a platter has 2 sides and thus 2 surfaces on which data can be manipulated; usually there are 2 heads per platter, one per side. (Sometimes the term side is substituted for head, since platters might be separated from their head assemblies, as with the removable media of a floppy drive.) ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the same}} time frame a {{transition}} to perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) is occurring, in which for reasons of improved stability and higher areal density potential, the traditional in-plane orientation of magnetization in the disk is being changed to a perpendicular orientation. This has major implications for the write process and the write head structure, {{as well as for}} the design of the magnetic disk media or hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter,</b> less directly so for the read sensor of the magnetic head.|$|E
50|$|Secondary storage was {{composed}} of up to 8 of the CDC 9432D removable-media disk drive devices. Capacity of one set of <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> was about 4 million 6-bit words or 768,000 words of HRS-100 computer. Total, combined, capacity of 8 drives is, therefore, 6,144,000 words. Each disk set comprised 6 platters out of which 10 surfaces are used. Data was organized into 100 cylinders and 16 1536-bit sectors (48 HRS-100 words).|$|R
5000|$|Windows (Vista and up) {{supports}} FUA {{as part of}} Transactional NTFS, {{but only}} for SCSI or Fibre Channel disks where support for FUA is common. [...] It is not known whether a SATA drive that supports FUA write commands will actually honor the command and write data to <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> as instructed; thus, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 instead send commands to flush the disk write cache after certain write operations.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{triaxial}} accelerometer, {{the shock}} detector detects sudden acceleration, {{such as when}} the computer is dropped, and prepares the relatively fragile hard disk drive mechanism for impact. The system disengages the disk drive heads from the hard <b>disk</b> <b>platters,</b> preventing data loss and drive damage from a disk head crash. When the computer is stable, the drive operates normally again. A clicking noise can be heard when the sudden motion sensor activates.|$|R
50|$|Heat-assisted {{magnetic}} recording (HAMR) is a magnetic storage technology for hard drives {{in which a}} small laser is used to heat {{the part of the}} disk that is being written to. The heat reduces the coercivity of the material, hence allowing the head to write on materials with higher coercivity, which in turn allow for smaller grain size which is limited by the superparamagnetic effect hence increasing the maximum possible areal density. The net effect of HAMR is to allow writing on a much smaller scale than before, greatly increasing the amount of data that can be held on a standard <b>disk</b> <b>platter.</b>|$|E
50|$|An early disk {{cartridge}} {{was a single}} hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> encased in a protective plastic shell. When the removable cartridge was inserted into the cartridge drive peripheral device, the read/write heads of the drive could access the magnetic data storage surface of the platter through holes in the shell. The {{disk cartridge}} was a direct evolution from the disk pack drive, or the early hard drive. As the storage density improved, even a single platter would provide a useful amount of data storage space, with the benefit being easier to handle than a removable disk pack. An example of a cartridge drive is the IBM 2310, used on the IBM 1130. Disk cartridges were made obsolete by floppy disks.|$|E
5000|$|In all {{turntables}} a motor spins a metal disk at {{a constant}} speed. On top of the rotating <b>disk</b> (<b>platter)</b> is a mat {{and on top of}} the mat records are placed to be played. In the past rubber mats were used to hold the record in place so that it would not rotate independently of the platter. Nowadays slipmats are used to reduce the friction between the spinning platter and record, and is often made of a felt-like material. This way a DJ can scratch the record while the platter continues to spin underneath. In direct-drive turntables, the slipmat also helps isolate the record from motor vibrations that would be picked up by the stylus.|$|E
30|$|Each “Hard Disk” has the {{following}} different energy-related attributes: rpm indicates the rotation per {{minute of the}} <b>disk,</b> <b>platters</b> denotes the number of platters, whereas AAM presents whether the hard disk is equipped with Automatic Acoustic Adjustment feature. For the “Solid State Disk”, powerByRead and powerByWrite denote respectively the power consumed by read and write operations. The distinction here {{is due to the}} fact that read and write operations in solid state disks have different power consumption behaviour.|$|R
50|$|One lesser-known {{feature of}} NCQ is that, unlike its ATA TCQ predecessor, {{it allows the}} host to specify whether {{it wants to be}} {{notified}} when the data reaches the <b>disk's</b> <b>platters,</b> or when it reaches the disk's buffer (on-board cache). Assuming a correct hardware implementation, this feature allows data consistency to be guaranteed when the disk's on-board cache is used in conjunction with system calls like fsync. The associated write flag, which is also borrowed from SCSI, is called Force Unit Access (FUA).|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{initializing}} these logical blocks {{on the physical}} <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> is called low-level formatting, which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field. High-level formatting writes data structures used by the operating system to organize data files on the disk. This includes [...] writing partition and file system structures into selected logical blocks. For example, some of the disk space {{will be used to}} hold a directory of disk file names and a list of logical blocks associated with a particular file.|$|R
50|$|The {{protective}} cover {{consisted of two}} parts, a clear plastic shell, with a handle in the center, that enclosed the top and sides of the disks and a separate bottom that completed the sealed package. To remove the disk pack, the drive would be taken off line and allowed to spin down. Its access door could then be opened and an empty top shell inserted and twisted to unlock the <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> from the drive and secure {{it to the top}} shell. The assembly would then be lifted out and the bottom cover attached. A different disk pack could then be inserted by removing the bottom and placing the disk pack with its top shell into the drive. Turning the handle would lock the disk pack in place and free the top shell for removal.|$|E
50|$|SSD, {{regarded}} as the future of data storage, is a technology recently available to the consumers. However expensive, these {{state of the art}} drives are considerably smaller. Data on such drives is statically twice as safer i.e. such drives crash less.First of all, these drives do not involve magnetic principles. These drives use semiconductors to store data unlike the <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> used in the Hard Disk Drives. SSDs use the principle of flash drive. It consists of no actual mechanical parts i.e. no movements of parts is involved. Usually the HDD data is referred to as volatile memory, this really means that when the computer loses power, all the memory is lost. However, in the case of Solid State Drives, there are chips which deliver non-volatile memory meaning the data is stored even when there is a loss of power with the machine.|$|E
50|$|When reading {{data from}} a {{conventional}} electromechanical hard disk drive, the disk controller must first position the head, relatively slowly, to the track where a given fragment resides, and then wait while the <b>disk</b> <b>platter</b> rotates until the fragment reaches the head. A solid-state drive (SSD) is based on flash memory with no moving parts, so random access of a file fragment on flash memory does not suffer this delay, making defragmentation to optimize access speed unnecessary. Furthermore, since flash memory can be written to {{only a limited number}} of times before it fails, defragmentation is actually detrimental (except in the mitigation of catastrophic failure). However, Windows still defragments a SSD automatically (albeit less vigorously) to prevent file system from reaching its maximum fragmentation tolerance. Once the maximum fragmentation limit is reached, subsequent attempts to write to disk fail.|$|E
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating <b>disks</b> (<b>platters)</b> coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept is}} concentric, hollow, {{cylindrical}} slices through the physical <b>disks</b> (<b>platters),</b> collecting the respective circular tracks aligned through {{the stack of}} platters. The number of cylinders of a disk drive exactly equals the number of tracks on a single surface in the drive. It comprises the same track number on each platter, spanning all such tracks across each platter surface that is able to store data (without regard {{to whether or not}} the track is [...] "bad"). Cylinders are vertically formed by tracks. In other words, track 12 on platter 0 plus track 12 on platter 1 etc. is cylinder 12.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Toshiba's MK1122FC was {{the first}} hard disk drive to use a glass hard <b>disk</b> drive <b>platter,</b> {{replacing}} the earlier aluminium platters. Glass platters had several advantages, such as greater shock resistance, compared to aluminium platter.|$|R
50|$|Since a {{disk drive}} is a {{physical}} piece of hardware, the rotational speed of the drive can change slightly, due {{to a change in}} the motor speed or thermal expansion of the <b>disk</b> <b>platter.</b> The physical media on a floppy disk can also become deformed, causing larger timing errors, and the timing circuit on the controller itself may have small variations in speed. The problem is that, with a long string of zeros, there's no way for the disk drive's controller to know the exact position of the read head, and thus no way to know exactly how many zeros there are. A speed variation of even 0.1% - which is more precise than any practical floppy drive - could result in four bits being added to or removed from the 4,096 bit data stream. Without some form of synchronization and error correction, the data would become completely unusable.|$|E
50|$|The RT-11 {{operating}} {{system could be}} booted from, and perform useful work on, a machine consisting of two 8-inch 250KB floppy disks and 56KB of memory, and could support 8 terminals. Other boot options include the RK05 2.5MB removable hard <b>disk</b> <b>platter,</b> or magnetic tape. Distributions were available pre-installed or on punched tape, magnetic tape, cartridge tape, or floppy disk. A minimal but complete system supporting a single real-time user could run on a single floppy disk and in 8K 16-bit words (16KB) of RAM, including user programs. This was facilitated by support for swapping and overlaying. To realize operation on such small memory system, the keyboard command user interface would be swapped out during the execution of a user's program and then swapped into memory upon program termination. The system supported a real-time clock, printing terminal, VT11 vector graphic unit, 16 channel 100 kHz A/D converter with 2 channel D/A, 9600 baud serial port, 16 bit bidirectional boards, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The popular {{explanation}} for the advantage of perpendicular recording is that it achieves higher storage densities by aligning the poles of the magnetic elements, which represent bits, perpendicularly {{to the surface of}} the <b>disk</b> <b>platter,</b> as shown in the illustration. In this not-quite-accurate explanation, aligning the bits in this manner takes less platter than what would have been required had they been placed longitudinally. This means cells can be placed closer together on the platter, thus increasing the number of magnetic elements that can be stored in a given area. The true picture is a bit more complex, having to do with the use of a magnetically [...] "stronger" [...] (higher coercivity) material as the storage medium. This is possible because in a perpendicular arrangement the magnetic flux is guided through a magnetically soft (and relatively thick) underlayer underneath the hard magnetic media films (considerably complicating and thickening the total disk structure). This magnetically soft underlayer can be effectively considered a part of the write head, making the write head more efficient, thus making it possible to produce a stronger write field gradient with essentially the same head materials as for longitudinal heads, and therefore allowing for the use of the higher coercivity magnetic storage medium. A higher coercivity medium is inherently thermally more stable, as stability is proportional to the product of bit (or magnetic grain) volume times the uniaxial anisotropy constant Ku, which in turn is higher for a material with a higher magnetic coercivity.|$|E
50|$|In ion-assisted {{deposition}} (IAD), {{the substrate}} {{is exposed to}} a secondary ion beam operating at a lower power than the sputter gun. Usually a Kaufman source, like that used in IBS, supplies the secondary beam. IAD {{can be used to}} deposit carbon in diamond-like form on a substrate. Any carbon atoms landing on the substrate which fail to bond properly in the diamond crystal lattice will be knocked off by the secondary beam. NASA used this technique to experiment with depositing diamond films on turbine blades in the 1980s. IAD is used in other important industrial applications such as creating tetrahedral amorphous carbon surface coatings on hard <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> and hard transition metal nitride coatings on medical implants.|$|R
50|$|Semiconductor memory doubles in {{size for}} each address lane added to an {{integrated}} circuit package, which favors counts that are powers of two. The {{capacity of a}} disk drive {{is the product of}} the sector size, number of sectors per track, number of tracks per side, and the number of <b>disk</b> <b>platters</b> in the drive. Changes in any of these factors would not usually double the size. Sector sizes were set as powers of two (most common 512 bytes or 4096 bytes) for convenience in processing. It was a natural extension to give the capacity of a disk drive in multiples of the sector size, giving a mix of decimal and binary multiples when expressing total disk capacity.|$|R
5000|$|In SCSI and in SATA with Native Command Queuing (but not {{in plain}} ATA, even with TCQ) the host can specify whether {{it wants to}} be {{notified}} of completion when the data hits the <b>disk's</b> <b>platters</b> or when it hits the disk's buffer (on-board cache). Assuming a correct hardware implementation, this feature allows the disk's on-board cache to be used while guaranteeing correct semantics for system calls like [...] This hardware feature is called Force Unit Access (FUA) and it allows consistency with less overhead than flushing the entire cache as done for ATA (or SATA non-NCQ) disks. Although Linux enabled NCQ around 2007, it did not enable SATA/NCQ FUA until 2012, citing lack of support in the early drives.|$|R
