5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its <b>high</b> <b>collar,</b> long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E

25|$|The current OSUMB uniform is very {{different}} from the earliest uniforms. The earliest band uniforms were military in style and were pieced together from U.S. military uniforms with pieces dating back to even the Civil War era. <b>High</b> <b>collar</b> jackets were the first solidified design for the band uniform. The first hats worn by the band were Pershing style military visor caps with military “peace” eagles as the hat emblem and red and gray “powder puff” plumes, so called because of the very fine, almost down-like feathers with which they were constructed. OSU also experimented with gray wool bucket hats that looked similar to a kepi or shako with a plume.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an {{assassination}} attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking a stroll {{with one of his}} officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell of Tír Chonaill, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost always wore a uniform, which had a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.|$|E

[...] His resplendent diplomat's uniform, {{which he used}} on all occasions, shone brightly with gold brocade and included a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> with white gloves, even in the tropical heat. [...] Such fashion was calculated {{to give him a}} larger-than-life presence, symbolic of the enormous empire he represented. [...] Paraguayans were sensitive to subtleties in appearance and they understood such an image... In appearance he suggested a modern European statesman, a man who combined shrewdness and easy familiarity with power...|$|E

2500|$|Beau Brummell set {{the fashion}} for dandyism in British society from the mid-1790s, which was {{characterized}} by immaculate personal cleanliness, immaculate linen shirts with <b>high</b> <b>collars,</b> perfectly tied cravats, and exquisitely tailored plain dark coats (contrasting in many respects with the [...] "maccaroni" [...] of the earlier 18th century).|$|R

Compared to a modern ao dai, {{the front and back}} flaps were much broader and the fit looser and much shorter. It had a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> and was buttoned in the same fashion as a modern ao dai. Women could wear the dress with the top few buttons undone, revealing a glimpse of their yếm underneath.|$|E
500|$|Early {{concepts}} for {{the film}} called for a [...] "fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied" [...] Queen. However, Walt Disney became concerned that such an approach would make the character seem less plausible. Sensing that more time was needed {{for the development of}} the Queen, he advised that attention be paid exclusively to [...] "scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear." [...] Disney further developed the main plot himself (Ollie Johnston said the film's story was based on the idea that the Queen's character was going to murder [...] "another drawing" [...] and Disney decided to make it appear believable), finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, whom he envisioned as a mixture of Lady Macbeth and the Big Bad Wolf, and decided to set on [...] "a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> stately beautiful type" [...] whose [...] "beauty is sinister, mature, plenty of curves – she becomes ugly and menacing when scheming." [...] According to the 1993 Disney Classics series of trading cards, [...] "she is really two characters, the beautiful evil Queen and the grotesquely evil witch." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacques-Belletête {{worked on}} {{character}} designs with Murray, whose previous work included artwork for the comic series 2000 AD. Before designing character costumes, Jacques-Belletête looked extensively at modern fashion. As focusing purely on Renaissance styling {{would have resulted}} in clothing styles deemed [...] "too allegoric" [...] to work in the game, they redesigned them so they included Renaissance and cyberpunk elements while resembling clothing people would wear in the present day and not appearing cliched. For Adam's character design, the team looked at multiple protagonist from cyberpunk fiction, from Blade Runner to the original Deus Ex. Their main wishes were to incorporate sunglasses and a trench coat. Jacques-Belletête moderated his design to combine Renaissance aesthetics with the cyberpunk thematics: he defined it as being able to see Adam's augmented state in combat during the brief third-person camera moments while still seeing him having a meal in a high-class restaurant. One design which had him sleeveless throughout the game was scrapped as it made him [...] "look like a douche". Instead, they created two looks: a sleeveless action-oriented look for missions, and a sleeved trench coat with a <b>high</b> <b>collar</b> and geometric patterning to portray the Renaissance elements. In total, it took two years and a half to finalize Adam's design, with multiple designs being rejected as they failed to properly balance the cyberpunk and Renaissance elements.|$|E
25|$|During the Victorian period, {{social attitudes}} {{required}} women {{to cover their}} bosom in public. For ordinary wear, <b>high</b> <b>collars</b> were the norm. Towards {{the end of the}} Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see 1880s in fashion).|$|R

500|$|An {{official}} Disney.com blog Oh My Disney {{stated the}} Evil Queen has been [...] "the original Disney villain, and we’re really not exaggerating." [...] According to The Daily Telegraph, La Verne's {{role as the}} Queen [...] "was credited {{as the model for}} such future villains as Ursula in The Little Mermaid (1989) and Scar in The Lion King (1994)." [...] Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty inherited a number of characteristics from the Queen, including the cowl, <b>high</b> <b>collar,</b> billowing cloak, arched eyebrows, cruel lips, and raven familiar. An abandoned concept from Snow White was that the Queen kidnap the Prince and lock him in her dungeon; similarly, in Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent kidnaps Prince Philip. Lady Bane, a vain evil sorceress from Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears, too bears a similarity to the Evil Queen in her costume and character. Four wicked witches of the East, West, North and South, resembling the Witch from Disney's Snow White, are also the villains Mickey has to kill to save Disneyland in 1988's Mickey Mouse: The Computer Game. The first names for the magic-wielding antagonist couple The Glooms in Disney XD's own series The 7D (2014) ― set in a timeframe before the Seven Dwarfs first met Snow White ― might have been inspired by the Evil Queen character's alternate name [...] "Grimhilde", with the bumbling warlock husband named [...] "Grim" [...] and the determined witch wife named [...] "Hildy".|$|E
