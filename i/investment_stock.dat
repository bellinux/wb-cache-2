40|$|We {{propose a}} methodological {{framework}} {{to study the}} dynamics of inter-regional investment flow in Europe from a Complex Networks perspective, an approach with recent proven success in many fields including economics. In this work we study the network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we compute the inward-outward investment stocks {{at the level of}} firms, based on ownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the ownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the intuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development, to our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet. In this paper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling laws of activity, <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> and connectivity degree both at the level of firms and at the level of regions. In particular we find that <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> of firms is power law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for firm activity. On the other hand <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> and activity of regions turn out to be log-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that <b>investment</b> <b>stock</b> scales with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for stock market data, calling for further investigations on a possible general scaling law holding true in economical networks. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} long-run abnormal underperformance {{of equity}} issuers has stirred {{great interest in}} finance until real (growth) options explanations have been successfully developed and tested on American SEO data in recent years. Drawing on the existing literature and on a sample of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish seasoned equity offerings from 1997 to 2009 our paper highlights a risk pattern for the issuers around the SEO date consistent with the predictions of the real options theories, namely a risk run-up prior to issuance followed by a decrease in beta after issuance. We also find significant evidence of long-run abnormal performance for equally weighted SEO portfolios in factor regressions. The magnitude and {{the significance of the}} intercepts are reduced or eliminated if the SEO portfolios returns are value-weighted instead of equally weighted. An investment factor long in low <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> and short in high <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> used to augment CAPM and Fama French regressions does not clear the underperformance but does contribute to a small reduction in the magnitude and significance of the intercepts in factor regressions.

40|$|The European Commission's 2004 {{proposals}} for a Services Directive consists of measures {{to reduce or}} eliminate the obstacles of cross-border trade of services by introducing the 'country of origin' principle. It implies that regulation of the country of origin is relevant, and that the country of destination {{has no right to}} impose new regulation. Our results indicate that the introduction of the 2004 EU services directive in Switzerland would very much intensify the economic relations between the service industries of Switzerland and the European Union. We have investigated the direct effects of mutual liberalisation of services markets. These are positive, both for Switzerland and the EU. Swiss exports of commercial services to the EU could increase by 40 to 84 per cent, while Swiss foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> in EU services industries could increase by 20 to 41 per cent. EU services exports to Switzerland may rise by 41 to 85 per cent, while EU direct <b>investment</b> <b>stocks</b> in Swiss service markets could rise by 29 to 55 per cent.

40|$|According {{to foreign}} direct {{investment}} (FDI) path theory, developed countries are grouped into two phases, known as {{the fourth and fifth}} phases. Fourth-phase countries (newly developed economies) show a technological and institutional "gap" in comparison with fifth-phase economies, which explains their lesser capacity to generate direct investment. We found that these countries, which were less developed economies in the 1980 s, had undergone a deep structural transformation. This transformation encouraged the multinationalization of firms, which is a differentiating element and one outcome of their development process. These results have clear policy implications: the governments of newly developed countries should take steps to increase the endowment of knowledge-intensive assets. The main contribution of this paper is the theoretical reformulation of the fourth phase of the investment development path theory.

40|$|This paper {{produces}} {{an estimate of}} market-based human capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> for Canada over the period from 1970 to 2007 based on the lifetime income approach and compares it with that of physical and natural capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock.</b> It adopts the methodology developed by Jorgenson and Fraumeni, and estimates human capital stock as the expected future lifetime income of all individuals. Human capital investment is estimated as changes in human capital stock due to the addition of new members of the working age population arising from the rearing and education of children {{and the effect of}} immigration on human capital. The main findings are as follows: 1. The volume of aggregate human capital rose {{at an annual rate of}} 1. 7 % in Canada for the period 1970 to 2007, and most of the growth is due to the increase in the number of individuals in the working-age population. The rising education level of the Canadian population is also a significant contributing factor to the growth in human capital. 2. The compositional effects of aging of the Canadian population (a movement to a population that is older on average) reduced human capital growth by 0. 6 % per year over the period 1980 to 2007, while the rising education level increased human capital growth by 0. 7 % per year over the period. 3. Human capital stock on a per capita basis increased at 0. 9 % per year for the period 1970 to 1980, due to the rising education attainment during the period. After 1980, human capital stock per capita was virtually unchanged due to two offsetting factors: rising education level which increased human capital stock and the compositional effects of population aging, which reduced human capital stock. 4. The value of human capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> exceeds the value of physical capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock,</b> and the ratio of human capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> to physical capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> declined over time. In 2007, human capital stock is about four times as large as physical capital <b>stock</b> while <b>investment</b> in human capital is about two times the magnitude of investment in physical capital. 5. The levels of human capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made about expected future income growth and the rate used to discount the future income when calculating human capital, but the growth of the quantity and price of human capital <b>investment</b> and <b>stock</b> is not sensitive to the assumptions in these areas.
