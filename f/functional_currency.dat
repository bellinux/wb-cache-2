To explain this "dollarization hysteresis," this paper develops a model in which network externalities in the demand for currency can generate multiple stable steady states for the dollarization ratio. The model is estimated using a new source of data on dollar currency holdings in Russia. On the basis of these estimates, which confirm the existence of network externalities, the paper discusses several policies that could result in a permanent decrease in dollarization.

50|$|An {{increase}} in the general levelof prices implies {{a decrease in the}} purchasing power of the currency. That is, when the general level of prices rise, each monetary unit buys fewer goods and services. The effect of inflation is not distributed evenly in the economy, and as a consequence there are hidden costs to some and benefits to others from this decrease in the purchasing power of money. For example, with inflation, those segments in society which own physical assets, such as property, stock etc., benefit from the price/value of their holdings going up, when those who seek to acquire them will need to pay more for them. Their ability to do so will depend on the degree to which their income is fixed. For example, increases in payments to workers and pensioners often lag behind inflation, and for some people income is fixed. Also, individuals or institutions with cash assets will experience a decline in the purchasing power of the cash. Increases in the price level (inflation) erode the real value of money (the <b>functional</b> <b>currency)</b> and other items with an underlying monetary nature.|$|E
5000|$|Income {{statement}} constant {{items like}} salaries, wages, rents, pensions, utilities, transport fees, etc. are normally valued in units of CPP during low inflation in most economies as an annual update. Payments in money for these items are normally inflation-adjusted {{by means of}} the consumer price index (CPI) to compensate for the erosion of the real value of money (the monetary medium of exchange) by inflation only on an annual not daily basis. [...] "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" [...] and can only erode the real value of money (the <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> inside an economy) and other monetary items. Inflation can not and does not erode the real value of non-monetary items. Inflation has no effect on the real value of non-monetary items. Constant items´ real values are automatically maintained for an unlimited period of time in all entities that at least break even by the CMUCPP model as per the original Framework (1989) at all levels of inflation and deflation as authorized by the IASB since 1989 instead of currently being eroded by the implementation of the traditional HC model when the very erosive stable measuring unit assumption is applied. It is thus the stable measuring unit assumption and not inflation that erodes the real value of constant items never maintained constant at a rate equal to the inflation rate when the stable measuring unit assumption is implemented for an indefinite period of time during continuous low inflation.|$|E

40|$|An entity has {{a foreign}} {{subsidiary}} operating {{in an economy}} that is considered highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the entity's reporting currency has been used as the subsidiary's <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> in accordance with Statement 52. Except for inflation considerations, the subsidiary's <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> would have been the local currency. Because of significant declines in the rate of inflation for the local currency in recent years, the foreign economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. The issue is how the entity should account for a change in its subsidiary's <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> from the reporting currency to the local currency when the economy ceases to be considered highly inflationary. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that paragraph 46 of Statement 52 does not apply to this type of change and that the entity should restate the <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> accounting bases of nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the date of change as follows: the reporting currency amounts at the date of change should be translated into the local currency at current exchange rates and those amounts should become the new <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> accounting bases for the nonmonetary assets and liabilities.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Non-native species {{introductions}} are a ubiquitous form {{of environmental}} change. However, {{the role of}} introductions in ecosystem functioning is still poorly understood, especially in highly invaded systems with multiple non-native species. This thesis employs a functional trait framework— in which the net ecosystem effect of changing community structure is evaluated by quantifying change in the community-level distribution of biological traits— to assess the potential effects of multi-species introductions on ecosystem functioning in the Verde River, Arizona, USA. Specifically, I assess changes in body size distributions associated with non-native fish and crayfish introductions to estimate change in consumer-mediated nutrient recycling— an important size-scaling function in which aquatic consumers can control the rates and ratios of inorganic nutrient availability. In chapter 1, I compare the central moments of individual size distributions of basin-wide native and non-native fish species pools. Native and non-native species pools were characterized by significantly different mean, coefficient of variation, and skewness moments of individual size distributions. These differences were more pronounced within trophic guilds than across the whole community, and notably differences in higher order moments (CV, skewness) were relatively greater than differences in the mean of size distributions. In Chapter 2 I evaluated whether such changes in the variance of size distributions affected nutrient recycling independent of the mean. I coupled nutrient recycling incubations and field sampling of habitat-specific size distributions of a non-native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) to scale up nutrient recycling from individuals to aggregate ecosystem functioning using mean-only or variance-incorporating approaches. A mean-only approach overestimated true rates of aggregate nutrient recycling {{by as much as}} 20 % in habitats with low mean body size, but the bias induced by ignoring variance declined with the mean of the distribution. Given that the relationship between individual body size and nutrient recycling is a general representation of many size-functioning relationships, these qualitative results likely hold for other consumer-mediated functions. In Chapter 3 I determined whether body size provided a common <b>functional</b> <b>currency</b> to predict individual nutrient recycling across multiple fish species, and in turn whether native to non-native fish turnover was expected to generate large differences in aggregate nutrient recycling in the Verde River. Body size-recycling models with species-specific parameters were more parsimonious than global models with parameters shared across species. Using species-specific models I found that non-native dominated communities excreted ammonium at similar rates as native-dominated communities, but phosphate at significantly lower rates. The resultant difference in the N:P ratio was surprisingly large, generally independent of body size, and potentially important for aquatic microbial communities in this system. By contrast, the global model incorporating body size but not taxonomy did not capture this significant N:P difference. Together these chapters suggest that quantifying change in body size distributions yields important ecological insights, but taxonomic identity or additional traits are still necessary for a full evaluation of the ecosystem-level effects of multi-species introductions...|$|E
