40|$|The {{current work}} aims at {{modeling}} a three-stage cold <b>heading</b> <b>process</b> of an industrial bolt, and presents a methodology for the optimization of preform die geometries. The process is modeled using finite element simulations and potential defects in the <b>heading</b> <b>process</b> are analyzed using {{external and internal}} crack criteria. The preform geometries are then optimized with respect to external cracking in the blank and forming die load. The conventional Taguchi approach is first applied on each criterion separately. Three optimal solutions are generated. It is found that some parameters have conflicting optimal solutions. The single criterion approach is therefore extended to multiple-criteria approaches {{by the use of}} overall evaluation criteria within the Taguchi method. Two methodologies are proposed, namely, the additive utility function method and the TOPSIS decision-making model. It is found that the performances of the two methods are comparable...|$|E

The effect of some parameters such as teeth number and module on the forming force and material flow were presented. The simulation works were performed rigid-plastic finite element method using DEFORM 3 D software. In order to validate the estimated numerical results, they were compared with those obtained experimentally during heading of spur gear using lead as a model material. Results showed that the optimum number of gear teeth is between 10 to 20, that is because of being the specific pressure in its minimum value.

40|$|Abstract. Size {{effects are}} effects which might occur, if the {{dimensions}} of a forming process are scaled up or down. They might enable or disable {{the application of a}} process in the micro range. Based on the systematic order of size effects, which defines density, shape and structure effects, one example for each group is given. A density effect, which occurs in Tiffany structures, explains the changes in forming behavior of foils with respect to the forming limit diagram. The feasibility of a new <b>heading</b> <b>process</b> only in the micro range is due to a shape effect, driven by the surface energy. The changes in the tribology in deep drawing by a structure effect, known as closed an open lubricant pocket model, can be explained only if one takes the temperature dependence of the viscosity of the lubricant into account...|$|E

40|$|It {{is quite}} {{difficult}} to quantitatively define {{the ability of}} a material to be cold forged. The limit of the forming process is governed by a complicated interplay of such factors as material microstructure, rate of deformation, tool and workpiece geometry and the friction at the interface of the workpiece and tool. The success of a cold forming process is primarily determined by the formability of the stock material. Consistent product quality and increase in productivity requires parts to be plastically deformed without failure. Expensive downtime, tooling damage and material waste are often the consequences of material failure during loading. A means of assessing formability is, therefore, clearly required. A revised upset test is examined, seeking to represent the actual cold <b>heading</b> <b>process</b> and to minimize the effect of test specific factors, such as changing friction at the die-workpiece interface. It is designed to be easily used by industry, requiring minimal sample preparation and the use of a simple and reliable testing device.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} methodology {{to physically}} and numerically model upsetting in cold heading was developed. The physical model was a Drop Weight Test with a guided pocket-die set capable of approximating industrial cold heading conditions. The {{results show that}} the test is sensitive to the critical parameters for cold heading. These include surface quality, residual element level, nitrogen content, microstructure, decarburization, and specimen geometry. The test is capable of assessing the fracture behavior of cold heading materials. One goal {{of the study was to}} reveal differences in fracture behavior with varying steel sources. Accordingly, the matrix of test materials consisted of grade 1038 steels from three different steel sources. Material preparation and conditioning of test materials approximated industrial procedures for cold heading materials. These procedures included hot rolling, controlled rod cooling, descaling, straightening, lime coating and lubricating, and wire drawing. Spheroidization of test specimens was performed in an industrial batch furnace using an industrial heat treatment cycle. A finite element program (FEM) enabled the simulation of upsetting in cold heading. The inputs required to model the cold <b>heading</b> <b>process</b> include flow stress behavior and friction conditions representative of cold heading. These inputs were obtained using the CANMET Cam Plastometer and the Friction Ring Test. The Cockcroft and Latham fracture constants for an as-rolled and a spheroidize annealed 1038 material were computed by FEM modeling and the critical values were calibrated using the Drop Weight Test. The fracture criterion constant was found to be independent of strain path for upsetting in cold heading and thus is material-related...|$|E
40|$|The onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a severe worldwide pest of white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata provar. capitata Duch.) for almost three decades. Although the most effective control measure {{is the use of}} resistant varieties, {{little is known about the}} resistance mechanism(s) involved. In 2007, a study at Tordas, Hungary, was carried out with 6 varieties to confirm that antixenosis is at least partly responsible for the resistance against onion thrips. The number of adult thrips and their progeny was counted on the outer ten head leaves at one-third of the <b>heading</b> <b>process.</b> At the same time, the light reflectance of old and outer head leaves was measured. The onion thrips damage was also assessed at full maturity. Antixenosis was found to be responsible for the resistance of ‘Balashi’, ‘Bloktor’ and ‘Riana’ varieties, since the number of adults and offspring found on head leaves was significantly lower than that of ‘Green gem’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Quisto’. The resistant varieties (‘Balashi’, ‘Bloktor’ and ‘Riana’) similarly suffered significantly lower damage than the susceptible ones (‘Green gem’, ‘Hurricane’ and ‘Quisto’). The light reflectance spectra of all six varieties were almost identical in the case of the old leaves, but a difference was found between the susceptible and resistant varieties when the reflectance of the outer head-forming leaves was measured. Similarly, the colour of the old leaves was not greatly different, but that of the outer head-forming leaves was correlated to the number of thrips adults found in the cabbage heads...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working <b>process.</b> <b>Heading</b> produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two <b>heading</b> <b>processes</b> are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R
