40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{presence}} of fluorine in products (concentrates and <b>tailings)</b> of selective <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> of materials resulting from demolition of electrolytic cells used in aluminium electromining. In fact in a previous work (Ciccu et al. 2009) the possibility of recovering a combustible matter from this wastes using <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> has been studied. In particular the following aspects have been evaluated: · The relationship between F and C contents in flotation products · The need to reduce the content of F in the concentrates for use them as fuels {{in accordance with the}} current national and international laws · The convenience to reduce the content of F in the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> destined to waste deposits. The levels of F assessed in the products suggest to consider the possibility of recovering this element as by-product {{to be used in the}} cement industry. The results show that the presence of F in the products of <b>froth</b> <b>flotation,</b> although being a penalizing element, does not preclude the recovery of this material to be used as fuel, especially if appropriate precautions are taken...|$|R
40|$|Elemental sulfur {{produced}} by chloride leaching of sulfide ores or concentrates contains selenium and tellurium usually {{too high to}} be used in various industrial or agricultural uses. The sulfur in the leaching residue can be upgraded to 90 % in grade by <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> and the sulfur concentration can be followed by sulfur purification and selenium and tellurium removal. The sulfur in the leaching is in a form of discrete particles with a size range of 5 to 10 microns. The sulfur particles tend to agglomerate in the pulp and hence mechanically entrap gangue minerals. With sodium silicate as the dispersant as well as the depressant for siliceous material, a sulfur concentrate of 90 % in grade and 90 % in recovery can be obtained with a single-stage <b>froth</b> <b>flotation.</b> The flotation reagent consumptions are minimum. The majority of chalcopyrite remains in the sulfur <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> and can be readily recovered by flotation with different flotation reagents. When amyl xanthate is used, 85 % of chalcopyrite can be recovered with a copper grade of 14. 5 % in a single-stage <b>froth</b> <b>flotation.</b> The chalcopyrite flotation concentrate can be sent back to chloride leaching circuits...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines to develop flowsheets for the recovery of tungsten and gold from four Alaskan scheelite-bearing ores. Basic gravity concentration and cyanide leach tests were performed on all samples. About 46 pct of the tungsten and 30 pct of the gold from one sample were recovered in a gravity concentrate containing 24 pet W 03 (tungstic oxide) and 119 troy ounces per short ton (tr oz/st) Au. <b>Froth</b> <b>flotation</b> of the gravity concentrate resulted in separate tungsten and gold products with grades of 38 pct W 03 and 2, 720 tr oz/st Au and recoveries of 60 and 97 pet, respectively. Additional gold was recovered from the gravity and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> by cyanidation. Overall recoveries of tungsten and gold from this sample were 28 and 94 pet, respeetively. A flowsheet with mill design parameters was developed that consisted of (1) free gold and scheelite recovery by gravity methods and <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> and (2) fme-grained gold recovery by cyanide leaching of reground gravity and <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings,</b> followed by a carbon-in-pulp (CIP) circuit.

50|$|In general, <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> is {{not used}} to {{concentrate}} copper oxide ores, as oxide minerals are not responsive to the <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> chemicals or process (i.e.; they do not bind to the kerosene-based chemicals). Copper oxide ores have occasionally been treated via <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> via sulfidation of the oxide minerals with certain chemicals which react with the oxide mineral particles to produce a thin rime of sulfide (usually chalcocite), which can then be activated by the <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> plant.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Froth</b> <b>flotation</b> is {{achieved}} by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending {{on the design of}} the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them {{to the surface of the}} flotation cell, where they form a froth. The froth flows over the top edge (or [...] "lip") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings.</b>|$|R

50|$|Foam {{fractionation}} {{is closely}} related to the allied process of <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> in which hydrophobic particles attach to the surface of bubbles which rise to form a pneumatic (i.e. rising) foam.

It was research into the froth phase of <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia, specifically into the prediction of liquid fraction and liquid flux in a pneumatic foam, that enabled a preliminary mechanistic description of foam fractionation.

40|$|This Thesis, {{entitled}} Utilization of <b>Flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> in the Construction Business, {{has been}} formulated and {{developed in the}} Darkov and ČSM Coal Mines. All the findings acquired in the abovementioned mines {{will be used as}} basic information for the future utilization of this fine-grained waste, which is a by-product of black coal processing. While developing and writing this Thesis, I was allowed to observe the processing at both the Darkov and ČSM Coal Mines. The theoretical part of this Thesis is dedicated to the description of processing of black coal, from the moment of extraction to the point of expedition or storage appropriate storage areas. <b>Flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> are composed of fine-grained waste created during flotation processing of black coal. The <b>flotation</b> <b>tailings</b> are deposited (floated) into an assigned depository area - the Pilňok tailings pond.

40|$|Coal, in India and Worldwide, is cleaned {{predominantly}} by {{dense medium}} separations and jigging. But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of fine coals such as mine dust, slack coal, washing rejects and slurries, <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal. In this current project <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> was being carried in a fixed <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> cell used in the laboratory.
