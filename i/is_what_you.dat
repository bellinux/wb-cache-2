The album, What You Need <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Have, The Songs of Roy Harper was being compiled by Laurel Canyon folk singer, musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and was to feature Chris Robinson (the Black Crowes), Gary Louris (the Jayhawks), Johnathan Rice, Eric Johnson (Fruit Bats, the Shins), Benji Hughes, Will Oldham, Andy Cabic, Dawes, Jenny O., Josh Tillman and others. At present, the collection remains unfinished, {{having been delayed}} beyond its planned 2009 release date. Six of the tracks can be heard on the project's Myspace page.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Spa on {{the site}} was built in 1896; which consisted an theatre and seaside pavilion. A fire in 1906 saw the theatre destroyed and a replacement opera house was built in 1907 and still forms {{part of the building}} today. The local authority took control of the buildings in 1914, acquired it in 1919 and rebuilt all but the theatre in 1926. A further fire destroyed these later buildings in 1932 and work started almost immediately to construct their replacement; which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> see today. Bridlington Spa continues to be successfully owned and operated by East Riding of Yorkshire Council.|$|E

25|$|Some early {{examples}} of computer markup languages available outside {{the publishing industry}} {{can be found in}} typesetting tools on Unix systems such as troff and nroff. In these systems, formatting commands were inserted into the document text so that typesetting software could format the text according to the editor's specifications. It was a trial and error iterative process to get a document printed correctly. Availability of WYSIWYG ("what you see <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get") publishing software supplanted much use of these languages among casual users, though serious publishing work still uses markup to specify the non-visual structure of texts, and WYSIWYG editors now usually save documents in a markup-language-based format.|$|E
25|$|Simonyi {{remained}} at Microsoft during its rapid {{rise in the}} software industry, becoming one of its highest-ranking developers. He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program's intended behavior in a What You See <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.|$|E

500|$|The {{difference}} between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase [...] "Climate <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect, weather <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get." [...] Over historical time spans {{there are a}} number of nearly constant variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5°C (9°F) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins. Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{once told}} future Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron that [...] "the game of {{baseball}} is great, but the greatest thing <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do after your career is over." [...] Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957. Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state {{of medicine at the}} time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.|$|E

500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when {{all you know}} about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would make if you never got beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much {{of the film is}} stunning ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Patrizio of IGN {{awarded the}} DVD {{six out of}} ten commenting, [...] "Tom Araya lost his {{piercing}} shriek that opens 'Angel of Death' {{and the end of}} 'Necrophobic'", praising Lombardo's return by saying the drummer [...] "...hasn't lost a step at all. With barely any breathing time between songs, the underground drum legend shows that an impending 40th birthday (next month) isn't going to slow him down." [...] Patrizio stated the production was not of the highest caliber, as the rapid [...] "MTV-style" [...] cuts were distracting, as was the switch from black and white to color shots. Patrizio ended the review with the comment, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get for letting Uwe Boll direct your music video", Boll being a heavily criticized film director.|$|E
