5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> female cicadas {{because they}} have more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> only one prey item per foraging bout, while males often <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return {{to land in}} order to digest their prey.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
