50|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> system {{consists}} of a digital driver card, the tachograph head, and a sender unit mounted to the vehicle gearbox. The sender unit produces electronic pulses as the gearbox output shaft turns. These pulses are interpreted as speed data by the head.|$|E
5000|$|Turkey {{implemented}} the first smart card driver's license system in 1987. Turkey {{had a high}} level of road accidents and decided to develop and use <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> devices on heavy vehicles, instead of the existing mechanical ones, to reduce speed violations. Since 1987, the professional driver's licenses in Turkey have been issued as smart cards. A professional driver is required to insert his driver's license into a <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> before starting to drive. The tachograph unit records speed violations for each driver and gives a printed report. The driving hours for each driver are also being monitored and reported. In 1990 the European Union conducted a feasibility study through BEVAC Consulting Engineers, titled [...] "Feasibility study with respect to a European electronic drivers license (based on a smart-card) on behalf of Directorate General VII". In this study, chapter seven describes Turkey's experience.|$|E

50|$|Fears {{that it is}} easy to falsify {{readings}} by {{tampering with}} tachographs have been allayed, since it is relatively easy to spot such attempts. However, more sophisticated ways to interrupt the signals sent to the <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> have since been created, including the use of magnets. In the UK, DVSA & the police have stepped up their enforcement activities and drivers found to be using a magnet, or any other method, to falsify their drivers hours records are now facing prohibition & fixed penalty notices and/or arrest.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} on-board recorder (EOBR) is {{an electronic}} device {{attached to a}} commercial motor vehicle, {{which is used to}} record the amount of time a vehicle is being driven. This is similar to the tachograph, and is the American equivalent of the <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> used in Europe. Trucks in the European Union are required to have digital tachographs installed, and are securely monitored by government agencies. However, in Europe, the new <b>digital</b> <b>tachograph</b> which is considered secure, can be tricked with a round magnet placed by drivers over the connection to the transmission box. Usually they tie a rope to that magnet, and with a simple pull, the magnet will disengage and will show that the driver started moving about half an hour ago (or whatever time the driver wants to set by stopping in a rest area after a sleeping period, and place the magnet on).The majority of carriers and drivers in the United States currently use paper-based log books. On January 31, 2011, the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) proposed a rule requiring Electronic On-Board Recorders for interstate commercial truck and bus companies. The proposed rule covers interstate carriers that currently use log books to record driver's hours of service. The proposal would affect more than 500,000 carriers in the United States and carriers that currently use time cards would be exempt.|$|E

30|$|For new {{automotive}} {{applications and}} services, information technology (IT) has gained central importance. IT-related costs in car manufacturing are already high {{and they will}} increase dramatically in the future. Yet whereas safety and reliability have become a relatively well-established field, the protection of vehicular IT systems against systematic manipulation or intrusion has only recently started to emerge. Nevertheless, IT security is already the base of some vehicular applications such as immobilizers or <b>digital</b> <b>tachographs.</b> To securely enable future automotive applications and business models, IT security {{will be one of}} the central technologies for the next generation of vehicles. After a state-of-the-art overview of IT security in vehicles, we give a short introduction into cryptographic terminology and functionality. This contribution will then identify the need for automotive IT security while presenting typical attacks, resulting security objectives, and characteristic constraints within the automotive area. We will introduce core security technologies and relevant security mechanisms followed by a detailed description of critical vehicular applications, business models, and components relying on IT security. We conclude our contribution with a detailed statement about challenges and opportunities for the automotive IT community for embedding IT security in vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Civilian GNSS based near-real-time {{tracking}} systems are presently {{used in a}} number of fields, such as the fisheries Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), the maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS), the transportation of dangerous goods, in Mobile Asset Management, and in Law Enforcement. Projected toll road billing systems, ¿pay as you go¿ car insurances, and revised <b>digital</b> <b>tachographs</b> are other candidates for GNSS tracking. These devices record and report their positions. Transmissions usually occur in an expedient manner, implying near real time. The reporting intervals are determined by the application domain. The tracker sends its position messages to a public or commercial organisation that analyses such messages. Therefore, nearly all such trackers are composed of a GNSS receiver module and a wireless communications module for transmission of positions. Every such GNSS-based tracker is vulnerable to tampering, and gains from tampering depend on the application domain. This paper is concerned with surreptitious introduction of false tracking information, and the mitigation of such risk. Modelling such trackers, one identifies multiple ways that an adversary could use to introduce such false information. With sufficient development work on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform, an adversary could engineer an illegal civilian GPS spoofer that circumvents classical GPS receiver integrity checks. The intelligent abuse of SDR can also spoof the outgoing position message. Furthermore, trackers constitute embedded computing systems that have input/output ports, begetting vulnerability. If trackers use cryptography to authenticate their outgoing message, they can be subjected to ¿side channel attacks¿. Last but not least, it is possible to physically tamper with the tracker. Physical tampering includes breaching the housing of the tracker, and removing the tracker from the asset. Various options are reviewed to harden GNSS based trackers against diverse technological exploits. The paper assumes that an intact tracker is properly installed, and does not cover social engineering. The introductory chapter defines an abstract GNSS tracker. The first chapter investigates countermeasures to GNSS spoofing and meaconing. The second chapter discusses physical sealing vulnerabilities and mitigation. The third chapter shows how communications security can be improved, specifically for low bandwidth satellite communications. The fourth chapter explores aspects of side channel attacks and computer security. The conclusion presents possible architectures for secured GNSS trackers {{that could be used in}} some application domains. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Tachograph</b> is {{a regulatory}} instrument (mandatory by Council Regulation since 1 st May 2006) {{to enforce the}} application of social regulations in road transport especially with the view to increase traffic safety. It records the work and the rest times of drivers {{as well as the}} vehicle speed over time with the aim to ensure that appropriate rest periods are taken by drivers and that a maximum of permissible speed is not exceeded. The original and prime functionality of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Tachograph</b> is to document, i. e. to record, the driving history of a driver and his vehicle. Nevertheless controls by the road safety authorities are rather inefficient while time-consuming. The proposed update to the existing regulation would rather guarantee the <b>Digital</b> <b>Tachograph</b> as a compliance device rather than as an accurate recorder of driving history. Basic innovation is the application of short range communication technologies (like RFID) allowing the road authorities to scan by-passing vehicles and thus increasing the throughput by the order of ten.
