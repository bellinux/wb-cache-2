500|$|The Symphonic Fantasies album {{garnered}} universal praise {{upon its}} release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan {{said that it}} was [...] "the best game music arranged album of 2010. It may be the best in years, with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR." [...] Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version called it [...] "the best symphonic game arrangement CD you can <b>get</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on," [...] and further added [...] "for every game music fan out there, especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix, this is the definitive pick for you." [...] Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10, and stated that it [...] "offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix" [...] and [...] "certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation." [...] Benjamin Schmädig of the German site 4players.de said of the album [...] "Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments. The orchestra and choir put in all their strength, all their subtlety in these moments." [...] He further complimented Jonne Valtonen, saying that he [...] "knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch." [...] Denis Brown of the German site OnlineWelten said that for Square Enix fans, it is an obligatory purchase.|$|E

2500|$|Moore's most lauded {{work was}} for Supreme. Taking over {{initially}} with #41 (#49 {{was the first}} to bear the [...] "Awesome" [...] imprint), Moore deconstructed and reconstructed the core character (and his supporting cast) from a relatively generic superhero, into a glowing tribute to the Mort Weisinger-era of Superman. Featuring both comics and social commentary and both general and specific tributes to aspects of comics history, Supreme received much critical praise, with Entertainment Weekly, for example, calling a Supreme collection a [...] "graphic novel you really oughta <b>get</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on".|$|E

2500|$|PC Zone hailed it as [...] "one {{of the few}} {{games that}} {{has the power to}} engage your {{imagination}} with pretty pictures, then actually live up to your imaginings when you <b>get</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> on it". and GameZone gave it [...] "Editor's Choice", calling it [...] "a bona fide winner". However, GameSpy asked [...] "How much slack can you give a game that in many ways manages to achieve [...] lofty goal, but buries it under a painfully incomplete implementation?". Reviewers complained of low frame rates, frequent crashes, and bugs that made it impossible to complete the game; [...] "the game was simply unplayable out of the box". [...] "t's not that X3 is a bad game, or that it isn't fun - it just isn't done." [...] Complaints were also made about its complicated interface, exacerbated by an unhelpful manual which references [...] "features and options that aren't even in the final version".|$|E

2500|$|The CWAC {{had many}} jobs with {{different}} uniforms. A canteen worker could wear overalls, a radioman could wear the battledress trousers and the battledress jacket (most common). Uniforms came {{in many different}} forms. Home front women usually wore dress skirts (or trousers) and round hats. If it was a job that meant <b>getting</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> dirty, such as working on an engine of an airplane or vehicle, they would wear normal hardy clothing.
