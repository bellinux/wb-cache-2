40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that speakers of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> languages consider <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrary, but this assumption {{has never been}} tested. Research shows that the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of nouns can affect perceptions of the masculinity or femininity of the noun's referent in speakers of languages with masculine and feminine noun classes. However, bilingualism facilitates the development of lexical arbitrariness awareness, and could therefore affect awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness. This study then compared three groups of young adult speakers of a <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language: monolinguals, early bilinguals, and instructed second language learners. Participants evaluated the gender assignments of 25 nouns of entities (animals, abstract concepts, natural kinds, and artefacts), and answered open and closed questions about <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Participants considered <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as semantically motivated and mostly related gender assignments to perceived masculine or feminine connotations of referents. Knowledge of an additional <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language was linked to increased awareness of the arbitrariness of first language gender assignments in both early bilinguals and later instructed learners. It is argued that <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> awareness deserves further investigation. Knowing more than one <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> language can increase awareness of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> arbitrariness.

40|$|<b>Grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French {{language}} {{is one of}} the biggest guessing games for a native English speaker. Why a table is feminine and a book is masculine is a question that plagues those learning French as a second language. In French, all nouns have gender, masculine and feminine. The complication: only a small percentage of the nouns are assigned gender semantically leaving the remaining which are assigned gender seemingly arbitrarily. For English native speakers, the distinction of these basic parts in a foreign {{language is}} not a natural skill. The simple fact that nouns are either feminine or masculine is troubling to students of the French language. This struggle of the English native speaker with French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> presents a valuable opportunity to study how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. This project is a study of French <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> acquisition of English native speakers. First, it examines the existing methods by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is acquired. The research then contrasts the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in second language learning to the acquisition for native French speakers. This paper then factors in the different variables that affect how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is learned as a second language. These variables include age, level of French, motivation, type and amount of explicit review, and positive and negative feedback. I created a survey of students from high school French levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 asking them to identify the gender of a series of French nouns, some of which can be determined by gender by general rules, some exceptions, and nouns that are typically used within various contexts. This project summarizes the results as well as compares them to the students’ responses to the following: How did you learn to decide between masculine and feminine nouns? How do you feel about how well you can distinguish M/F? and What do you know about masculine and feminine nouns in French? This research summarizes the pedagogy surrounding <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and its effectiveness. Processing this study thus acts as a chance to improve personal acuity with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> Furthermore, it provides a guide for how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French to students. Along with the research, I provide general curricula of how to communicate <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in the French foreign language classroom. This is accompanied by complete lesson plans highlighting <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> as either a focus completely on masculine vs feminine nouns, a review or frontloading activity. This paper and curricula represent the attempt to understand the many facets in the acquisition of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in order to apply a knowledgeable approach to the instruction of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French...|$|R

Its goal is, through carrying out an experiment on Czech language (that means on a language with <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> and on Hungarian language (that means on a language without <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender)</b> to verify the assumption, that the Czech native speakers would focus on the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> while responding, unlike the Hungarian native speakers, whose language does not have <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender.</b> For this purpose, two methods are used.

40|$|Aims and objectives/purpose/{{research}} questions: This article reviews {{recent research}} on how speaking a language that marks gender grammatically might affect thinking, and {{on the relationship between}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> knowledge of more than one language, and thinking, in both early and emergent bilinguals. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a comprehensive review of previous research, as well as an introduction to, and an evaluation of, the articles in this special issue. Findings/conclusions: Several themes emerge in the research on <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and thinking in bilinguals. First, knowledge of more than one language could reduce the effects of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> on thinking. Second, these effects may depend on the combination of languages being acquired. Third, researchers are starting to identify other variables that might affect when and how <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> influences thinking, including proficiency and the choice of tasks. Originality: This manuscript synthesises the previously scattered research on <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> and thinking in bilinguals.

40|$|Linguists and non-linguists alike {{have long}} {{considered}} <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> to be arbitrary. For the most part, only some very general tendencies governing <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment {{have been suggested}} {{in the face of}} the prevalent anomalist approaches to gender theory. However, these anomalist views of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> assignment offer no explanation for very basic questions about this aspect of language. First, how do native speaking children of languages with <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> learn a system with little or no trouble that via pure memorization would take years of concerted study to master? Second, how can native speakers almost unanimously agree on gender assignment for new loan words coming into the language?The answer to these questions is that there must be some underlying system by which <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> is assigned to nouns in a given language. The present paper uses two principles, gender eclipsis and gender tally, to postulate rules for the assignment of <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in Modern Swedish. The purpose of the research is to display the systematicity found in the gender system of Swedish and to argue further against the anomalist theory of gender assignment in all languages. 1. 0 An overview of grammatical sender theory and researchGrammatical gender has long been a topic of great speculation in most fields of linguistic studies.

I focus on several specific linguistic structures and uses of particular words in these two languages. I particularly deal with the construction of a third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> the neuter, in Romanian, in comparison to the two <b>grammatical</b> <b>genders</b> existing in French, trying to see how the application of Irigaray&iacute;s theory on the gender of nouns functions for Romanian language. There is no third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> in French, and therefore Irigaray&iacute;s argument is proved to be invalid for Romanian. The questions that lead my analysis are: What corporeality does the third <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender,</b> the neuter in Romanian, point to? How are we to consider neuter words? Is the neuter a necessary and sufficient proof for considering Romanian a less sexist lan- guage? Is the neuter the guarantor of impartiality and equilibrium in a grammatically gendered language...|$|R

We designed three different types of context: Epicene-Incongruent contexts (i. e., contexts containing a gender bias that differed from the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> of epicenes), Epicene-Congruent contexts (i. e., contexts where the two gender levels coincide) and Neutral contexts. For epicenes, pronoun resolution was driven by the <b>grammatical</b> <b>gender</b> marked in the epicene’s representation. For bi-genders, pronoun resolution was driven by the gender assigned by context. The results are discussed in the light of current models of anaphor resolution...|$|R
