5|$|Now {{possessing}} three powers, Delsin encounters Hank, who {{has escaped}} again. Hank tells Delsin that <b>Fetch</b> and Eugene have been {{captured by the}} D.U.P., and are being held on an artificial concrete island in Puget Sound. However, the situation {{turns out to be}} a trap set by Augustine. Reggie appears and rescues Delsin with a rocket launcher. While the brothers free <b>Fetch</b> and Eugene, Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death. Distraught and enraged, Delsin climbs back up onto the platform and battles Augustine, destroying the entire island.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Instruction <b>fetching</b> is {{critical}} to the performance of a superscalar microprocessor. We develop a mathematical model for three different cache techniques and evaluate its performance both in theory and in simulation using the SPEC 95 suite of benchmarks. In all the techniques, the <b>fetching</b> performance is dramatically lower than ideal expectations. To help remedy the situation, we also evaluate its performance using prefetching. Nevertheless, <b>fetching</b> performance is fundamentally limited by control transfers. To solve this problem, we introduce a new <b>fetching</b> mechanism called a dual branch target buffer. The dual branch target buffer enables <b>fetching</b> performance to leap beyond the limitation imposed by conventional methods and achieve a high instruction <b>fetching</b> rate. Index Terms—Computer architecture, instruction <b>fetching,</b> superscalar microprocessor, performance analysis, branch target buffer. ————————— — F —————————...|$|R
30|$|To {{access the}} {{contents}} stored at local caches, the content <b>fetching</b> delay, i.e., the time duration required for searching the contents in the cache should be considered. In general, content <b>fetching</b> delay may {{vary depending on}} the types of storage devices, the underlying file searching mechanisms, and the amount of caching contents. Referring to [20], we model the content <b>fetching</b> delay as an exponentially distributed random variable and denote D_ijk^ca as the average content <b>fetching</b> delay required when UE j <b>fetching</b> file k from GAP i.|$|R
5|$|At E3 2014, the DLC package Infamous First Light was {{announced}} {{and was released}} on August 26, 2014 in North America and August 27, 2014 in Europe. In First Light, the player controls <b>Fetch.</b> It is a stand-alone expansion and Second Son {{is not required to}} play the game, but ownership of Second Son grants players access to exclusive content. Infamous First Light received mixed to positive reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to <b>fetch</b> medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|If Delsin has evil Karma, {{he kills}} Augustine and, {{together}} with <b>Fetch</b> and Eugene, takes control of Seattle. He releases {{all of the}} imprisoned Conduits and absorbs their powers. Upon returning to the reservation, Delsin is met by a wheelchair-bound Betty who banishes him from the tribe for the killings in Seattle. Shocked and angered, Delsin destroys the entire reservation.|$|E

5|$|If Delsin {{has good}} Karma, he spares Augustine and exposes her crimes to the world. She is arrested and the D.U.P. disbands. Delsin, <b>Fetch</b> and Eugene {{convince}} the humans {{that they can}} peacefully coexist with the Conduits. All of the imprisoned Conduits are freed. Delsin returns to the reservation and heals the tribe members, then paints a mural dedicated to Reggie.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, a secondhand {{dealer in}} Kyoto {{contacted}} Natsuki Matsumoto, {{an expert in}} iconography at the Osaka University of Arts. The dealer had obtained a collection of films and projectors from an old Kyoto family, and Matsumoto arrived the next month to <b>fetch</b> them. The collection included three projectors, eleven 35mm films, and thirteen glass magic lantern slides.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player can examine and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} <b>fetch</b> quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E
50|$|When a {{next line}} {{predictor}} points to aligned groups of 2, 4 or 8 instructions, the branch target will usually {{not be the}} first instruction <b>fetched,</b> and so the initial instructions <b>fetched</b> are wasted. Assuming for simplicity a uniform distribution of branch targets, 0.5, 1.5, and 3.5 instructions <b>fetched</b> are discarded, respectively.|$|R
50|$|When Horizontal {{scrolling}} {{is enabled}} for a mode line ANTIC <b>fetches</b> the next size increment {{greater than the}} current screen width to provide the buffer of data subject to the horizontal scrolling control. When displaying Narrow width ANTIC <b>fetches</b> the screen RAM needed for Normal width. Likewise, for Normal width ANTIC <b>fetches</b> the screen RAM needed for Wide.|$|R
50|$|Note that <b>fetching</b> {{from two}} {{half-size}} banks of SRAM will dissipate {{more power than}} <b>fetching</b> from one full-size bank, as it causes more switching in the sense amps and data steering logic.|$|R
5|$|Size {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind <b>fetch,</b> longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.|$|E
5|$|The Wyatt {{revolver}} from Boyer's {{estate was}} expected to <b>fetch</b> from $100,000 and $150,000. On {{the day of the}} auction, more than 6,400 online bidders and over 400 collectors from 49 countries took part in the auction. The revolver attributed to Wyatt Earp was sold to an unnamed phone bidder from New Mexico for $225,000. The Winchester lever-action shotgun also said to be Wyatt Earp's sold for $50,000, below the high value estimate of $125,000.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{and analyze the}} effect of age on the {{performance}} of various cache configurations. We consider a low-level cache that <b>fetches</b> objects either from their origin servers or from other caches and analyze its miss rate as function of its <b>fetching</b> policy. We distinguish between three basic <b>fetching</b> policies, namely, <b>fetching</b> always from the origin, <b>fetching</b> always from the same high-level cache, and <b>fetching</b> from a &quot;random &quot; high-level cache. We explore the relationships between these policies in terms of the miss rate achieved by the low-level cache, both on worst-case sequences, and on sequences generated using particular distributions. Guided by web caching practice, we consider two variations of the basic policies. In the first variation the high-level cache uses pre-term refreshes to keep a copy with lower age. In the second variation the low-level cache uses extended lifetime duration. We analyze how these variations affect the miss rates. Our theoretical results help to understand how age may affect the miss rate, and imply guidelines for improving performance of web caches...|$|R

5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much of the work that ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea. He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to <b>fetch</b> help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Temenggong {{delegated}} Abu Bakar, then an eighteen-year-old youth, {{to assist}} him in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali, who was making frivolous attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor. As the Temenggong aged, he gradually delegated his state administrative duties to Abu Bakar. During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar's excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier's diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to <b>fetch</b> Tengku Teh, {{the mother of the}} deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang.|$|E

5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved <b>fetch</b> quests, fishing and farming.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right gunner was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} gunner would <b>fetch</b> the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} two enhancements to the AFS distributed {{file system}} intended {{to improve the}} performance of large file <b>fetches</b> over high-speed networks. Selective caching AFS bypasses the client local disk when <b>fetching</b> files, which improves the performance of applications such as streaming video, for which local caching is of little benefit, and gives client processor and cache resources to applications for which local caching is an advantage. Split-path AFS augments the conventional UDP-based connection between AFS client and server with a "fast path" over native ATM AAL 5 for file data <b>fetches.</b> These enhancements combine to reduce the elapsed time of large (100 MB) file <b>fetches</b> by 80 % in our laboratory environment...|$|R
