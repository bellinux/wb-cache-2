In the preface to his 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of Scott's team on the Terra Nova Expedition, wrote: [...] "For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> devil of a hole and {{want to get out of}} it, give me Shackleton every time".|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E
500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B. Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E

500|$|The consistory {{court had}} awarded the prosecution's costs against Davidson, who now faced {{enormous}} legal bills {{and had no}} regular source of income. His only recourse was to return to Blackpool and resume {{his career as a}} showman; this became his milieu for the next four years, interrupted by occasional prosecutions for obstruction and a nine-day spell in prison in 1933, for non-payment of rent owing to one of his former London landladies. He informed the press: [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case". Although the barrel act remained his staple performance, he introduced variations over the years: freezing in a refrigerated chamber, or being roasted in a glass-fronted oven while a mechanised devil prodded him with a pitchfork. In August 1935 the freezing routine led to Davidson's arrest and prosecution for attempted suicide; he won the case and was awarded £382 damages for false imprisonment. How much money Davidson made from his various acts is uncertain; Tucker believes that the main financial beneficiary was his agent, Luke Gannon.|$|E
500|$|As {{negotiations}} went {{on during}} the legislative session, Dayton suggested compromise budget frameworks ultimately reducing his proposed budget to $35.8 billion, but insisted {{that he would go}} no further and that Republicans were not amenable enough to compromise. The legislature passed budget bills that balanced the budget with significant cuts to social and infrastructure services, rather than raising any taxes. They described their budget as a compromise with the DFL after the state's revenue forecast was revised upward, as it called for $34 billion in state spending increased from $32 billion. Dayton claimed that the impasse was the doing of [...] "extreme right-wing" [...] freshman Republican legislators whom he did not talk to, and that he had cordial relationships with Republican leaders. In a statement {{at the end of the}} session on May 23, Dayton said [...] "Here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle — and they haven't moved". Republicans, including Koch and other legislative leaders, consistently insisted they would not accept a budget of over $34 billion, citing polls suggesting public opinion was on their side. During the session, the Republican Party held a rally calling for tax cuts at the State Capitol on May 7. Protesters supporting Dayton's tax increases and opposed to the Republicans, many from public employee unions, gathered at the capitol multiple times, including at the end of the session.|$|E

500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E
