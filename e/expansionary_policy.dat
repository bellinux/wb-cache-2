25|$|Peter Temin an {{economist}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains a tariff is an <b>expansionary</b> <b>policy,</b> like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP {{in the next two years}} and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small.|$|E

According to Ibn Khaldun, [...] "he was the bravest, most dreaded and honorable man of the 'Abd-la-Wadid family. No one looked after the interest of his people, maintained the influence of the kingdom and managed the state administration better than he did." [...] Before his death he instructed his son and heir Uthman to remain on the defensive with the Marinid kingdom, but to expand into Hafsid territory if possible. Under Yaghmurasen's leadership, and later under Abu Hammu II (1359–89), the kingdom pursued an <b>expansionary</b> <b>policy,</b> pushing towards Fez in the west and into the Chelif valley and Béjaïa in the east.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a dilemma}} {{as to whether}} these two {{policies}} are complementary, or act as substitutes {{to each other for}} achieving macroeconomic goals. Policy makers are viewed as interacting as strategic substitutes when one <b>policy</b> maker's <b>expansionary</b> (contractionary) <b>policies</b> are countered by another <b>policy</b> maker's contractionary (<b>expansionary)</b> <b>policies.</b> For example: if the fiscal authority raises taxes or cuts spending, then the monetary authority reacts to it by lowering the policy rates and vice versa. If they behave as strategic complements, then an <b>expansionary</b> (contractionary) <b>policy</b> of one authority is met by <b>expansionary</b> (contractionary) <b>policies</b> of the other.|$|R

40|$|This paper reexamines {{the effect}} of <b>expansionary</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> on real GDP in the {{presence}} of entrepreneurship, which is defined as firms' activities to predict and adapt to changes in consumers' tastes. As government expenditure cannot reflect changes in consumers' tastes, it weakens the social role of the firms' ability to process local information for predicting the changes. Hence, government expenditure cannot perfectly substitute for private consumption. It is shown that <b>expansionary</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> can lower real GDP when idiosyncratic risk and the substitutability of goods are large, and when firms have a strong ability to predict changes in consumer tastes. In addition, this paper shows that <b>expansionary</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> discourages firms from investing in activities that aid prediction in the short run.

50|$|Monetary {{policy is}} {{referred}} to as either being expansionary or contractionary. <b>Expansionary</b> <b>policy</b> is when a monetary authority uses its tools to stimulate the economy. An <b>expansionary</b> <b>policy</b> increases the total supply of money in the economy more rapidly than usual. It is traditionally used to try to combat unemployment in a recession by lowering interest rates in the hope that easy credit will entice businesses into expanding. Also, this increases the aggregate demand (the overall demand for all goods and services in an economy), which boosts growth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Expansionary monetary policy usually diminishes the value of the currency, thereby decreasing the exchange rate.|$|E

50|$|Since in the Keynesian view, recessions {{are caused}} by {{inadequate}} aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government should {{increase the amount of}} aggregate demand and bring the economy back into equilibrium.

50|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is called the}} firm balance-sheet effects because it works through the effect on stock prices on the firm’s balance sheet. <b>Expansionary</b> <b>policy</b> rises the stock prices of the firm, which increases the net worth of the company.

This again leads to a higher output of the economy. ↑ M → ↑ stock price → ↑ NW → ↑ L → ↑ I → ↑ Y.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, it can {{be argued}} that when <b>expansionary</b> <b>policy</b> rises the stock prices, it {{automatically}} also rises the value of the financial wealth of a household and consumption will increase.

This theory states that an important component of consumer’s lifetime resources are stocks and that stocks therefore are an important determinant for consumption. ↑ M → ↑ stock price → ↑ W → ↑ C → ↑ Y, where W is the financial wealth of a household.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the impacts of <b>expansionary</b> {{monetary}} <b>policies</b> executed by the Federal Reserve on poverty in the United States of America. It has been discussed in various studies that the Fed’s <b>expansionary</b> monetary <b>policies</b> create a less positive impact on {{economy as a whole}} than financial sector. In this study, the expansionary effects of <b>expansionary</b> <b>policies</b> on the poor living in America will be discussed. The main thesis of the study is that the poor living in the United States benefited less from <b>expansionary</b> monetary <b>policies</b> than either financial sector or the US economy as a whole. When discussing the thesis of the study both employed and unemployed poor will be discussed. Therefore, it will be questioned that the decrease in the unemployment rate is the indicator of the fight against poverty. Indicators such as indices and interest rates in the financial markets, and indicators such as growth rates and unemployment rates in the overall economy are regarded as essential indicators but as for poverty it’s hard to find such regarded indicators. Unfortunately, there are not too many statistics about the poor living in the United States in the reports of the international organizations. Thus the main trouble of the study is that international comparisons are almost impossible. Therefore, various indicators produced by the U. S. government agencies of various indicators will be used in this study...|$|R

5000|$|Since the short-run curve shifts outward due to {{the attempt}} to reduce unemployment, the <b>expansionary</b> <b>policy</b> {{ultimately}} worsens the exploitable tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That is, it results in more inflation at each short-run unemployment rate.

With the actual rate equal to it, inflation is stable, neither accelerating nor decelerating. One practical use of this model was to provide an explanation for stagflation, which confounded the traditional Phillips curve.|$|E
