5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is related to their appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

5|$|In 1444, Skanderbeg {{had managed}} to unite the major Albanian princes under his {{leadership}} at the League of Lezhë, where a confederation of all the Albanian Principalities was created. Stresses within the alliance were <b>felt,</b> <b>when</b> Nicholas Dukagjini, {{a member of the}} Dukagjini family, a powerful family in northern Albania, ambushed and killed Lekë Zaharia Altisferi, prince of Dagnum and also League member. Since Zaharia had no children, he organized the killing to more easily gain Dagnum. The year in which Zaharia was killed is not recorded. A Venetian document dated to 4 January 1445, mentions Zaharia as the once lord of Dagnum which was given to Boxia, Zaharia's mother. The Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno says that Zaharia was killed close to the advent of the year 1445.|$|E
5|$|It later {{emerged that}} Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland {{a seat on}} the Supreme Court, and was waiting in the {{expectation}} that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft <b>felt,</b> <b>when</b> he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as president and chief justice.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E

25|$|Wool may be spun {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause <b>felting.</b> <b>When</b> done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap.|$|R

25|$|In January 2017, The A.V. Club posted an {{analysis}} of the scene where Zev meets the character John Kurlander. The review noted some surface-level similarities between Norris' work as John and his role as Hank Schrader on Breaking Bad, but its main focus was on how events in 2016 and growing vocalization of white supremacists served to make the scene much more disturbing and realistic than it <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> the film premiered in 2015.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} themes of the play is the effect social change has on people. The {{emancipation}} of the serfs on 19 February 1861 by Alexander II allowed former serfs to gain wealth and status while some aristocrats were becoming impoverished, unable to tend their estates without the cheap labor of slavery. The effect of these reforms was still being <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> Chekhov was writing forty years after the mass emancipation.|$|E

25|$|The metacognitive {{perspective}} views TOT states {{simply as}} the awareness <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> such an event occurs {{and the perception of}} the experience involved. Mainly being aware of a TOT state can result in the rapid devotion of cognitive resources to resolving the state and successfully retrieving the word from memory. Such an explanation leaves much to be desired; however, the psycholinguistic perspective and the metacognitive perspective on TOT states are not mutually exclusive and both are used to observe TOT states in a laboratory setting.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} vary {{depending}} on the type of hernia. Symptoms may or may not be present in some inguinal hernias. In the case of reducible hernias, a bulge in the groin or in another abdominal area can often be seen and <b>felt.</b> <b>When</b> standing, such a bulge becomes more obvious. Besides the bulge, other symptoms include pain in the groin that may also include a heavy or dragging sensation, and in men, there is sometimes pain and swelling in the scrotum around the testicular area.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} of ATG {{can easily be}} seen not only during day-night-day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low light to high light conditions (above 1 lx), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> using a weapon sight which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures taken at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain “eyes on target”.|$|E
25|$|The {{motives of}} the murder were not made clear during the trial. Was it a satanic crime, one of the human sacrifices that the MLO members had talked about? Or was it rather a hate crime, {{motivated}} by the anger Nödtveidt and Vlad had <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> confronted with Meddour's personality? According to criminal inspector Lars Ohlin, who led the police investigation, {{there is no denying}} that Nödtveidt and Vlad's acts were made on a background of Satanism, but homophobia was also a clear factor, and the Keillers Park murder was registered as a hate crime by the Swedish police.|$|E

50|$|Washing {{the wool}} {{at this stage}} can be a tedious process. Some people wash it a small handful at a time very carefully, and then set it out to dry {{on a table in}} the sun.

If the fleece gets agitated, it will become felt, and then {{spinning}} is impossible. <b>Felting,</b> <b>when</b> done on purpose (with needles, chemicals, or simply rubbing the fibres against each other), can be used to create garments.|$|R

25|$|Radiance, a synthetic, {{laboratory}} produced {{solution containing}} calcium hydroxylapatite (bone) suspended in a gel {{that has been}} safely used in medicine for years.

But the substance produced results for an average of two years with a few patients reporting the plumping effects being sustained as long as three to five years. Of the 90 patients, four required surgical intervention due to nodules in the lips.|$|E
25|$|This {{liaison with}} Mboya would cause ripples in the Kenyatta Government. In fact, so {{suspicious}} was the regime that despite Khasakhala's seniority in Western Province, Kenyatta opted to give Ministerial slots to Masinde Muliro and James Osogo, {{and the less}} colorful James Otiende fearing that this rising star would be a thorn in {{the flesh of the}} Cabinet. In 1966 when then Vice President Odinga had fallen out of grace, Mboya organised the famous Limuru Conference which saw eight regional Vice Presidents being elected representing each Province. Mboya's influence would be <b>felt</b> <b>when</b> he ensured the election of his comrades including Khasakhala, Moi, Nyagah, Ngala, Kibaki, Sagini among others. Khasakhala remained a loyal friend and confidant of Tom Mboya. It is noted historically that Khasakhala and Kibaki are remembered as some of the only brave government officials who attended and were welcomed to Mboya's tense Funeral at Rising Island in 1969.|$|E
