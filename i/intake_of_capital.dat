We assessed the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in 100 Finnish men consuming their habitual omnivorous diet, and measured the 24 h urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans to compare the intake and metabolism. Dietary determinants <b>of</b> lignan <b>intake</b> and their urinary excretion were also determined. The mean <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans was 1224 (SD 539) mg/d, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol covered 78 %. Almost half (47 %) <b>of</b> the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans was explained by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> rye products, berries, coffee, tea and roots. The urinary excretion of plant lignans corresponded to 17 % and enterolignans to 92 % <b>of</b> the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lignans. The urinary excretion of plant lignans was explained 14 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> rye products and <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> coffee, and consequently 3 – 7 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> water-insoluble fibre. The urinary excretion of enterolactone was explained 11 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and rye products, 14 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> water-soluble fibre and only 4 % by the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> lariciresinol.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that morphine causes a selective increase in the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> dietary fat.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given ad lib access to separate sources of carbohydrate, fat and protein (Experiment 1), or to a carbohydrate/protein and a fat/protein diet (Experiment 2). After daily baseline <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> the diets were determined, all rats were tested for feeding responses to subcutaneous injections of morphine (0, 2 and 10 mg/kg).

Generally, morphine increased carbohydrate intake in carbohydrate-preferring rats, and increased fat intake in fat-preferring rats.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Results of {{epidemiological}} studies relating individual dietary factors to {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are inconsistent. To evaluate the cross sectional association of dietary factors with pulmonary function, {{data were collected}} from middle aged men in three European countries.  METHODS—The data were collected in the 1960 s in Finland (n = 1248), Italy (n = 1386), and the Netherlands (n = 691). Dietary intake was estimated using the cross-check dietary history method. Forced expiratory volume (FEV 0. 75 or FEV 1, here called FEV) was measured by spirometry. Associations were adjusted for age, height, smoking, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and energy intake.  RESULTS—FEV was positively associated with <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> vitamin E in Finland, with <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> fruit in Italy, and with <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> β-carotene in the Netherlands. In all three countries men with <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> both fruit and vegetables above the median had a higher FEV than those with a low <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> both foods. The difference in FEV ranged from 110 to 169 ml before and from 53 to 118 ml after energy adjustment. Differences in FEV for <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> three antioxidants (vitamins C and E and β-carotene) above versus below the median ranged from 61 to 181 ml before and from - 35 to 58 ml after energy adjustment. <b>Intake</b> <b>of</b> fish was not associated with FEV.  CONCLUSIONS—In three European countries a high <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> fruit and vegetables was positively associated with pulmonary function. A high <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> all three antioxidants tended to be positively associated with pulmonary function before, but not after, adjustment for energy <b>intake.</b> Associations <b>of</b> individual antioxidants with pulmonary function were not consistent across countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patients with {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) often relate symptoms to the <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> certain foods.

Out of 11078 invited subjects, 4621 completed a survey about abdominal complaints and <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> common food items. IBS and IBS subgroups were classified according to Rome II criteria. Results IBS was diagnosed in 388 subjects (8. 4 %) and, of these, 26. 5 % had constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 44. 8 % alternating IBS (A-IBS), and 28. 6 % diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). Low <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> dairy products (portions/day) (Odds Ratio 0. 85 [CI 0. 78 to 0. 93], p[*] = [*] 0. 001) and high <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> water (100 [*]ml/day) (1. 08 [1. 02 to 1. 15], p[*] = [*] 0. 002), tea (1. 05 [1. 01 to 1. 10], p[*] = [*] 0. 019) and carbonated beverages (1. 07 [1. 01 to 1. 14], p[*] = [*] 0. 023) were associated with IBS.

To compare dietary <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> people with CD to the dietary <b>intake</b> <b>of</b> the general population.
