50|$|Stinkpots {{are small}} black, grey or brown turtles with highly domed shells. They grow to {{approximately}} 5.1 - 14 cm and average in weight at 603 g. They have long necks and rather short legs. The yellow {{lines on the}} neck are a good <b>field</b> <b>marker,</b> and often {{can be seen from}} above in swimming turtles. Males can usually be distinguished from females by their significantly longer tails and by the spike that protrudes {{at the end of the}} tail. The anal vent on the underside of the tail extends out beyond the plastron on males. Females are also typically larger than males. The head is vaguely triangular in shape, with a pointed snout and sharp beak, and yellow-green striping from the tip of the nose to the neck. Barbels are present on the chin and the throat. Their plastrons are relatively small, offering little protection for the legs, and have only one transverse, anterior hinge. Algae often grow on their carapaces. Their tiny tongues are covered in bud-like papillae that allow them to respire underwater.|$|E

40|$|Retina {{formation}} {{requires the}} correct spatiotemporal patterning of key regulatory factors. While {{it is known}} that repression of several signaling pathways lead to specification of retinal fates, addition of only Noggin, a known BMP antagonist, can convert pluripotent Xenopus laevis animal cap cells to functional retinal cells. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the intracellular molecular events that occur during this conversion. Surprisingly, blocking BMP signaling alone failed to mimic Noggin treatment. Overexpressing Noggin in pluripotent cells resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of both Smad 1 and Smad 2 phosphorylation, which act downstream of BMP and Activin signaling, respectively. This caused a decrease in downstream targets: endothelial marker, xk 81, and mesodermal marker, xbra. We treated pluripotent cells with dominant-negative receptors or the chemical inhibitors, dorsomorphin and SB 431542, which each target either the BMP or Activin signaling pathway. We determined the effect of these treatments on retina formation using the Animal Cap Transplant (ACT) assay; in which treated pluripotent cells were transplanted into the eye field of host embryos. We found that inhibition of Activin signaling, in the presence of BMP signaling inhibition, promotes efficient retinal specification in Xenopus tissue, mimicking the affect of adding Noggin alone. In whole embryos, we found that the eye <b>field</b> <b>marker,</b> rax, expanded when adding both dominant-negative Smad 1 and Smad 2, as did treating the cells with both dorsomorphin and SB 431542. Future studies could translate these findings to a mammalian culture assay, in order to more efficiently produce retinal cells in culture...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} here {{an improved}} {{design of the}} Uniform Marker Fields and an algorithm for their fast and reliable detection. Our concept of the <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> is designed {{so that it can}} be detected and recognized for camera pose esti-mation: in various lighting conditions, under a severe per-spective, while heavily occluded, and under a strong motion blur. Our <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> detection harnesses the fact that the edges within the <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> meet at two vanishing points and that the projected planar grid of squares can be defined by a detectable mathematical formalism. The modules of the grid are greyscale and the locations within the <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> are defined by the edges between the modules. The assumption that the <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> is planar allows for a very cheap and reliable camera pose estimation in the captured scene. The detection rates and accuracy are slightly better compared to state-of-the-art marker-based solutions. At the same time, and more importantly, our de-tector of the <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> is several times faster and the re-liable real-time detection can be thus achieved on mobile and low-power devices. We show three targeted applica-tions where the planarity is assured and where the presented <b>marker</b> <b>field</b> design and detection algorithm provide a reli-able and extremely fast solution. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{humanoid}} robot localization and proposes a new method for position estimation that has been developed for the RoboCup Standard Platform League environment. Firstly, a complete vision system has been implemented in the Nao robot platform that enables the detection of relevant <b>field</b> <b>markers.</b> The detection of <b>field</b> <b>markers</b> provides some estimation of distances for the current robot position. To reduce errors in these distance measurements, extrinsic and intrinsic camera calibration procedures have been developed and described. To validate the localization algorithm, experiments covering many of the typical situations that arise during RoboCup games have been developed: ranging from degradation in position estimation to total loss of position (due to falls, ‘kidnapped robot’, or penalization). The self-localization method developed is based on the classical particle filter algorithm. The main contribution of this work is a new particle selection strategy. Our approach reduces the CPU computing time required for each iteration and so eases the limited resource availability problem that is common in robot platforms such as Nao. The experimental results show the quality of the new algorithm in terms of localization and CPU time consumption...|$|R

40|$|Heart {{formation}} {{requires the}} coordinated recruitment of multiple cardiac progenitor cell populations derived {{from both the}} first and second heart fields. In this study, we have ablated the Bmp receptor 1 a and the Wnt effector β-catenin in the developing heart of mice by using MesP 1 -cre, which acts in early mesoderm progenitors that contribute to both first and second heart fields. Remarkably, the entire cardiac crescent and later the primitive ventricle were absent in MesP 1 -cre; BmpR 1 alox/lox mutants. Although myocardial progenitor markers such as Nkx 2 - 5 and Isl 1 and the differentiation marker MLC 2 a were detected in the small, remaining cardiac field in these mutants, the first heart <b>field</b> <b>markers,</b> eHand and Tbx- 5, were not expressed. We conclude from these results that Bmp receptor signaling is crucial for the specification of the first heart field. In MesP 1 -cre; β-cateninlox/lox mutants, cardiac crescent formation, as well as first heart <b>field</b> <b>markers,</b> were not affected, although cardiac looping and right ventricle formation were blocked. Expression of Isl 1 and Bmp 4 in second heart field progenitors was strongly reduced. In contrast, in a gain-of-function mutation of β-catenin using MesP 1 -cre, we revealed an expansion of Isl 1 and Bmp 4 expressing cells, although the heart tube was not formed. We conclude from these results that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates second heart-field development, and that a precise amount and/or timing of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is required for proper heart tube formation and cardiac looping...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{radiation}} field on most megavoltage radiation therapy units are shown by a light field projected through the collimator by a light source mounted inside the collimator. The light field is traditionally used for patient alignment. Hence {{it is imperative}} that the light field is congruent with the {{radiation field}}. Method A simple quality assurance tool has been designed for rapid and simple test of the light field and radiation field using electronic portal images device (EPID) or computed radiography (CR). We tested this QA tool using Varian PortalVision and Elekta iViewGT EPID systems and Kodak CR system. Results Both the single and double exposure techniques were evaluated, with double exposure technique providing a better visualization of the light-radiation <b>field</b> <b>markers.</b> The light and radiation congruency could be detected within 1 mm. This will satisfy the American Association of Physicists in Medicine task group report number 142 recommendation of 2 mm tolerance.

40|$|AbstractPericellular {{proteolysis}} by ADAM family metalloproteinases {{has been}} widely implicated in cell signaling and development. We recently found that Xenopus ADAM 13, an ADAM metalloproteinase, is required for activation of canonical Wnt signaling during cranial neural crest (CNC) induction by regulating a novel crosstalk between Wnt and ephrin B (EfnB) signaling pathways (Wei et al., 2010 b). In the present study we show that the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM 13 also plays important roles in eye development in Xenopus tropicalis. Knockdown of ADAM 13 results in reduced expression of eye <b>field</b> <b>markers</b> pax 6 and rx 1, {{as well as that}} of the pan-neural marker sox 2. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling or inhibition of forward EfnB signaling rescues the eye defects caused by loss of ADAM 13, suggesting that ADAM 13 functions through regulation of the EfnB–Wnt pathway interaction. Downstream of Wnt, the head inducer Cerberus was identified as an effector that mediates ADAM 13 function in early eye field formation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Wnt target gene snail 2 restores cerberus expression and rescues the eye defects caused by ADAM 13 knockdown. Together these data suggest an important role of ADAM 13 -regulated Wnt activity in eye development in Xenopus...|$|R

40|$|Marsupial mammals {{are born}} in an {{embryonic}} state, {{as compared with}} their eutherian counterparts, yet certain features are accelerated. The most conspicuous of these features are the precocial forelimbs, which the newborns use to climb unaided from {{the opening of the}} birth canal to the teat. The developmental mechanisms that produce this acceleration are unknown. Here we show that heterochronic and heterotopic changes early in limb development contribute to forelimb acceleration. Using Tbx 5 and Tbx 4 as fore- and hindlimb <b>field</b> <b>markers,</b> respectively, we have found that, compared with mouse, both limb fields arise notably early during opossum development. Patterning of the forelimb buds is also accelerated, as Shh expression appears early relative to the outgrowth of the bud itself. In addition, the forelimb fields and forelimb myocyte allocation are increased in size and number, respectively, and migration of the spinal nerves into the forelimb bud has been modified. This shift in the extent of the forelimb field is accompanied by shifts in Hox gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis. Furthermore, we found that both fore- and hindlimb fields arise gradually during gastrulation and extension of the embryonic axis, in contrast to the appearance of the limb fields in their entirety in all other known cases. Our results show a surprising evolutionary flexibility in the early limb development program of amniotes and rule out the induction of the limb fields by mature structures such as the somites or mesonephros...|$|R
