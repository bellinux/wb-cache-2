25|$|The {{goal of this}} 18-day {{exercise}} was to provide realistic training environments that closely replicate operational challenges that carrier strike groups might face during military operations around the world. Phase I of COMPTUEX included a <b>detailed</b> <b>schedule</b> of events (SOE) designed to provide specific task training and evaluation for the carrier strike group and warfare commanders. Phase II consisted of a real-world type exercise with no pre-planned SOE, {{and it was also}} known as the final battle problem.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 89 - 92. The {{scheduling}} {{of production}} in job shops is generally accomplished in four stages; aggregate planning, machine loading, sequencing and <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling.</b> In industrial job shops, {{the number of}} jobs and machines makes <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> a particularly complicated and unwieldy task. When faced with this situation, a typical response of managements is to simply ignore the problem and apply some remedial action by adapting existing company operation procedures. The first objective of this dissertation is to indicate the dangers and inefficiencies which result when the problem of <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> is ignored. This is done in terms of a case study analysis in which the problems which currently exist in the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium, a jobbing foundry, are illustrated. The second objective is to develop a systematic approach for the solution of <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> in job shops. Major steps in this approach are: i) a classification of shop scheduling problems ii) a survey of relevant scheduling literature in order to determine existing <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> techniques iii) the design of the scheduling system This approach is illustrated by applying it to the machine shop at Atlantis Aluminium...|$|R
30|$|In the {{subsequent}} research, many researchers {{began to study}} the algorithm for a <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> plan {{on the basis of}} an approximate scheduling plan. Cafaro et al. (2011) chose the simplest monophyletic transfer pipe as the research object, and obtained an approximate scheduling plan and then developed a step-by-step algorithm for detailed planning. Whereafter, a <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> plan that can achieve simultaneously offloading operations was developed (Cafaro et al. 2012). Recently, {{on the basis of the}} previous research, Cafaro et al. (2015) established a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model and made a <b>detailed</b> <b>scheduling</b> plan for a real monophyletic pipeline, considering the hydraulic coupling non-linear constraint.|$|R
