40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{in this paper}} the analysis of transmit beamforming methods in multiple antenna systems over correlated fading channels and with finite rate feedback of the channel state information. The problem is formulated as a general vector quantization problem with encoder side information, constrained quantization space and non-mean-square distortion function. By utilizing the high-resolution distortion analysis of the generalized quantizer, which is applicable {{to a wide range}} of scenarios, we obtain a tight lower bound on the capacity loss of the finite rate quantized MISO system over correlated fading channels. The lower bound of the capacity loss of correlated MISO channels is a generalization of existing results available for i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channels.</b> The bound, in addition to providing insight into the exact nature of dependence of the quantization loss on the channel correlation matrix, indicates that the loss is less than that of the i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channels</b> but with the same exponential decaying factor w. r. t. the feedback rate. The generality of the framework is further demonstrated by considering its application to the analysis of suboptimal mismatched channel quantizers, i. e. quantizers designed with an incorrect channel covariance matrix, and comparing it to systems with optimal quantizers. Finally, numerical and simulation results of the finite rate quantized MISO beamforming system with codebook designed by the Lloyd algorithm are presented that confirm the accuracy of the obtained analytical results.

The MU-MIMO-OFDM system consists of a central node with a twelve-element antenna array and up to six remote nodes each with a single antenna. This paper reports on the analysis of user spatial correlation and the measured MU-MIMO-OFDM system capacity for different scenarios in a campus environment. It was found that channels of users concentrated in a local area with limited scattering can be highly correlated, and thus careful user selection is needed when supporting multiple users in such a scenario by the system.

40|$|RVQ) {{are popular}} in limited {{feedback}} beamforming applications over MIMO channels {{because of their}} low-complexity properties. The goal of this work is on understanding the performance of an ensemble of RVQ codebooks {{as a function of}} the number of bits of feedback (B), antenna dimensions, and spatial correlation. Prior work on RVQ performance has focussed primarily on the large B regime: in either the MISO case (both i. i. d. as well as correlated channels) and the MIMO case (i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channels).</b> In this work, we develop a unified framework tailored to the case of correlated MIMO channels and arbitrary choice of B. Towards this goal, we first study the structure of distribution function of weighted norms of isotropically distributed beamforming vectors. Leveraging this structure, we compute the received SNR loss and mutual information loss of a B-bit RVQ scheme relative to a perfect channel information benchmark. Our computation reveals the following: i) The loss terms are a product of two factors. The first factor, that is also common to analysis of i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channels,</b> decays as B increases at the rate 2 −B/(Nt− 1) where Nt is the number of transmit antennas, ii) The second factor reflects the condition number of the channel. Thus, the condition number of the channel reflects RVQ performance in the practically relevant small B regime. More specifically, a channel that minimizes/maximizes the condition number on average also minimizes/maximizes the performance loss, respectively. Such behavior is typical of channels that correspond to rich spatial scattering (i. i. d. -like), and poor spatial scattering (rank- 1 channels), respectively. I...|$|R
