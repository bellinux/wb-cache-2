It was revealed that white oil, a petroleum product was mixed with edible mustard oil. Sale of mustard in loose quantity was banned by a court order, to prevent more health hazards. In September 1998, the ban on packed mustard oil was removed after a Cabinet decision with a condition that the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> should be prominently displayed.

Morgan was a regular in the half back line of Morgan, Jim Pearce and Ernie Brinton making 35 appearances without scoring in 1935-36. The same regular half back line played in the next season 1936-37 with Morgan making 32 appearances scoring 1 goal. Morgan an expert dead ball kicker made 41 appearances scoring 2 goals as Bristol City finished runners up in Third Division South in 1937-38 being pipped for promotion by one point by Millwall. Morgan earned a first benefit match, jointly with Cyril Bridge, on 16 April 1938 when City beat Torquay United 2-0 in the League. Morgan made 19 appearances in 1938-39 sharing the right half duties with Bob Caldwell. Morgan made a further 3 appearances in the truncated 1939-40 season. In war time competitions Cliff Morgan made 203 appearances scoring 15 goals for Bristol City. When league football restarted after the Second World War Morgan resumed his career with 32 appearances scoring 2 goals as Bristol City finished in 3rd place in the Third Division South. Cliff Morgan was awarded a second benefit match on 12 October 1946 v Bournemouth when Morgan himself scored the only goal of the game. In 1947-48 Morgan made 19 appearances and was appointed player-coach in April 1948. He made 15 appearances scoring 2 goals in his final season 1948-49.|$|R

40|$|By using a protein-design {{algorithm}} that quantitatively considers side-chain <b>packing,</b> {{the effect}} <b>of</b> specific steric constraints on protein design was assessed {{in the core}} of the streptococcal protein G beta 1 domain.

The structural flexibility and stability of several of the designed proteins were experimentally determined and showed a trend from well-ordered to highly mobile structures as the degree <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity in the design decreased. This trend both demonstrates that the inclusion <b>of</b> specific <b>packing</b> interactions is necessary for the design of native-like proteins and defines a useful range <b>of</b> <b>packing</b> specificity for the design algorithm.
