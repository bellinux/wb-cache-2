5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I figured <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
25|$|The message <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> to Aikidoka {{in general}} {{is that what we}} see today is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder. It has become so many other things. So many complications, {{additions}} and unnecessary requirements hide the essential nature of the art. However, those who seek shall find, and if they are able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E
500|$|Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine {{noted that}} like the season premiere, the episode [...] "mostly serves to add uncomfortable {{wrinkles}} {{to one of}} the show's saints, {{going so far as to}} make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable." [...] He added [...] "While I... question the need for the flashbacks, I must confess to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "Last week's Jin/Sun episode was something of a disappointment, not because it was a bad episode of Lost, per se (<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> it a solid B), but because it wasn't as good as the exhilarating season premiere (which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> an A+)." ...|$|E

500|$|Hamilton's {{policies}} as Secretary of the Treasury greatly affected the United States government and still continue to influence it. His constitutional interpretation, specifically of the Necessary and Proper Clause, set precedents for federal authority {{that are still}} used by the courts and are considered an authority on constitutional interpretation. The prominent French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, who spent 1794 in the United States, wrote, [...] "I consider Napoleon, Fox, and Hamilton the three greatest men of our epoch, and if I were forced to decide between the three, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> without hesitation {{the first place to}} Hamilton", adding that Hamilton had intuited the problems of European conservatives.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} {{may also}} have been spurred by the Khazars' decision to close passage down the Volga in response to the raid of 943. In the Khazar Correspondence, written around 950–960, the Khazar ruler Joseph reported his role as defender of the Muslim polities of the Caspian region against Rus' incursions: [...] "I have to wage war with them , for if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as Baghdad." [...] Earlier conflict between Muslim elements of the Khazar army and Rus' marauders in c. 912 may have contributed to this arrangement and the hostility of the Rus' against Khazaria.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again I never saw him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E

The two songs were released in Germany as a double A-Side, {{and both of them}} were turned into music, which – besides members of the film's cast – featured Suggs, Chas Smash, Woody and stand-in guitarist Burdette. A re-recorded version of [...] "NW5" [...] was released as a single on 14 January 2008 in the UK reaching no. 24 – this recording featured original Madness guitarist Chris Foreman, who had rejoined the band in time for the 2006 Christmas tour, but had not participated in the original recording of the song.|$|E
500|$|In 1848 Richard Cobden had written: [...] "Almost every {{crime and}} outrage in Ireland is {{connected}} with the occupation or ownership of land... if I had the power, I would always make the proprietors of the soil resident, by breaking up the large properties. In other words, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> Ireland to the Irish". Nevertheless, his views were held {{in the context of}} Unionism; he had condemned the 1848 [...] "Young Ireland" [...] rebellion as an act of insanity. Jane adopted her father's standpoint on Irish land reform, yet embraced the cause of Irish home rule—on which she lectured regularly—and was a strong supporter of the Land League. After visiting Ireland with the Women's Mission to Ireland in 1887, she subsequently used the pages of the English press to expose the mistreatment of evicted tenants. In a letter to The Times, Jane and her associates cited one particular case—that of the Ryan family of Cloughbready in County Tipperary—to illustrate the British government's harshness towards even the most vulnerable of individuals. Jane sent money and food to alleviate the Ryan family's distress.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is based}} on a legend, but it is given {{credence}} by at least two texts that assert Anarkali's existence during the historical period of the greatest monarch of the Mughal Empire, Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). One of the books states that in 1615 a marble tomb was built on Anarkali's grave in Lahore by Salim, when he had become Emperor Jehangir. On the tomb is a Persian inscription that reads: [...] "Ta Kiyamat shukr geom kardgate khwesh ra, Aah garman bez benaam roo-e yare khwesh ra", meaning in English: [...] "Ah! could I behold the face of my love once more, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> thanks to my God until the day of resurrection." [...] The author of the stage play on which the film is based, Imtiaz Ali Taj, believed that the legend had no historical base, but historians have suggested that Anarkali may have been a painter, a dancer, or a courtesan, or one of Akbar's wives and the mother of Salim's half-brother Prince Daniyal. While an earlier film version of the story, Anarkali (1952), contained a disclaimer stating that the story had no foundation in history, Mughal-e-Azam made no such claim.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin and the Mysterious Mr. X {{attempts}} {{to solve a}} mystery: [...] "Samuel Butler, a master of acrimonious polemic, confronted Charles Darwin with the sorest of all scientific subjects—a dispute about priority. In Evolution Old and New (1879), Butler accused Darwin of slighting the evolutionary speculations of Buffon, Lamarck, and his own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin." [...] The Kirkus Reviews calls it, [...] "...an essay devoted to resurrecting the name and importance of Edward Blyth, a 19th-century naturalist. Eiseley credits Blyth {{with the development of}} the idea, and even the coining of the words [...] "natural selection," [...] which Darwin absorbed and enlarged upon... some thoughts on Darwin's Descent of Man; and a concluding speculation on the meaning of evolution. The last piece is very much Eiseley's poetic from-whence-do-we come/whither-do-we-go vein. [...] Many experts on Darwin such as Stephen Jay Gould disagreed with Eisley. [...] Michael Ruse, a philosopher of science, even stated [...] "If a work like this was handed into me for a course. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> it a failing grade." ...|$|E

Often <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> a {{finished}} version and an unfinished for this purpose. If I remember correctly, it was usually the words that I left undone." [...] Regarding the evolution of Peyton's artwork over the years, she said, [...] "I {{look back at the}} first season and think the drawings are awful! I certainly became more comfortable working in her style, but I think her style also evolved to fit mine. Does that make sense?" [...] Ward clarified, [...] "Initially I was trying to do something that just didn’t flow well from me. The drawings were too clean. A little forced and not at all the way I liked to work." [...] Ward said that as the show progressed, she began to put more of my own style in them, and became more comfortable and the work got better. In Season 3, the artwork was promoted through the album Friends with Benefit. In Season 6, it is seen in color instead of in black and white, to reflect the character's happiness.|$|E
2500|$|On December 2, 2016, David Feldman Promotions {{confirmed}} a {{fight between}} Jones and undefeated bare-knuckle fighter and former world title challenger Bobby Gunn would be announced for February 17, 2017 for the vacant WBF Cruiserweight championship {{at a press conference}} on December 6 at the Chase Center in Delaware. At the time of announcement, Gunn was a former IBA cruiserweight champion and bare-knuckle heavyweight champion, with a record of 72-0 with 72 knockouts. The fight was made official at the press conference on December 7. Jones spoke of his long-awaited desire to fight Gunn, [...] "I always do things that people don't expect me to do. I promised Bobby {{a long time ago that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> him the opportunity, and I am a man of my word. Come February 17th, I am going to shock the world again." [...] At the official weigh-in Jones came in 199 pounds and Gunn weighed in lighter at 197.4 pounds. In a slow-paced fight, Jones stopped Gunn in the beginning of the 8th round, before Gunn had even left his corner, to win the vacant World Boxing Foundation cruiserweight title. Gunn injured his nose and was out boxed by Jones throughout seven rounds. In the post fight, Jones and Gunn both embraced.|$|E
2500|$|From {{an article}} in The New York Times: [...] "He [...] has been to more Army camps and played to more {{soldiers}} than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp {{in this country has}} heard him sing and tell funny stories." [...] Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for Variety, in 1942: [...] "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> a show." [...] After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, [...] "Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person.
