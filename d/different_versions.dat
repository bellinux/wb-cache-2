There are several <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (<b>different</b> <b>versions</b> of the same structure).|$|E

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> {{of the album}} cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented {{with a variety of}} treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
