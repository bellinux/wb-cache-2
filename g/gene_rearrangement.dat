25|$|The cortex {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} thymocytes, {{supported}} by a network of finely-branched epithelial reticular cells, which is continuous with a similar network in the medulla. This network forms an adventitia to the blood vessels, which enter the cortex via septa near the junction with the medulla.

25|$|The {{system is}} highly {{adaptable}} because of somatic hypermutation (a process of accelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows {{a small number}} of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Since the <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangement</b> leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all progeny (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the memory B cells and memory T cells that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity.|$|E

Besides the obvious possibility of retrotransposition, <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> may be induced by sequences that stimulate genetic recombination.

25|$|The key {{disadvantage}} in a <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangement</b> process for T cell receptors {{is that by}} random chance, some arrangements of gene fragments will create a T cell receptor capable of binding self-peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II. If T cells bearing these T cell receptors were to enter the periphery, they {{would be capable of}} activating an immune response against self, resulting in autoimmunity. Negative selection is the process evolved to reduce this risk. During negative selection, all thymocytes with a high affinity for binding self peptides presented on MHC class I or class II are induced to upregulate BCL2L11, a protein which drives apoptosis. Cells which do not have a high affinity for self-antigens survive negative selection. At this stage, some cells are also selected to become regulatory T cells, usually cells which have an intermediate affinity for self-peptide.|$|E

40|$|Mexico {{has one of}} {{the highest}} incidences of {{childhood}} leukemia worldwide and significantly higher mortality rates for this disease compared with other countries. One possible cause is the high prevalence of <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> associated with the etiology or with a poor prognosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aims of this multicenter study were to determine the prevalence of the four most common <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> [ETV 6 -RUNX 1, TCF 3 -PBX 1, BCR-ABL 1, and MLL rearrangements] and to explore their relationship with mortality rates during the first year of treatment in ALL children from Mexico City. Patients were recruited from eight public hospitals during 2010 – 2012. A total of 282 bone marrow samples were obtained at each child’s diagnosis for screening by conventional and multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to determine the <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> <b>Gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> were detected in 50 (17. 7 %) patients. ETV 6 -RUNX 1 was detected in 21 (7. 4 %) patients, TCF 3 -PBX 1 in 20 (7. 1 %) patients, BCR-ABL 1 in 5 (1. 8 %) patients, and MLL rearrangements in 4 (1. 4 %) patients.

2500|$|The medulla is the {{location}} of the latter events in thymocyte development. [...] Thymocytes that reach the medulla have already successfully undergone T-cell receptor <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangement</b> and positive selection, and have been exposed to a limited degree of negative selection. [...] The medulla is specialized to allow thymocytes to undergo additional rounds of negative selection to remove auto-reactive T cells from the mature repertoire. Transcriptional regulators AIRE and FEZ2 are expressed by the thymic medullary epithelium, and drives the transcription of organ-specific genes such as insulin to allow maturing thymocytes to be exposed to a more complex set of self-antigens than is present in the cortex.|$|E
2500|$|The {{evolution}} of the AIS, based on Ig, TCR, and MHC molecules, {{is thought to have}} arisen from two major evolutionary events: the transfer of the RAG transposon (possibly of viral origin) and two whole genome duplications. [...] Though the molecules of the AIS are well-conserved, they are also rapidly evolving. [...] Yet, a comparative approach finds that many features are quite uniform across taxa. [...] All the major features of the AIS arose early and quickly. [...] Jawless fishes have a different AIS that relies on <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangement</b> to generate diversity but has little else in common with the jawed vertebrate AIS. The innate immune system, which has an important role in AIS activation, is the most important defense system of invertebrates and plants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{which has}} been best-studied in mammals, originated in jawed fish approximately 500 million years ago. [...] Most of the molecules, cells, tissues, and associated mechanisms of this system of defense are found in cartilaginous fishes. Lymphocyte receptors, Ig and TCR, are found in all jawed vertebrates. [...] The most ancient Ig class, IgM, is membrane-bound and then secreted upon stimulation of cartilaginous fish B cells. [...] Another isotype, shark IgW, is related to mammalian IgD. [...] TCRs, both α/β and γ/δ, are found in all animals from gnathostomes to mammals. [...] The organization of gene segments that undergo <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangement</b> differs in cartilaginous fishes, which have a cluster form {{as compared to the}} translocon form in bony fish to mammals.

40|$|SummaryB cells {{produce a}} diverse {{antibody}} repertoire by undergoing <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> Pathogen exposure induces the clonal expansion of B cells expressing antibodies that can bind the infectious agent. To assess human B cell responses to trivalent seasonal influenza and monovalent pandemic H 1 N 1 vaccination, we sequenced <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, {{a major determinant of}} epitope recognition. The magnitude of B cell clonal expansions correlates with an individual’s secreted antibody {{response to the}} vaccine, and the expanded clones are enriched with those expressing influenza-specific monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, B cell responses to pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 vaccination and infection in different people show a prominent family of convergent antibody heavy chain <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> specific to influenza antigens.

40|$|The IGH gene {{configuration}} {{was investigated}} in 97 childhood precursor-B-ALL patients at initial diagnosis. Rearrangements were found by Southern blotting in all but three patients (97 %) and in 30 cases (31 %) we observed oligoclonal IGH <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> Heteroduplex PCR analysis revealed at least one clonal PCR product in all Southern blot-positive cases. In 89 patients (92 %) complete V(D) J rearrangements were found, while incomplete D-H-J(H) rearrangements occurred in only 21 patients (22 %). In 5 % of cases the DH-JH rearrangements were the sole IGH <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> Sequence analysis of the 31 identified incomplete rearrangements revealed preferential usage of segments from the D(H) 2, D(H) 3 and D(H) 7 families (78 %). While D(H) 2 and D(H) 3 <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> occur frequently in normal B cells and B cell precursors, the relatively frequent usage of D(H) 7 - 27 (19 %) in precursor-B-ALL patients is suggestive of leukemic transformation during prenatal lymphopoiesis. Among J(H) gene segments in the incomplete DH-JH rearrangements, the J(H) 6 segment was significantly overrepresented (61 %). This observation together with the predominant usage of the most upstream D-H genes indicates {{that many of the}} identified clonal D-H-J(H) <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in precursor-B-ALL probably represent secondary recombinations, having deleted pre-existing D-H-J(H) joinings. The patients with incomplete D-H-J(H) <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> were frequently characterized by hyperdiploid karyotype with additional copies of chromosome 14 and/or by IGH oligoclonality. The presence of incomplete D-H-J(H) joinings was also significantly associated with a less mature immunogenotype: overrepresentation Of V(H) 6 - 1 gene segment usage, absence of biallelic TCRD deletions, and low frequency of TCRG <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> This immature immunogenotype of precursor-B-ALL with incomplete IGH <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> was not associated with more aggressive disease...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} the Southern blot hybridization technique to diagnose B-cell lymphoma by detecting clonal immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in lymph node and other biopsy tissues. DNA was isolated {{from a wide variety of}} neoplastic and non-neoplastic specimens and analyzed for the presence of rearranged immunoglobulin genes using radiolabeled DNA probes specific for the heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin constant region genes. Among the specimens examined, clonal immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> were found only in biopsy samples of B-cell lymphoma and not in samples containing reactive lymphoid processes or non-B-cell cancers. In lymphomas, the presence of rearrangements for either the kappa or lambda light-chain gene correlated with expression of one or the other of these chains when cellular immunoglobulins could be detected by frozen-section immunophenotyping techniques. The analysis of immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods for lymphomas, including improved sensitivity in detecting minor populations of neoplastic lymphocytes composing as little as 1 % of the total cell population. In addition, clonal immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> are demonstrable in a subset of lymphomas that lack detectable surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, thus offering positive evidence for both malignancy and the B-cell origin of these tumors. Our studies indicate that detection of immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> is a valuable method for diagnosis and classification of various lymphoproliferative disorders that are difficult to evaluate histologically or that lack distinctive antigenic markers...|$|R

40|$|We used a gene {{amplification}} strategy to analyze T-cell receptor (TCR) <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in 185 specimens, including mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS), other cutaneous neoplasms, inflammatory dermatoses, reactive lymphoid tissues,and normal skin. Genomic DNA was extracted from lesional tissues and rearrangements of the TCR-γ chain gene were amplified using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) with primers specific for rearrangements involving Vγ 1 - 8 or Vγ 9 gene segments. The resulting PCR products were then separated according to their nucleotide sequence as well as size by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE). Dominant clonal TCR-γ <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> were detected in 61 of 68 MF/SS cases by PCR/DGGE. This sensitivity of 90 % compared to a sensitivity of only 59 % when dominant clonality was sought in 17 of these same cases by Southern blot analysis of TCR-& <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> This difference in sensitivity was greatest in early, minimally infiltrated skin lesions. PCR/DGGE was also more sensitive than Southern blot analysis for detecting peripheral blood involvement in two cases of early MF. Among 12 additional specimens of suspected MF/SS, nine (75 %) showed clonal TCR-γ <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> by PCR/DGGE including six of eight cases with a previously confirmed diagnosis of MF/SS and three of four cases without prior known MF/SS. Among 105 non-MF/SS specimens, dominant TCR-γ <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> were detected in only six cases (6 %). Four were diagnosed as chronic dermatitis and two were diagnosed as cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia. We conclude that the large majority of MF/SS cases, including patch phase disease, possess dominant clonal TCR-γ <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> PCR/DGGE is more sensitive than Southern blot analysis for detecting dominant clonality and staging disease in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MF/SS. However, because PCR/DGGE is sensitive enough to detect dominant TCR-y <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in a subset of patients with chronic dermatitis, it cannot be used as the sole criterion for establishing a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. As with other molecular biologic clonality in some cases of histologically nonspecific dermatitis allows the identification of a previously unrecorgnized subset of patients, i. e., those with “clonal dermatitis”. It will be important to determine the long-term risk of MF/SS among these patients because our study indicated that MF/SS can sometimes present with lesions indistinguishable from clonal dermatitis...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of rearrangements of the gamma- and beta-chain T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in T- and non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs), and potentially to determine which genes rearrange first in ontogeny, we analyzed high molecular weight DNA from 102 patients with acute leukemia. Rearranged gamma- and beta-chain genes were found in all T-cell ALLs (22 / 22) examined. Overall, 27 % (18 / 66) of B-lineage ALLs had beta-chain <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements,</b> and 41 % (24 / 58) had gamma-chain <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements,</b> but {{the distribution of}} rearranged genes varied according to the stage of B-cell differentiation. The gamma-chain genes were rearranged in 11 % (1 / 9) of the B-lineage patients negative for the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (cALLA) and 50 % (23 / 46) of cALLA+ ALL patients, while the beta-chain genes were not rearranged {{in any of the}} 7 cALLA- ALL patients examined but were rearranged in 32 % (18 / 56) of the cALLA+ patients. Neither TCR gene was found to be rearranged in acute nonlymphoid leukemia patients (0 / 12) or in patients with B-cell (surface immunoglobulin-positive) leukemia (0 / 3). Of the 44 cALLA+ patients in which a direct comparison of gamma- and beta-chain <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> could be made, 34 % had both genes rearranged, 16 % had only gamma-chain <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements,</b> and the remaining 50 % had both genes in the germ-line configuration. beta-Chain rearrangements have not been found in the absence of gamma-chain rearrangements, thus supporting a proposed hierarchy of TCR <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> A provocative finding was that only a small percentage (11 %) of the patients with cALLA- B precursor cell ALLs had rearranged TCR genes, while 50 % of the cALLA+ leukemia patients had at least gamma-chain rearrangement, raising a question as to whether indeed cALLA- cells are precursors to cALLA+ cells.

40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) {{represents}} {{the most frequent}} malignancy in childhood. Last decades brought enormous progress in ALL treatment and {{in the understanding of}} ALL biology (see Chapter 1. 1), but still 20 to 30 % of children suffer from relapse and many of them will ultimately die of disease progression. The currently used cytomorphological (microscopic) techniques can only detect 1 to 5 % of malignant cells, which is not sufficiently sensitive for identification of patients who are prone to relapse and who might be rescued by treatment intensification. During the past 15 years several approaches have been developed for detection of much lower numbers of malignant cells, i. e. for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in various hematopoietic malignancies (see Chapter 1. 2). Monitoring of MRD with sensitivities of 1 Q- 4 to 1 o- 6 (i. e. one malignant cell within the background of 104 to 106 normal cells) has significantly higher prognostic value than conventional cytomorphological techniques and other clinical parameters at diagnosis and is therefore currently implemented into clinical practice in several hematopoietic malignancies, including ALL. In childhood ALL, detection of MRD most frequently relies on patient-specific immunoglobulin (lg) and T-cell receptor (TCR) <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> as molecular markers for PCR studies. The junctional regions of rearranged lg and TCR genes are unique "fingerprint-like" sequences, which are assumed to be different in each lymphoid cell and thus also in each lymphoid malignancy. They can be easily identified and characterized for instance by using heteroduplex PCR analysis (see Chapter 2. 2) and direct sequencing. This thesis aimed at detailed evaluation of lg and TCR <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in ALL with regard to the following aspects: -characterization of lg/TCR <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> patterns in precursor-BALL and T-ALL; - immunobiological differences between malignant and normal lymphoid cells; -stability of clonal lg/TCR <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> at relapse of ALL; -applicability of lg/TCR <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> as PCR targets for detection of MRD. Virtually all precursor-B-ALL (96 %) have rearranged lg heavy chain (/GH) genes. In most cases (80 - 90 %) this concerns complete VH-DH-JH rearrangements on at least one allele. Incomplete DH-JH rearrangements could be identified in 22 % of patients, being the sole /GH <b>gene</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in only 5 % of patients (see Chapter 2. 3).
