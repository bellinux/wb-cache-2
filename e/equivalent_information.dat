40|$|Abstract—Real-time and {{reliable}} location information of mo-bile nodes {{is a key}} enabler for many emerging wireless network applications. Such information can be obtained via network navigation, a new paradigm in which nodes exploit both spatial and temporal cooperation to infer their positions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation for network navigation and determine the fundamental limits of navigation accuracy using <b>equivalent</b> Fisher <b>information</b> analysis. We then introduce the notion of carry-over information and provide a geometrical interpretation {{for the evolution of}} navigation information. Our framework unifies the navigation information obtained from spa-tial and temporal cooperation, leading to a deep understanding of information evolution and cooperation benefits in navigation networks.

30|$|Regarding the {{localization}} {{performance in}} terms of the MT location, {{it is interesting to note}} from Fig. 10 that the RMSE is locally large for locations on the line connecting the two usable APs. This can be explained by noting that the locations on such a line correspond to the case where the <b>equivalent</b> Fisher <b>information</b> matrix expressed in (30) is singular. Intuitively, the singularity indicates that the available information is not sufficient for estimation, i.e., the location information contribution in the observation data is not sufficient for deducing a location. Therefore, the localization performance in the singularity case here is extremely vulnerable to the AWGN. It may be noted from Figs. 11 and 12 that having more usable APs effectively relieves the singularity problem, especially for locations farther away from the two underlying APs. In contrast, having more usable APs is less effective in relieving the problem for locations close to an AP, possibly because the <b>equivalent</b> Fisher <b>information</b> matrix for such a location is largely dominated by only the contribution of that AP.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Accurate {{positional}} {{information is}} essential for many applications in wireless networks. Time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) {{are the two most}} commonly used signal metrics for localizing nodes with unknown positions. In this paper, we consider a wireless network in which each node is equipped with a wideband antenna array capable of performing both TOA and AOA measurements. Since both the position and orientation of the agent are of interest, we propose a localization framework that jointly estimates these two parameters. The notion of <b>equivalent</b> Fisher <b>information</b> is applied to derive the squared error bounds for the position and orientation. Since our analysis starts from the received waveforms rather than directly from the signal metrics, these bounds characterize the fundamental limits of the position and orientation accuracy. Surprisingly, our result reveals that AOA measurements obtained by wideband antenna arrays do not further improve position accuracy beyond that provided by TOA measurements.

50|$|Computer-aided {{design is}} the use of {{computer}} software to create drawings. Today the vast majority of technical drawings of all kinds are made using CAD. Instead of drawing lines on paper, the computer records <b>equivalent</b> <b>information</b> electronically. There are many advantages to this system: repetition is reduced because complex elements can be copied, duplicated and stored for re-use. Errors can be deleted, and the speed of draughting allows many permutations to be tried before the design is finalised. On the other hand, CAD drawing encourages a proliferation of detail and increased expectations of accuracy, aspects which reduce the efficiency originally expected from the move to computerisation.|$|E
