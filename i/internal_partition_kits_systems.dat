Under the specified testing protocol, a significant nonlinear pinched behavior of the tested specimen is observed. The pinch ed beha vior is caused by the damage in the screwed connections, whose cyclic behavior is strongly degrading. Both stiffness and strength of the specimens are significantly influenced by the board typology and the amount of screwed connection s. Finally, it is concluded that Eurocode s significantly underestimate the resisting bending moment of the tested specimens...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGiven that {{airtightness}} {{is recognized}} as an essential issue for low-energy dwellings, today it is often included in energy performance (EP) calculations, frequently through single-zone models with uniform air leakage. Because more consideration is often given to EP than to indoor air quality issues, air leakage through <b>internal</b> <b>partitions</b> is often disregarded. Therefore, additional {{studies are needed to}} check these assumptions. In the present study air leakage through the building envelope and through <b>internal</b> <b>partitions</b> is investigated. This paper presents the methodology used in an experimental study, conducted to measure multizone air leakages, using the guarded zone pressurization technique. We developed a detailed innovative database with 456 exterior and <b>internal</b> <b>partition</b> wall air leakage measurements, taken in 23 detached houses. For each wall, the database includes general information on the building, special requirements, the building's main characteristics, measurement protocol, type of wall, measurement input data and measurement results (CL, n, q 50 and the reliability index developed). Then an analysis of this database is provided. The analysis reveals most important relationships. For instance, <b>internal</b> <b>partition</b> wall air leakage is not related to the envelope's airtightness level; instead, the type of building structure has greater influence. Through this study, we underline the impact on building airflows of more detailed modelling of internal and external air leakage in multizone approaches, with consequences on indoor air quality (IAQ) bedrooms where people spend most of their time. As a conclusion, we propose air leakage values and dispersion input data for multizone IAQ models...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Kit</b> <b>system,</b> {{including}} <b>Kit</b> ligand and its receptor Kit, has critical {{roles in}} mammalian reproduction, {{especially in the}} ovary. Unlike mammalian species, two copies of genes {{are present in the}} zebrafish genome for both ligand (kitlga and kitlgb) and receptor (kita and kitb). Phylogenetic and chromo-some synteny analyses suggest that these duplicated genes were likely derived from the third round of genome duplication in vertebrate evolution. All four <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> members were expressed in the zebrafish ovary, suggesting potential roles for the system in ovarian development and function. As the first step toward understanding the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> in the zebrafish ovary, especially the differential roles of different forms of ligand and receptor, the present study was undertaken to analyze the temporal expression profiles of the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> during folliculo-genesis. All members of the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> exhibited significant and distinct variation in expression, particularly in the periovulatory period. During the transition from the primary growth to secondary growth, kitlga showed a dramatic increase, suggesting a role for Kit signaling in follicle recruitment. During final oocyte maturation, kitlga expression significantly decreased after a transitional surge before germinal vesicle breakdown, whereas all other members exhibited an increased expression, with kitlgb and kita reaching the peak expression levels in the ovulated eggs. Our results provide strong evidence that the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> is involved in regulating zebrafish ovarian function and that different isoforms of Kit and Kit ligand may have differential roles in folliculogenesis. This provides an example for neo-functionalization of duplicated genes in vertebrates. follicle, Kit, Kit ligand, ovary, stem cell factor, zebrafis...|$|R
