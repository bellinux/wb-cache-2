40|$|The {{conventional}} way {{to drive}} modifications in old <b>forest</b> tree <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{is to establish}} progeny trials involving each parent tree and then evaluate its contribution {{to the performance of}} the progeny by estimating its general and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA). In this work, we successfully applied an alternative parent selection tactic based on paternity testing of superior offspring derived from a hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> established with a single Eucalyptus grandis seed parents and six E. urophylla pollen parents. A battery of 14 microsatellite markers was used to carry out parentage tests of 256 progeny individuals including two independent samples of selected trees and one control unselected sample, all derived from 6 -year-old forest stands in eastern Brazil. Paternity determination was carried out for all progeny individuals by a sequential paternity exclusion procedure. Exclusion was declared only when the obligatory paternal allele in the progeny tree was not present in the alleged parent tree for at least four independent markers to avoid false exclusions due to mutation or null alleles. After maternity checks to identify seed mixtures and selfed individuals, the paternity tests revealed that approximately 29 % of the offspring was sired by pollen parents outside the orchard. No selfed progeny were found in the selected samples. Three pollen parents were found to have sired essentially all of the offspring in the samples of selected and non-selected progeny individuals. One of these three parents sired significantly more selected progeny than unselected ones (P_ 0. 0002 in a Fisher exact test). Based on these results, low-reproductive-successful parents were culled from the orchard, and management procedures were adopted to minimize external pollen contamination. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) in mean annual increment was observed between forest stands produced with <b>seed</b> from the <b>orchard</b> before and after selection of parents and revitalization of the orchard. An average realized gain of 24. 3 % in volume growth was obtained from the selection of parents as measured in forest stands at age 2 – 4 years.

40|$|Abstract Weather {{conditions}} {{during the}} growing season are determining the size and quality of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seed crop in northern areas. Pathogens, fungi, and insects also have an effect on seed crops. The varying quality of <b>seeds</b> from <b>forest</b> stands and <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> does not full fill the germination requirements of tree nurseries. Multi-phase pre-treatment are therefore used in <b>forest</b> tree <b>seed</b> centres to improve seed lots quality. The main objectives of this study were to analyse long-term variation in the size and quality of Scots pine seed crops in Northern Finland. Determine the impact of fungal injuries on the structures of Norway spruce seeds. To detect changes in the germination capacity and rate of Norway spruce seeds during pre-treatment phases and to determine the impacts of short-term and long-term storage on the germination of treated seeds. The study found that in most years, regeneration of Scots pine in Northern Finland is limited by quantity as well as quality the seed crop. The long-term average of the Scots pine seed crop was 77 seeds/m 2 and the long-term average expected germination percentage was 61 %. Aeciospores of the inlad spruce cone rust Chrysomyxa pirolata (Körnicke) Wint. were found to form inside Norway spruce seeds, destroying the nucellar layers and reducing germination of seeds. In general, the germination capacity and rate of Norway spruce seeds increased during pre-treatment phases. The germination capacity of seeds increased about 30 % and the rate by more than 40 % during pre-treatment. During long-term storage the germination capacity and rate of pre-treated Scots pine seeds were preserved better in frozen storage than in cool storage. It was found that pre-treated Scots pine <b>forest</b> stand <b>seeds</b> can be stored for several years in frozen conditions. The germination capacity and rate of pre-treated <b>orchard</b> <b>seeds</b> were effected significantly more than those from forest stands. It is therefore recommended that Scots pine <b>seeds</b> from <b>orchards</b> be stored without pre-treatment.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{more than}} 20 years, since we started to study flower {{characteristics}} and the mating system in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> of Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. A number of papers {{have been published in}} Chinese journals. Some results concerning variation of mating system parameters, pollen contamination and pollen dispersal with enzyme and SSR analysis are summarized in this paper. Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. is an important tree species for Northern China due to its extensive distribution, tolerance in harsh sites, rather fast growth and high wood quality. Seed crops in <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> are stable, if insects are controlled. The high genetic quality and ample yield of seeds in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is closely related with the mating pattern of <b>seed</b> <b>orchards.</b> In order to make a clear picture of the temporal and spatial change in the mating system parameters, namely outcrossing, inbreeding, selfing and contamination rates in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> as well as pollen dispersal distance, field observation of flower characteristics with laboratory analysis was continuously carried out more than 20 years (Shen X.

A tree improvement programme has been ongoing at the Institute for Commercial Forestry Research for two decades, but genetic improvement in the species has been slow due to delayed and infrequent flowering and seed production. Three trials were established, firstly, to quantify the gains {{that have been made}} in the first generation of improvement in the breeding programme and, secondly, to establish whether a number of <b>seed</b> source and <b>orchard</b> variables influence the performance of the progeny. These variables were the amount of flowering trees in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> year of <b>seed</b> collection, <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> origin and composition of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> bulks.

Native provenances and clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families were compared in this study. & Materials and methods Forty-one genetic origins of teak, including 26 open-pollinated families from a clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> in Ivory Coast, were planted in 1997 in a replicated trial at Taliwas, Sabah, East Malaysia. & Results and discussion The mortality rate and early measurements of height, and diameter at breast height varied substantially between treatments. The largest height (> 18 m) and diameter (> 21 cm) values recorded after 104 months were mostly from the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families, while the lower performances were mainly observed for the native provenances. Narrow sense heritabilities, assessed for the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families only, increased gradually with age, reaching relatively high values, especially for height at 104 months (h 2 = 0. 76). There were also some highly {{significant differences between the}} 41 genetic origins for six qualitative traits observed from 25 to 104 months. Overall, the clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> families were marginally less crooked and grew more vertically than the other sources. & Conclusions These findings provide further evidence of the usefulness of a clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> phase in the genetic improvement of teak and the beneficial influence of a wet tropical climate on major economic traits.

40|$|Establishment of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> {{is aimed}} at {{producing}} good quality seeds which is an important activity for breeding program. <b>Seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is also a base population, thus its genetic diversity is depending on its design and composition (provenance, family and individual tree). Selection of an individual tree in <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> is needed for the enhancement of retaining good-character trees. However, selection of individual tree can change the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> and the degrees to which the genetic diversity will change depend on the used selection methods. In order to investigate the effects of selection methods, 4 simulations of selection methods based on height, diameter and stem performance of individual trees were used. The differences among the 4 methods were the ranking of individual trees those selected, and families and provenances those have been represented. Seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of Acacia mangium in Wonogiri, Central Java was used as materials. Analysis of genetic diversity was carried out using AFLP markers. Nine primer combinations were used to produce 1025 AFLP banding patterns. Among those banding patterns, only 109 were polymorphic markers. No significant effect of individual tree selection was revealed in this study. Even though the selection was done intensively, only 7. 1 % of genetic diversity was reduced. In other words, the selection activity did not reduce the genetic diversity of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> significantly. The result is important for developing future tree improvement of A. mangium, including development of hybrid between A. mangium and A. auriculiformis...|$|R
40|$|Northern red oak is a high-value {{hardwood}} {{used for}} lumber, furniture and veneer. Intensively managed northern red oak <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> {{are required to}} obtain genetic gain for trait improvement. Data from conifer <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> and natural and managed stands of hardwood trees have {{shed light on the}} distance over which pollen can move, and underscore the need for managerial attention to <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> design, placement, and maintenance. We used eleven microsatellite markers to investigate pollen gene flow, female mate choice, and male reproductive success in a clonal <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> of northern red oak based on paternity analysis of <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> offspring in progeny tests. Nearly all (93 %) offspring were sired by a male parent within the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> The mean number of male parents per year was 69. 5, or 47. 6 % of all clones in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> Female clones in the early phenology group had more offspring sired from extra-orchard pollen (13 %) than clones in the intermediate (5 %) and late (1 %) phenology groups. Distance was the largest influence on pollination success, and pollination occurred most often by male trees in the same subline as the maternal tree. Males in the early phenology group sired more offspring overall in the progeny pool and more offspring per mother tree than males in the intermediate or late phenology groups. Average genetic correlations among all OP progeny ranged between 0. 2557 and 0. 3529 with a mean of 0. 28 ± 0. 01. The importance of progeny test genotyping for northern red oak improvement likely is increasing with the demand for improved varieties. The current study demonstrated the feasibility of post hoc assembly of full-sib families for genetic analysis...|$|R

Analysis was conducted on 251 parental trees and ± 200 seeds from 10 mother trees. Analysis using 12 microsatellite markers showed that mean number of detected allele (A) for all the parents and offspring was 8. 23 and 7. 08, repectively. In general, the level of genetic diversity in parental and its offspring was not different (He= 0. 609 for parental and He= 0. 606 for offspring). The presence of new alleles that was detected from offspring indicated the possibility of pollen contamination from outside the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard.</b> Keywords: Genetic diversity, South Sumatera seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard,</b> parental, offspring, microsatellite markers</p...|$|R

The {{study was conducted in}} two <b>seed</b> <b>orchards,</b> i. e. a first generation seedling <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> (F 1 SSO) of A. mangium, used as the parent population hereafter and a multi location trial (MLT) as an offspring population. Based on 10 microsatellite markers, mating system in the F 1 SSO was under panmictic equilibrium condition. The good growth trees in the MLT originated from various parent genes contribution in the F 1 SSO. Several behaviors were observed: a). the best trees in MLT dominantly originated from singlepair trees, between maternal and paternal trees, in F 1 SSO; b). a maternal tree was pollinated by two paternal trees; c). a paternal tree pollinated several maternal trees. Flowering synchronization and genetic compatibility among trees might be responsible for these mating system patterns. In order to maximize seeds production, studies on male and female flowers characteristic should be employed to assess flowering synchronization among individual trees in the <b>seed</b> <b>orchard...</b>|$|R
40|$|The natural pollen cloud {{moving around}} with the winds in early summer may account for 50 % of pollinations in mature <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> with high {{internal}} pollen production. The background pollen is genetically different from <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> pollen produced by selected plus trees. This may affect the adaptation of the seed crop and justify a modified use of the seeds, e. g. {{the best place to}} use the crop. However, even seeds from young <b>seed</b> <b>orchards</b> without pollen production may usually be useful forest regeneration material and there are reasons to limit or eliminate demands on high internal pollen production when <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> clones and contaminating pollen do not differ much in adaptation. Artificial freeze testing <b>seed</b> <b>orchard</b> crops of Scots pine for autumn cold hardening is often performed in Sweden to determine the area of utilization. In the same way the hardiness of the natural pollen cloud can be experimentally estimated using artificial freeze testing of progenies obtained from controlled wind pollination of selected clones. Therefore a number of permanent small clone archives of Scots pine have been established in central and northern Sweden as a basis for evaluating geographical and daily variation in the hardiness of the background pollen cloud. An archive of mobile grafts is also under establishment. One appli...|$|R
