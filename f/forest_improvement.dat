40|$|Healthy forests provide many {{benefits}} for private landowners and for society at large. Among these benefits are aesthetic beauty, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and timber income (Figure 1). However, many forests suffer from abuse and neglect. Livestock grazing; wildfires; poor logging practices; insects and disease; non-native invasive species; environmental stresses; and overly dense, slowly growing trees all compromise forest health and diminish a forest’s potential. Through <b>forest</b> <b>improvement</b> we can protect, sustain, and improve forest health, and achieve landowner goals. <b>Forest</b> <b>improvement</b> may simply involve fencing livestock {{out of the}} forest or preventing wildfires. Commonly, however, <b>forest</b> <b>improvement</b> includes timber stand improve-ment (TSI). TSI increases timber value through: 1. increasing the proportion of valuable timber tree species in a forest stand; 2. increasing the proportion of trees that have good timber form, high quality, and defect-free wood volume (i. e., crop trees); and 3. reducing the time it takes for crop trees to grow to maturity by increasing growth rates. TSI may also improve wildlife habitat; control invasive species; and enhance environmental, scenic, and recreational values of the forest.

40|$|Abstract Many forest-management {{practices}} have negative impacts on forest birds. Here we compare the bird communities between, first, an old-growth forest and a 30 -year-old monoculture conifer plantation, and secondly, an old-growth forest and an old-growth forest that was “improved ” silviculturally 9 years earlier. We collected data on tree species composition and variables important {{for analysis of}} forest structure. We sampled breeding birds using variable-distance transect and variable circular-plot methods, and recorded the microhabitat and food habits of each species. Results showed that the monoculture plantation held only 51. 5 % of the species found in old-growth forest. Bird species richness and density in the silviculturally improved forest were also lower than that in old-growth forest. Examining the avian guilds of these forest communities, we found that upperstory flycatching insectivores, upperstory gleaning insectivores, and ground-feeding omnivores all suffered severely in the managed forests, whereas upperstory trunk-probing insectivores and understory gleaning insectivores in-creased in numbers. Although the effects of <b>forest</b> <b>improvement</b> are less drastic for forest birds than conversion to monoculture, the alteration of forest structure still changed microhabitat and available resources.

Results are discussed with emphasys {{on the problems}} high selective rates may cause in <b>forest</b> <b>improvement.</b> Fifty one selected trees were evaluated through cloning and also through their respective half sibs progenies. Selections were effected in populations originated from Coff's Harbour-NSW-Australia under intensity of 1 : 5000, and from Zimbabwe, under intensity of 1 : 200. The following evaluations were made: a) Coff’s Harbour: flowereing period and species characteristics; means and ranges of variation of plant height at one year {{of age in the}} respective progenies; b) Zimbabwe: height and DBH means of the clones at 3. 5 years and at 2 years in the progenies. For the latter, the coefficient of correlation between the behavior of clones and progenies was calculated.

It was shown, for the Coff’s Harbour material, that some inferior progenies were also more heterogeneous. In addition, such progenies originated from trees of which clones were early flowering and were not typical for the species. For the Zimbabwe material, correlations between clone...|$|E

Among the potential species planted by the logging industry is guanandi (Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess) {{because it is}} widely distributed in the country, highly adapted to different soil and climate conditions, good bole form and high quality timber. The development of genetic improvement programs should prioritize gains in productivity and yields in the medium and long term.

To assess the viability of vegetative propagation of the species, two successive experiments were carried out during two years testing the best type of cutting, hormone concentration and management. Different cuttings types submitted to increasing doses of indole-butyric acid (IBA) were tested to evaluate survival, sprouting, rooting and callus formation.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} power {{relationships within}} forest conservation decision-making in Nova Scotia, Canada. Rather than {{rely on the}} ‘customary science’ of resource conservation largely based on biological and physical parameters, this analysis is steeped in the traditions of social science and policy analysis. This study’s central focus is the <b>Forest</b> <b>Improvement</b> Act (FIA) : 1962 - 1986. Forest conservation policies and legislative initiatives developed prior to FIA enactment such as the Small Tree Act (STA) : 1942 - 1965 are treated in this study as the FIA’s policy gestation period. Theoretical and practical insights derived from this pre-FIA period {{are used in the}} assessment of the FIA and these combined understandings are subsequently applied to the analysis of contemporary forest conservation policy. For contemporary analysis, six case studies including the Nova Scotia Envirofor process and the St. Mary’s River Landscape and Ecology Management proposal, as well as a recent provincial government initiative are examined. This study utilises a broad range of decision-making and resource management theory to tease out understandings of the particular character of the policy process. The analysis utilises various decision-making models, theories of power, and multi-agency decision making models as well as the Environmental Modernisation literature developed by Turner, O’Riordan and Weale and others. In addition to the investigative methodologies used generally throughout this study, the Envirofor and the St. Mary’s case studies employed a ‘participant observer’ approach that provided otherwise unavailable insights into these conservation initiatives. Regardless of policy content, this study shows that external forces such as woodfibre markets were key to the implementation of ground level forest conservation. Ironically, this study links the renewal of forest conservation legislation to the demand for increased forest exploitation. New forest policy initiatives were {{as much to do with}} pacifying conservation interests as they were about promoting ground level forest conservation...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{response}} of Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis var. mortonii) to range and <b>forest</b> <b>improvement</b> practices was studied {{on a stand}} of mixed-coniferous forest which was clear -cut and burned in 1963 and 1964, respectively. The field studies were conducted on the Hall Ranch of the Eastern Oregon Experiment Station during the summers of 1968, 1969, and 1970. Canada milkvetch, which was virtually absent {{at the time of}} treatment, {{became one of the most}} important herbaceous species. The cover, frequency, and density of this species rapidly increased from 1965 to 1967; thereafter, these parameters have decreased, even to the levels of 1965 in some cases. The influence of forest canopy and physical site factor s, viz., soil moisture, soil temperature, and hydrogen ion concentration of the soil were studied. Phenology of seedling, root systems, shoot and flower development, seed production and germination were investigated. Studies were also made on the effects of grazing as they influence flowering, plant height, yield and number s of plants. The population parameters which were studied included cover, frequency, and density. The effects of calcium, copper, and cobalt each alone and in all combinations were studied by growing plants in the greenhouse. In addition, nitrogen fixation and the effect of nitrogen upon root nodulation were examined. The environmental parameters that influence Canada milkvetch are soil moisture and temperature for root nodulation and soil moisture for pod ripening. Soil from areas dominated by Canada milkvetch has higher pH values than soils in the forest and lower values than soils dominated by introduced grass species. In the experimental area, the amount of organic materials on the soil can be correlated with the intensity of grazing. Canada milkvetch begins growth shortly after snow melts, flowers in late June and July, and pods ripen in August. Flowering may begin in early June and continue to September, but the ovaries of the flowers produced early or late abort, because pollination occur s only when a medium sized bumble bee (Bombus sp.) is the most active. This is the only species which trips the flowers of Canada milkvetch. The greatest amount of damage to the reproductive potential of Canada milkvetch is done by a weevil (Apion sp.) which lives within the developing pod. At least 50 percent of the pods were destroyed by this insect during the summers of 1968 and 1969. Untreated seeds germinate and produce seedlings at the rate of approximately five percent per month. The rate of germination can be greatly increased by moist heat, but the amount of hard seeds remaining decreases and the amount decayed seed increases. The effects of grazing on this species can be evaluated by plant height, dry weight yield per plant, total yield per unit area, and the number of blossoms per flower stalk. Cattle prefer the inflorescences, but graze the leaves and stems along with the associated species at approximately the same intensity of use. On the other hand, big cattle preferentially graze this species from the time it begins growth in early spring until the animals leave the area. Canada milkvetch was always more productive under a grazing regime of cattle only than under a regime of domestic plus wild animals. Because the vegetation of the experimental area is rather low in the successional hierarchy, rapid changes in the values of cover, frequency, and density have occurred. The importance of Canada milkvetch has steadily decreased since 1967 and the relative importance of grasses has increased. Calcium seems to be required for nutrition and nodulation rather than as an amendment to alter the pH of the soil. Low levels of copper and cobalt also increase growth. Further research is required to adequately define the effects of these elements alone and in combination. Perhaps the successional role of Canada milkvetch can be prolonged by adequate fertility. This research provides an example demonstrating that range and forestry improvement must be coordinated and management intensified in order to maximize the biological potential of a given area...|$|E
