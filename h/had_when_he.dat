5|$|As he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer {{attempted to}} modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This is much to the annoyance of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in {{his late}} teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In {{the early hours of the}} next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out of his desk drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E

He intended for the three dancers to be a metaphor for fishing lures, and for the single dancer to be {{a metaphor for the}} reel. The single dancer's actions were intended to imitate the action of casting a fishing rod. The reel used in the video is a Shimano Calcutta Conquest reel.|$|E

25|$|In 1917, George Kemp {{received}} a commission in the 15th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry. While serving with that regiment, {{he was wounded}} at Chérisy, Pas-de-Calais, France. His rank was that of second lieutenant, which he again <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1918. He was posted to No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Air Force. Kemp was credited with twelve aerial victories as an observer, all from the Bristol F.2b and with William McKenzie Thomson as his pilot.|$|E
25|$|Will Hutchins as Coley. As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins {{was cast}} in the same burst of {{inspiration}} that Hellman <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production Hutchins was already fully identified with the western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming man who never complained about the often adverse filming conditions.|$|E
25|$|Leosthenes (Greek: Λεωσθένης; died 323 BC) was an Athenian who was {{commander}} of the combined Greek army in the Lamian War. Leosthenes is usually identified {{as the son of}} that Leosthenes who had suffered exile in 362/1 BC and who had fled to the court of Philip II. It is unknown by what means he had obtained the high reputation he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first makes his appearance in history. It has been generally inferred, from a passage in Strabo, that he had first served under Alexander the Great in Asia; but it now seems certain that this is a mistake, and rather the reference should have been to Leonnatus.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} of the old {{allotment}} system, Sweden's involvement in the Thirty Years' War and the Northern Wars did not have a very large impact on the population in general. The armies of Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus and later Charles X had relatively large success due to the superior tactics used, and foreign mercenaries comprised large parts of the armies. Gustavus Adolphus <b>had,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> entered the Thirty Years' War, an army of 14,500 Swedish and Finnish conscripts and more than 20,000 enlisted foreigners, and deaths in the latter group did not affect the Swedish population. Charles XI's new allotment system did not have to see use in the first 20 years of its existence, which was also the longest time of peace Sweden had seen since its independence. Thus, the population continued to grow at a steady rate between 1620 and 1700.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

[...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was penned by Yankovic after he remembered the enjoyment he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> combined a classic rock track with a recent movie topic with his 1985 song [...] "Yoda". Yankovic decided to combine the plot of the recent movie Jurassic Park—a film about a park on a fictional island where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|In 1787, José Damian Ortiz de Castro was {{in charge}} of {{finishing}} work on the cathedral. He did most of the work on the bell towers, putting in most of the fretwork and capping them with roofs in the shape of bells. With his death in 1793, he did not live to see the cathedral completed, and Manuel Tolsá finished the cathedral by adding [...] the cupola, the central front facade, the balustrades, and the statues of Faith, Hope and Charity {{at the top of the}} front facade.

500|$|Jerome {{otherwise}} had a {{dim view of}} the Arabs. His prejudices {{were those}} of a native Roman. Born in Strido (in modern Croatia or Slovenia), near Aquileia, and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: [...] "Ciceronianus es, non Christianus", [...] "you are a Ciceronian, not a Christian". In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of Chalcis, he tells of the joy he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the [...] "barbarous" [...] languages of the natives (that is, Syriac and Arabic). From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Cold as Ice" [...] {{is based on}} a {{relationship}} Cox had with a girl named Alice. Having fallen in love with her in the fifth grade, he proposed to marry her on the school's playground. Alice rejected Cox, calling the ring he had given her [...] "a cheap piece of crap." [...] Years later, Cox worked with Alice at a Subway restaurant. Occasionally, [...] "for no reason", she would ask him to watch her change into her uniform in the restaurant's refrigerator, which he described as having been as [...] "cold as ice". Cox suspects that [...] "she was trying to torture me or something." [...] The song [...] "Bite Marks" [...] is about [...] "sadomasochism and boy prostitution." [...] In the song, Cox references an experience he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was kissing a man who bit him [...] "really, really hard" [...] on his shoulder, leaving bite marks [...] "for like two weeks." [...] This experience, along with other abuses he received as a child, formed the lyrical basis of the song.|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to the Tigers for spring training in 1952, Tigers' manager Red Rolfe noted, [...] "Artie could be our best pitcher. He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number he <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E
500|$|The script {{went through}} many changes {{before the final}} version. Lasseter decided Tinny was [...] "too antiquated", and the {{character}} was changed to a military action figure, and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut Buzz Aldrin). Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well as G.I. Joe action figures. In addition, the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear's suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite colors were green and purple respectively. Woody, the second character, {{was inspired by a}} Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter <b>had</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a child. Originally, Woody was a ventriloquist's dummy with a pull-string (hence the name Woody). However, character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy. John Lasseter liked the contrast between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately changed. Eventually, all the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were deleted, because the dummy was designed to look [...] "sneaky and mean." [...] However they kept the name Woody to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode. The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The Odd Couple, and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky (1986) for further influence.|$|E
