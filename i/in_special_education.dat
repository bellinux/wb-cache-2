40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct an {{evaluation}} of an alternative program <b>in</b> secondary <b>special</b> <b>education.</b> A variety of procedures, methods, and examples of effective alternative school programs are prevalent in the literature. However, there is a paucity of information related to the evaluation of alternative schools and programs <b>in</b> alternative secondary <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>in</b> the literature. It appears that evaluations of alternative secondary <b>special</b> <b>education</b> programs are not widely conducted. This evaluation study focused on evaluations of regular alternative education programs and synthesized their criteria for use in evaluating an alternative program <b>in</b> secondary <b>special</b> <b>education.</b> Criteria developed from four different models were used to evaluate an alternative program <b>in</b> secondary <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>in</b> a medium-size mid-western city. The evaluation revealed that the needs of the students seemed to be served as determined by the program 2 ̆ 7 s adequacy, quality, and effectiveness.

This study will contribute to the body of knowledge related to the evaluation and improvement of alternative programs <b>in</b> secondary <b>special</b> <b>education</b> by developing and conducting an evaluation of an alternative program <b>in</b> secondary <b>special</b> <b>education.</b> ...|$|R

It was during that experience that he decided to finish college and become a special education teacher. While attending college in Charlotte, he took a part-time job as an assistant to a boy with autism, and it was this child's mother, Diane Bubel, who urged him to audition for American Idol.

25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed <b>in</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were <b>in</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
