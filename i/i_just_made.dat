Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>made,</b> is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question.

2500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month break from writing and touring, the Wallflowers {{set out to}} make their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan was very diligent in the songwriting process; he rented a studio near his home and would {{routinely}} go there to write songs for the album. [...] However, Dylan was not satisfied with the first batch of songs he came up with. [...] He decided to scrap them and start over. [...] The songs that did make it to the studio were considered to be far more personal than any of the songs the Wallflowers had released in the past. [...] Dylan explained; [...] "I think all my songs are personal, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> them a little more dense before, made 'em real thick so that I didn't feel exposed. A lot of younger writers do that. [...] Before, I haven't really wanted anybody buying my records looking for information about myself or my family, but at this point, the group has a lot of people buying the records who aren't interested in that, so it gives me more freedom." [...] By the end of 1999, the Wallflowers were ready to begin recording. [...] The bulk of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. [...] The Wallflowers' longtime manager, Andrew Slater co-produced the album with Michael Penn. [...] The band took their time in the studio. [...] Like Bringing Down the Horse, (Breach) took about eight months to record. [...] (Breach) also featured an array of guest artists including Elvis Costello, Mike Campbell and Frank Black.|$|E
