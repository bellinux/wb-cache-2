5|$|Since 1999, {{the leading}} Hubble {{outreach}} group in Europe {{has been the}} Hubble <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> Agency Information Centre (HEIC). This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a videocast series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.|$|E
40|$|African {{presence}} in Europe {{can be traced}} back to Roman times, yet African peoples within <b>European</b> <b>spaces</b> are continually perceived and often treated as new migrants with no sense of an historical attachment to European soil. This paper seeks to understand and challenge this conception of black migrants to Europe by focusing on the community and political activities of black subjects in <b>European</b> <b>spaces.</b> Using Britain as a primary reference point, the paper argues that the unfolding nature of black political activity in <b>European</b> <b>spaces</b> emerges as a result of dynamic interactions between black protagonists and the state. The nature of these interactions it is argued are racialized in character and that black community organizations and individuals play a crucial role in determining the forms and nature of political activity and outcomes that operate under the guise of minority ethnic mobilization. This paper argues a point that is often overlooked in the literature that focuses on African and other immigrants to Europe as recent migrants with problems. The paper uses a refined political opportunities approach and focuses on state practices and black community organizational practices between the First and Second World Wars to outline the varied nature of black community and political activity in an era of state antagonism towards black populations at home and abroad. The paper argues that context, state power and action, and the activities and ideas of black community organizations interact in dynamic ways to account for the changing nature of black political activity in <b>European</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space</b> {{actually}} exists for quite a long time, the actual emancipation of the Commission from national governments has placed the development of such a space on a radically different trajectory. This new space seems to complement a basically intergovernmental order with highly visible elements of a Union administration that spans levels of governance, partly circumventing national ministries. It has to be understood that the extent of administrative activity in the <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> can only be fully appreciated if the traditional external point of view is supplemented with an internal one. It leads to a view of the <b>European</b> administrative <b>space</b> not as being two superimposed territorial structures; rather, this space can be seen to have developed over time, on one hand, a de-territorialisation of the exercise of power, and on the other hand, the establishment of a network of integrated administration. The emergence of integrated administration has an impact on criteria for accountability. The above analysis will lead us to some extremely interesting conclusions in order to better understand the full concept of the <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space.</b> <b>European</b> Administrative <b>Space...</b>|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 s {{numerous}} {{significant changes}} took place that reshaped Europe both politically and culturally: {{the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the breakdown of Yugoslavia. All these events changed <b>European</b> <b>spaces,</b> and for the first time, since the Second World War, European borders became unstable. This raised questions concerning what Europe is {{and what it means to}} be European. This quest for a new European identity is reflected in contemporary European cinema. This is particularly true of the boom in road movies that occurred in the 1990 s. These movies can be defined by their attempt to engage with new <b>European</b> <b>spaces.</b> In this thesis I will analyse three European road movies from the 1990 s. Each of them engage with the new <b>European</b> <b>spaces</b> and reflect upon a quest for a European identity. I will look at the imagined spaces in the films and discuss how the representations construct, comment on and reimagine a European identity. The films are Lisbon Story (1994) by Wim Wenders, Europa (1991) by Lars von Trier and Zugvögel- [...] . einmal nach Inari (1996) by Peter Lichtefeld The choice to use road movies to examine questions about the European spatial identities is justified by the fact that this cinematic form has the ability to mirror and interpret changes such as shifting European borders and the formations of national and transnational identities. The road movie has many shapes, different styles and is often mixed with other genres, but the road movie has one basic core: The journey as a cultural critique, as exploration both of society and of self. ...|$|R
