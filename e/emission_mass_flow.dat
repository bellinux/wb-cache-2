40|$|Agriculture, {{especially}} animal husbandry, is a {{major source}} of the greenhouse gas methane as well as the gas ammonia. In order to develop reduction measures for emissions and immissions, two factors prove to be: firstly, to determine the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> from livestock buildings, and secondly, to understand the dispersion processes in its surroundings. The quantification of emissions from livestock buildings with naturally ventilation is a particularly difficult task. The experimental uncertainties are largely unknown but are expected to be considerable. Using poor quality emission data as model input in dispersion studies (wind tunnel or numerical simulations) will produce results with limited significance. Accordingly a field study has been conducted to quantify the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> from naturally ventilated livestock buildings. During two field campaigns in summer tracer gas experiments and measurements of gas concentrations within and around two naturally ventilated cow sheds in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern were carried out, in order to estimate the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> It was found that the measured concentrations within the livestock building strongly depend on outside conditions such as e. g. the wind direction. Large uncertainties also arise from estimates of the air ventilation rate, which determines the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> The data analysis shows high estimated ventilation rates of 1280 - 1380 m 3 /h/LU (1 LU = 500 kg body weight) for cow shed 1 and 1140 - 1180 m 3 /h/LU for cow shed 2. These results suggest ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates of about 4 g/h/LU for cow shed 1 and about 2 g/h/LU for cow shed 2, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{air volume flow}} rates is important in estimating {{the environmental impact of}} airborne emissions from stables. In contrast to mechanically ventilated stables the amount of air exchange is variable in open stables and depends on the wind velocity and wind direc-tion. Statistics on the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> of naturally ventilated stables are not available, im-provements for analysing the measured data are necessary. This work shows a new method to overcome these disadvantages. The used calculation method is applied in the medical area since some decades {{but for the first time}} in agriculture to calculate the air volume flow. The method of compartmentalisation increases the quality of air flow calculation measurements and gives the possibility to check the results of other techniques. This allows to define and decrease the error level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dual fueled engine test {{procedures}} and result interpretation {{are not available}} in the literature, This paper describes a methodology for calculating the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates, using the chemical reaction mass balance of the components. The experimental data were obtained from tests made at the MWM dynamometer. Starting from basic principles, the hydrocarbon (HC) mass flow rate was related to molar concentration through the molecular mass and the exhaust gas mass flow rate, and compared to the available expressions in the EPA diesel engine test standard. The dual fuel model was established by a linear combination for the hydrocarbon (HC) equivalent molecular mass, when there is 0 % and 100 % natural gas in the fuel. Finally, the paper shows that, by a similar methodology, the natural gas mass flow rate can be calculated from emission measurements...|$|E

Primary and secondary observational features that a proposed flare model should be capable of explaining are discussed, including energy storage and release, particle acceleration, mass ejection, heating of the temperature minimum region, X-ray, EUV, UV, visible and radio <b>emission</b> and <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> Consideration is then given to the twisted flux tube paramagnetic recombination model of Gold and Hoyle (1960), the current model of Alfven and Carlqvist (1967), closed current-sheet models {{such as those of}} Syrovatskii (1966, 1969, 1977) and Uchida and Sakurai (1977), open-field models such as those of Carmichael (1964) and Barnes and Sturrock (1972), the emerging flux model of Heyvaerts and Priest (1974, 1977, 1978) and the loop-flare models of Spicer (1977) and Colgate (1978).

40|$|Open stable {{systems with}} outdoor yards {{are used in}} organic cattle farming. Until now there are no {{emission}} factors in Germany for outdoor yards of dairy barns or of cattle barns generally. The measuring of the emission potential of gaseous substances (NH 3, CO 2, N 2 O and CH 4) is difficult {{because of the size}} of the outdoor yards and the direct access by climate. One possibility to measure those emissions is the use of an active sampling hood. The sampling hood provides defined laminar exhaust airflow. The product of flow rate and concentration results in the <b>emission</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> In a preliminary study six cattle in calf with a total of 7. 19 GV had access to an outdoor yard. This was divided virtually in a 9 x 11 à 1 m² grid. To each m² a dirt level (clean, slightly, medium and heavily soiled) has been assigned. The grid area was sampled randomly. The influence of a scraper was investigated, too. The levels of dirtiness were allocated to the NH 3 emission mass flows. Based on the rating the results of the random samples were transferred on the partial area of the entire outdoor yard. The outcome of this is an emission factor for NH 3 of 3. 02 kg/GV*a for the outdoor yard before the scraper was used and 2. 79 kg/GV*a afterwards. The preliminary results show that measuring NH 3 emissions by an active sampling hood is practicable for the use at outdoor yards of cattle barns...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} fuel/air inlet {{diameter}} {{as well as}} air preheating on the flame stability, temperature distribution, pollutant formation, and combustion characteristics of a lab-scaled asymmetric vortex flame have been investigated. A three-dimensional steady-state finite volume solver {{has been used to}} solve the governing and energy equations. The solver uses a first-order upwind scheme to discretize the governing equations in the space. The semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations has been applied to couple the pressure to the velocity terms. Several turbulence models were applied to predict the flame temperature and it was found that k-ε RNG has given the best results in accordance with the experimental results. The results reveal that the inlet air diameter can enhance the thermal properties and reduce the NOx emission while the inlet fuel diameter has less significant impact. Increasing diameters are accompanied with a pressure drop. It was found that preheating the air and fuel would significantly affect the flame temperature and NOx <b>emission</b> with constant <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{semiconductor}} and display industries {{have tried to}} reduce the emissions of perfluorocompounds (PFCs) from the globally environmental regulation. Total amount of PFC emission can be calculated from the flow rate and the partial pressures of PFCs. For the precise measurement of PFC <b>emission</b> amount, the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> controlled helium gas was continuously injected into the equipment of which scrubber efficiency is being measured. The partial pressures of PFCs and helium were accurately measured using a mass spectrometer in each sample extracted from inlet and outlet of the scrubber system. The flow rates are calculated from the partial pressures of helium and also, PFC destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of the scrubber is calculated from the partial pressure of PFC and the flow rate. Under this method, the relative expanded uncertainties of the flow rate and the partial pressures of PFCs are ± 2 % (k = 2) in case the concentrations of NF 3 and SF 6 are as low as 100 μmol/mol...|$|R

40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of automated monitoring, control and optimization systems for mineral processing applications require accurate online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements from the processes. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. Belt scale {{is the most common}} online bulk material <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor used in the mineral processing. The belt scale provides an accurate online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements of the belt scales, offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors against the reference <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement of the belt scale. The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors used in this work are a power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant. An aggregate production plant is used as an example of mineral processing application in this work. The presented online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors can also be applied to other mineral processing applications handling solid materials on belt conveyors. The results of this work indicate that all of the measurement signals of the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensors correlate well with the reference <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurement of the belt scale. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> estimation models of the power transducer and laser profilometer were proven accurate. The results indicate that the online <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> measurements can be utilized more effectively in the process control and optimization of the mineral processing plants.

A 75 -cm long cylindrical Perspex column with a 4 cm diameter was used. Only 48 cm of the column was utilised as the active direct contact condensation height. Pentane vapour at three different initial temperatures (40 °C, 43. 5 °C and 47. 5 °C), with differing <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates, and tap water at a constant initial temperature (19 °C) with five different <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates were employed as the dispersed phase and the continuous phases, respectively.

40|$|Industry {{interest}} in variable-thrust liquid rocket engines places a demand on engine injector technology to operate {{over a wide}} range of liquid <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates and chamber backpressures. One injection technology of current interest for variable thrust applications is an injector design with swirled fluids. Current swirl injector design methodologies do not take into account how swirl injector design parameters respond to elevated chamber backpressures at less than design <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The current work was created to improve state-of-the-art swirl injector design methods in this area. The specific objective was to study the effects of elevated chamber backpressure and off-design <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates on swirl injector fluid mechanics. Using a backpressure chamber with optical access, water was flowed through a swirl injector at various combinations of chamber backpressure and <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The film thickness profile down the swirl injector nozzle section was measured through a transparent nozzle section of the injector. High speed video showed measurable increases in the film thickness profile with application of chamber backpressure and <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates less than design. At prescribed combinations of chamber backpressure and injected <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate, a discrete change in the film thickness profile was observed. Measured injector discharge coefficient values showed different trends with increasing chamber backpressure at low <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates as opposed to near-design <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rates.
