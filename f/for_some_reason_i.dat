500|$|Responding to the criticism, {{one of the}} film's producers, Elie Samaha, complained: [...] " [...] {{critics were}} waiting for us to… chop our heads off. Everybody hated Scientology <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know people were so prejudiced." [...] Ebert noted, however, that the film [...] "contains no {{evidence}} of Scientology, or any other system of thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. I think he got some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want {{to leave me alone}} <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
500|$|Hill {{spent four}} months {{designing}} and seven months building another home-built dragster called the Double Dragon. The machine had two engines, with each engine having its own ring gear and pinion, clutch, and driveshaft. He used four rear racing slick tires in open competitions for faster passes, and two rear slicks in match competitions to produce smokier passes. The machine ripped up {{the starting line}} at the 1961 NHRA Nationals at Indianapolis. In 1962, Hill ran [...] two years after Chris Karamesines had the first [...] pass and two years before Don Garlits had the first official [...] rpass. A speed or e.t. record is first certified official after it is backed up by a different pass within one percent. Hill built his first Top Fuel dragster in 1963 using a Pontiac engine. He had nearly completed a jet-engine powered ultralight dragster in 1963 when the NHRA outlawed all aircraft engines. He built two more Top Fuel Hemi-powered dragsters before he had an engine fire at Green Valley Race City in 1966. [...] "It {{was one of those}} fireballs that you couldn't see through," [...] Hill said. [...] "I locked up the brakes, and it felt like I needed to turn the wheel to the left, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> didn't. I had to do something that was counterintuitive, and it spooked me." [...] Hill had managed to steer straight down a course that was lined with trees. Hill had been using the Double Dragon to win matches, which were used to finance his Top Fuel dragster. The Double Dragon had been destroyed in a wreck two months before this fire. The fire tapped his finances and his resolve to drag race.|$|E

But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have misunderstood me <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> was always one of the most competitive kids around." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was bitterly {{opposed to}} secret societies, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> which <b>I</b> never fully understood, {{and the only}} fury I ever knew him to express was {{directed}} against these [...] "dens of iniquity." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot omit {{to mention}} here a {{proposal}} {{made a few}} years ago to the late Lord Treasurer Godolphin for re-peopling this forest, which <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> can be more particular in than any man now left alive, because I had the honour to draw up the scheme and argue it before that noble lord and some others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over--or, rather, providing for when they were come over--the poor inhabitants of the Palatinate, a thing in itself commendable, but, as it was managed, made scandalous to England and miserable to those poor people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said, [...] "I {{could only}} {{think that there}} was robbery, and that you, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> {{sufficient}} <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> am sure, were aiding. I could not think anything else, could I?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Sermons {{were long}} and harrowing. [...] In vivid language, the preacher painted Heaven and Hell, with {{considerably}} more emphasis on Hell than upon Heaven. [...] I mentally pictured the Devil as a monstrous red animal with horns and a long tail, who carried a four-pronged pitchfork. [...] <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> believed {{he lived in the}} ground and could appear at will. [...] The church had no organ or piano, so we sang without instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Havins {{prepared}} for the birth scenes beforehand as well. [...] "I got books and spoke to my mom," [...] she said. [...] "Everyone that had a child I was picking their brain, {{and there were some}} really great things online that helped." [...] Havins stated, [...] "And <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> have always watched Maternity Ward on TLC and just to see it firsthand was great. I wanted it to be no makeup, no lip gloss...I wanted to make it [...] real." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now <b>for</b> <b>some</b> occult <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> shrank {{from asking}} {{the name of}} this [...] "one who had gone down to the Darkness," [...] {{although}} I was sure that she was waiting for the question. So I merely remarked, without showing surprise-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, please! I {{see that}} you know. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> mysterious <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> am {{travelling}} almost alone, and under another name which I do not like at all. You are very fond of my cousin, Isobel, are you not, Mr. Greatson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>I</b> {{could never}} discover, the dominie had {{all his life}} refused to teach his {{scholars}} geography. The Inspector and many others asked him why there was no geography class, and his invariable answer was to point to his pupils collectively, and reply in an impressive whisper-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I put it {{a little}} strongly," [...] he replied. [...] "You seemed to take an {{interest}} in him, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> suppose it's because you like new types." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{not going}} to write any more to-night," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{not in the mood}} for it <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> can't say what I want to say." ...|$|E
60|$|She wore nothing {{over her}} evening dress save a lace scarf, which she {{untwisted}} as we ascended the stairs. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> fancied {{that she was}} not very well pleased with me. Her greeting was certainly cool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what's {{in the air}} always HAS--hasn't it?--to {{come down}} to the earth. And Maggie," [...] Mrs. Assingham continued, [...] "is a very curious little person. Since I was 'in,' this afternoon, for seeing more than I had ever done--well, I felt THAT too, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> as <b>I</b> hadn't yet felt it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to {{be quite}} {{mistress}} of myself," [...] she explained; [...] "your face, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> which <b>I</b> really don't know, irritates me. The fact is, I have great pride in keeping my temper. Please make allowances. Now about Miss Jillgall. I suppose she told you how my sister first met with Philip Dunboyne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} girl, [...] "it {{would not be}} strange, of course; but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> inexplicable <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> {{have one of those}} foolish {{feminine}} presentiments that all is not right with Mr. Caldwell. It is the strangest feeling--it is as though I knew that he was not on board the ship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows! He {{hates me}} <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> have never gone against his wishes, save in one respect, {{and in that}} I can never obey him, for {{it is a matter}} in which he has no right to command." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> drew Harry with me. It {{may have}} been that I felt {{the company of a}} comrade of my own kind would be comforting in that assembly; and then I forgot {{everything}} as, fixing her bright eyes on me, Grace held out her hand.|$|E
6000|$|It was awfully {{quiet and}} dark and lonely, out there by that creek, when the light had been put out, and we had gone to bed. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> could not go to sleep. After I had been lying awake {{for an hour or}} two, Euphemia spoke: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes! He refused. He {{said that}} he must stay here, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> mysterious <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> begged him {{to tell me what}} that reason was, and he was silent. It was the end. He gives me no confidence. He has refused the one effort I made at reconciliation. I am {{convinced}} that it is useless. We have parted finally." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> which <b>I</b> cannot now remember, I {{was not in}} {{my usual}} good spirits that evening. The noisy music jarred on my nerves, {{the sight of the}} gaping crowd round the {{platform}} irritated me, the blandishments of the painted ladies of the profession of pleasure saddened and disgusted me. I opened my cigar-case, and turned aside into one of the quiet by-walks of the Gardens.|$|R
6000|$|Bridge {{stretched}} luxuriously. [...] "'There,'" [...] he repeated. [...] "I've {{been searching}} for THERE for many years; but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> can never get away from HERE.

6000|$|The undisguised amusement, {{mingled with}} relief, that had overspread Barker's face during this lively recital might have pricked the {{conscience}} of Mrs. Horncastle, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> fear it did not.

6000|$|Philip {{shook his}} head. [...] "I fail to admire either of them, {{although}} I least {{of any one}} should cast a presumptuous stone. Perhaps I am unduly prejudiced. I have known several hyphenated Jones people before, and <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> never got on with them. You see I was always addressing the wife as plain Mrs. Jones--perpetually overlooking the lean-to addition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"After my husband's corpse {{was brought}} home, I sent to Tyler, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> had, {{to come and}} see the corpse.

I will tell my reasons if you gentlemen ask me, in the face of Tyler, even if my life should be in danger for it. When I was ironing a shirt, on the Saturday night my husband was murdered, something came over me--something rushed over me--and I thought my husband came by me. I looked up, and I thought I heard the voice of my husband come from near my mahogany table, as I turned from my ironing. I ran out and said, 'Oh dear God! my husband is murdered, and his ribs are broken.' I told this to several of my neighbours. Mrs. Chester was the first to whom I told it. I mentioned it also at the Saracen's Head." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{days have}} {{been full of}} {{national}} movement.
