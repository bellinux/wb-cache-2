5000|$|The {{mimeograph}} machine, which forced ink {{through a}} wax paper stencil {{cut by the}} keys of a typewriter, was the standard for many decades. A second-hand mimeo could print hundreds of copies and (with {{more than a little}} effort) print in color. The <b>electronic</b> <b>stencil</b> cutter (shortened to [...] "electrostencil" [...] by most) could add photographs and illustrations to a mimeo stencil. A mimeo'd zine could look terrible or look beautiful, depending more on the skill of the mimeo operator than the quality of the equipment. Only a few fans could afford more professional printers, or the time it took them to print, until photocopying became cheap and ubiquitous in the 1970s. With the advent of computer printers and desktop publishing in the 1980s, fanzines began to look far more professional. The rise of the internet made correspondence cheaper and much faster, and the World Wide Web has made publishing a fanzine as simple as coding a web page.|$|E
