25|$|Also unlike modern P2P services, the {{identity}} of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a <b>downloader</b> is identifiable to all others by their network address. On Usenet, the <b>downloader</b> connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the Recording Industry Association of America. The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to <b>downloaders.</b> With these systems, {{a large number of}} <b>downloaders</b> for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the more <b>downloaders</b> the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, <b>downloaders</b> help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.|$|R

50|$|P4P, or {{proactive}} {{network provider}} participation for P2P, {{is a method}} for internet service providers (ISPs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) software to optimize peer-to-peer connections.

Because Windows Media Video 9 is an {{implementation of the}} Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) VC-1 standard, Silverlight also supports VC-1 video. According to the {{end user license agreement}} VC-1 and H.264 are only licensed for the [...] "personal and non-commercial use of a consumer". Silverlight makes it possible to dynamically load Extensible Markup Language (XML) content that can be manipulated through a Document Object Model (DOM) interface, a technique that is consistent with conventional Ajax techniques. Silverlight exposes a <b>Downloader</b> object which can be used to download content, like scripts, media assets, or other data, as may be required by the application. With version 2, the programming logic can be written in any [...]NET language, including some derivatives of common dynamic programming languages like IronRuby and IronPython.|$|E

50|$|Related to {{download}} managers {{are two other}} breeds of Internet programs, file-sharing peer-to-peer applications (eMule, BitTorrent, Gnutella) and stream recorders (such as StreamBox VCR). While download managers are designed to give users greater control over downloads, some <b>downloaders</b> are created to give that control to content distributors instead. Some software companies, for example Adobe, provide such <b>downloaders</b> for downloading software on their own site. Presumably this increases reliability and reduces their technical support costs. A possible reason is increasing the control over redistribution of their software (even when the software is freeware).|$|R
