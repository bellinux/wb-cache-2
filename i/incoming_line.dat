25|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200–400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to preheat the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom–substrate and adatom–film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers. To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve geometric shadowing, where <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|E

30|$|The {{rationality}} {{can also}} be verified by comparative analysis between two nodes. For example, node 5 and 9 have {{the same number of}} <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>lines.</b> Flow value rankings of two <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> and two outgoing lines of node 5 are 2 nd, 7 th and 4 th, 6 th. Flow value rankings of two <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> and two outgoing lines of node 9 are 9 th, 13 th and 14 th, 17 th. Therefore, node 5 is more important than node 9 for larger power flow values of its <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>lines.</b> In method 1, the importance rankings of two nodes are 3 rd and 6 th, which accord with actual situation. However, in method 2, the importance rankings of two nodes are much closer {{due to the fact that}} they have the same number of outgoing and <b>incoming</b> <b>lines.</b> It is unreasonable. Similarly, the analysis can be applied to nodes 2 and 6. It shows that node importance ranking of power grid without consideration of power flow is determined by the topology of power grid to a greater extent. It is inconsistent with practical situation of power grid.|$|R
30|$|Node 70 ranks at 14 th and 6 th in methods 2 and 3, respectively. However it ranks only at 63 rd in method 1. This node has 2 <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> and 3 {{outgoing}} lines. Flow {{values of}} <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>lines</b> are very small. They just rank at 74 th, 152 nd and 118 th, 161 st, 168 th, respectively. This node {{is connected to}} a load and a generator. The output of the generator just ranks at 24 th of total 54 generators. The load ranks at 22 nd of total 99 loads. The above facts result in a lower ranking of this node in method 1. Similarly, node 19 ranks 19 th in method 3 but 83 rd in method 1. Flow value rankings of its outgoing and <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> are 111 th, 135 th, 175 th and 150 th. The output of generator connected to it ranks at 29 th. And the capacity of load connected to it ranks at 34 th.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the disparity upsampling, the incoming pixel stream is downsampled and forwarded to the next lower stage. A synchronization buffer between incoming pixel values and the corresponding incoming offsets is needed. This buffer temporarily stores the <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> until the respective disparities from the lower-resolution stage are available.|$|R
50|$|The plastic pin adds a {{presence}} function. When not inserted into a jack, the jack itself (mechanically) connects the <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> {{to the next}} socket. The article on the Swedish telephone plug details its functional principles.|$|E
50|$|For greater security, an {{additional}} round turn {{may be taken}} above the first before the line's working end is brought back under itself, creating a double becket or figure-of-eight becket. In the figure-of-eight becket hitch, the working {{end of the line}} is also passed through the becket loop, wrapped around the becket then under itself, but then the line is wrapped in the opposite direction over the <b>incoming</b> <b>line,</b> but tucked under and inside the first wrap to align with the length of the becket. The figure-of-eight becket hitch contains 2 bends: one bend around under the becket, and the other bend under and over the <b>incoming</b> <b>line,</b> then tucked under inside the first bend.|$|E
50|$|This is {{particularly}} designed for mode 3 connection. The <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> to the mode 3 device is connected using pair one, and pair two {{is used as}} the outgoing line to other devices. If the mode 3 device is unplugged, the switch contacts maintain line connection to the other devices.|$|E
50|$|Before {{a manual}} {{exchange}} was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate PBX hunting groups were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number groups have PBX hunting facility, and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a hunting group {{have to be}} in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 & 2720; and the PBX hunting group on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and PBX hunting groups requiring more than 10 <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> would be served by special 11-and-over PBX final selectors which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.|$|R
50|$|Large 1A2 {{installations}} {{had multiple}} wiring closets fed by branch cables {{extended from the}} central closet where the KSU was located. An example {{of this type of}} installation would be a multi-story building. The KSU and <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> might be in the basement, while each floor had a branch wiring closet to which the telephones on that floor were connected.|$|R
50|$|On May 24, 2012, KSIQ's booster {{went off}} the air yet again. This was {{simultaneous}} with KPBS-FM's report that their transmitter, also on San Miguel, had lost power, apparently due to a brush fire that affected the <b>incoming</b> <b>lines.</b> However KPBS's signal was restored the next day, while KSIQ's booster was not {{back on the air}} until July 11, 2012, almost two months later.|$|R
50|$|A tie-off {{generally}} involves {{wrapping the}} line round a fixed object once or twice, {{and may be}} made more secure by adding a lock, which is made by looping the reel around the <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> and taking up the slack, before continuing the lay. A lock also puts the incoming and continuing {{parts of the line}} in contact, which makes it much easier to follow by feel.|$|E
50|$|The Model 28 Tape Punches, {{also known}} as a tape perforators, are receiving-only five-level devices that is {{actuated}} by <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> signals and perforates standard 11/16 inch paper tape. These tape punches are self-contained and motor-driven, operating at speeds up to 100 words-per-minute. The Model 28 family of tape punches includes the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR).|$|E
5000|$|A {{power supply}} was either mounted within the panel or {{separately}} nearby. The power supply provided 24 VDC for relay operation, filtered 24 VDC for talk battery (intercom and direct-line services), 10 VAC for lamps, 18 VAC for buzzers, and 90-110 VAC at [...] for ringers. [...] Lamp and signaling voltages were routed through a mechanical interrupter, to create lamp flash (<b>incoming</b> <b>line),</b> lamp wink (hold), and interrupted buzzer and ringing.|$|E
5000|$|Due to a {{limitation}} of the 16-bit architecture of MS-DOS, Major BBS was limited {{to a maximum of}} 255 <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> (plus one 'local console'). In practice, it was extremely difficult to scale to this level due to the 16MB RAM limitation of the Phar Lap 286 memory extender in use, as well as the physical limitations on connecting 255 modems to a single computer.|$|R
50|$|Material Handling and Object Calculation: Most {{objects in}} NIAflow are {{connected}} by lines where each line represents a material transported from one object to another. Any number of <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> can {{be attached to}} an in-point of an object. During calculation, all incoming materials are blended into a new material. Calculations are dependent {{on the type of}} object. At the conclusion of object calculation, the resulting material product(s) are connected to the out-point(s) of the object.|$|R
30|$|Node 30 is {{connected}} to no load or generator. However, nodes 8 and 26, whose importance ranks at 7 th and 26 th, are connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> are 7 th, 20 th. Nodes 17 and 38, whose importance ranks at 23 rd and 24 th, are also connected to node 30. The flow value rankings of the two corresponding outgoing lines are 9 th, 29 th. Therefore, node 30 ranks at 18 th in method 1 because not only authority scores and hub scores of its adjacent points but also the weights of its <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>lines</b> are large. It reflects the key idea of MBCC-HITS algorithm.|$|R
50|$|In a {{multidrop}} line arrangement (a central computer and different terminals {{in which the}} terminals share a single communication line {{to and from the}} computer), the system uses a master/slave polling arrangement whereby the central computer sends message (called polling message) to a specific terminal on the outgoing line. All terminals listen to the outgoing line, but only the terminal that is polled replies by sending any information that it has ready for transmission on the <b>incoming</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{power supply}} {{for the system}} is drawn from two Taiwan Power Company 161 kV {{supplies}} at three Bulk Supply Substations (BSS); one <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> serves as the main power supply while the other serves a backup. One substation (A8) is located between Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Linkou. The main RC structure was completed in March 2011, while civil engineering was finish {{at the end of}} October. The automatic fare collection system contract was awarded to Mercuries Data Systems (MDS) on October 22, 2010 for NT$355 million.|$|E
50|$|These {{changes will}} assign to each <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> a {{dedicated}} track, without any intersections between the lines. In particular, tracks 1 and 2 {{are assigned to}} the line from Trieste, tracks 3 and 4 to the Udine line, 5 and 6 to the Padua high speed line, 9, 10 and 11 to the original Padua line, and 12 and 13 to the lines for Adria and Trento. Finally, tracks 7 and 8 will be dedicated to those trains leaving or arriving at Venezia Mestre that do not also leave or arrive from Venezia Santa Lucia.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} {{ranking of}} node 59 is 5 th in method 1. The load of this node {{is the largest}} of this system (5.86  % of all loads in this system). This node has 4 outgoing <b>lines</b> and 3 <b>incoming</b> <b>lines.</b> One of the lines ranks at 18 th in line flow value ranking. This node is also connected to a generator. The output of the generator ranks at 12 th. However, node 59 cannot {{be found in the}} top 20 nodes of methods 2 and 3.|$|R
40|$|The M/ 1 -stage {{studied in}} this paper {{consists}} of M <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> who share a bus for the transmission of packets to an outgoing line. The capacity of the bus is DELTA-times higher {{than the speed of}} the <b>incoming</b> <b>lines.</b> The internal buffering is achieved by a common output buffer {{at the end of the}} bus. and by providing the crosspoints with small input buffers. The system is modeled as a finite capacity multi-queueing system with non-renewal input and cyclic non-exhaustive service discipline. The input processes belong to a class of tractable Markovian arrival processes (MAPs) introduced by Lucantoni, Meier-Hellstern and Neuts (1990), allowing the model to include bursty input traffic. Each buffer in the system is studied approximately by means of a finite capacity queue with repeated server vacations and limited service discipline, resulting in several performance measures of the system: the queue length distribution at an arbitrary time instant and at arrival instants for each queue, the loss probability of an arriving cell, the LST of the waiting time of an arriving cell. These results can be used to chose an optimal value for the factor DELTA, together with an accurate dimensioning of the buffers in the M/ 1 -stage, in order lo minimize the chip size and such that the required performances (cell delay, delay jitter, cell loss) are guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates Sasol Three (Secunda) system's {{needs for}} {{reactive}} power compensation under voltage and transient stability conditions. A short circuit limiting coupler is designed and the transient and voltage stability studies are performed with a short circuit limiting coupler (SLC) applied at the two 132 kV <b>incoming</b> supply <b>lines</b> from Eskom. The simulations are based 011 solving ordinary loadflow cases augmented with dynamic models of the system elements. Motor loads were modelled in detail incorporating their dynamic characteristics. 75 % of the Sasol Three system load constitute induction motors and 25 % is constant impedance and constant current load models. Power System Simulator (PSS/E) package was utilized in carrying out these studies. The most impressive results {{is the way the}} Sasol Three System recovers in the range of milliseconds when subjected to severe disturbance with regard to voltage and transient stability. With a short circuit limiting coupler included at the two <b>incoming</b> supply <b>lines,</b> the system still recovers after being subjected to a disturbance. In this project it is shown that {{there is no need to}} install {{reactive power compensation}} system on the Sasol Three System. This is because of the capabilities of the present system in regulating reactive power through the network during abnormal system conditions. It is also shown in this thesis that the Sasol Three network is transient and voltage stable when a short circuit limiting reactor is applied at the <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> from Eskom. The extent to which the-network is transiently stable is also determined...|$|R
5000|$|In {{railroad}} structures, {{and rail}} terminology, a wye (like the 'Y' glyph) or triangular junction is a triangular joining arrangement of three rail lines with a railroad switch (set of points) at each corner connecting to each <b>incoming</b> <b>line.</b> A turning wye {{is a specific}} case. Where two rail lines join, or in a joint between a railroad's mainline and a spur, wyes {{can be used as}} a mainline rail junction to allow incoming consists ability to travel either direction, or in order to allow trains to pass from one line to the other line.|$|E
5000|$|An {{automated}} {{call distribution}} system, commonly known as, {{automatic call distributor}} (ACD), is a telephony device that answers and distributes incoming calls to a specific group of terminals or agents within an organization. ACDs often use a voice menu to direct callers based on the customer's selection, telephone number, selected <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> to the system or time of day the call was processed. Computer telephony integration (CTI) and computer-supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) are intermediate software that can produce advanced ACD systems.

50|$|When {{there is}} only one socket in a house or apartment, the <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> is {{connected}} to the two lower receptacles and the upper receptacles are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one telephone socket, they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper receptacles of a socket to the lower receptacles of the next socket. When a connected telephone's handset is lifted the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.|$|E
40|$|The Dutch Health Inspectorate {{published}} a research {{report on the}} accessibility by telephone of Dutch general practices. A large proportion of Dutch GPs have not organized their practices according to standard norms as far as accessibility by telephone is concerned.

50|$|The goods yard is {{distinctly}} {{separated from}} the passenger station and {{is linked to the}} <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> by two lines connected in a triangle, starting {{from one end of the}} passenger station. This allows the goods yard to receive goods trains without having to occupy sections of line reserved for passenger services. At the end of the goods yard is the Centro Intermodale Merci (CIM), built at the turn of the twenty-first century, while along the track north of the triangle is the new Novara Nord railway station. Finally, the goods yard is linked with the Treno Alta Velocità (TAV) by a couple of tracks that are bypassed by the FNM line to Novara Nord.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of lines: internal lines connect two vertices, <b>incoming</b> <b>lines</b> extend from [...] "the past" [...] to a vertex and represent an initial state, and outgoing lines extend from a vertex to [...] "the future" [...] and represent the final state (the latter two are also known as external lines). Sometimes, {{the bottom of the}} diagram is the past and the top the future; other times, the past is to the left and the future to the right. When calculating correlation functions instead of scattering amplitudes, there is no past and future and all the lines are internal. The particles then begin and end on little x's, which represent the positions of the operators whose correlation is being calculated.|$|R
5000|$|This {{function}} is not generally supported by modular connectors. Modular connectors providing suitable switch contacts are available but not common; Instead, mode 3 devices use two modular connectors, {{one for the}} <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> {{and the other for}} the outgoing line. The convenience of using a single connector in this application is one reason for the continued use of 600 series connectors, but mixing this wiring scheme with modular connectors does not work well. For example, if a modern modem with its supplied 6P2C adaptor is plugged into a conventionally wired 611 mode 3 socket, the result is to disconnect all downstream devices.|$|E
5000|$|A key to many {{deductions}} in Slitherlink is {{that every}} point has either exactly two lines connected to it, or no lines. So if a point {{which is in the}} centre of the grid, not at an edge or corner, has three incoming lines which are X'd out, the fourth must also be X'd out. This is because the point cannot have just one line - it has no exit route from that point. Similarly, if a point {{on the edge of the}} grid, not at a corner, has two incoming lines which are X'd out, the third must also be X'd out. And if a corner of the grid has one <b>incoming</b> <b>line</b> which is X'd out, the other must also be X'd out.|$|E
50|$|The {{western end}} of the PEIR starts in Tignish, {{abutting}} Church Street which forms the downtown axis. A wye-junction {{just west of the}} end serves as a turnaround, running north to Maple Street. The line initially runs west-southwest out of town but soon turns south towards the northern edge of the original western terminus of the line at Alberton. Here the line folds back on itself, leaving town west-northwest almost parallel to the <b>incoming</b> <b>line,</b> an artifact of its later extension. The line originally bent south to run through town to the docks at Northport (now called Alberton South). The line to Northport was turned into a spur by building a large wye junction at the sharp curve that developed when the extension was added.|$|E
