5|$|But at {{that same}} moment this thought came into my mind. Don't let me find him! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that I could use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
500|$|A mutant, {{who is one}} of Xavier's earlier {{students}} and the leader of the X-Men in Cyclops' absence. Storm is a woman with the ability to manipulate the weather. [...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When I was a child, I felt that <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> change myself, my life would be better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following, the disability caused him some psychological pain. Dayan wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I reflected with considerable misgivings on my future as a cripple without a skill, trade, or profession to provide for my family." [...] He added that he was [...] "ready to make any effort and stand any suffering, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get rid of my black eyepatch. The attention it drew was intolerable to me. I preferred to shut myself up at home, doing anything, rather than encounter the reactions of people wherever I went." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot stay now, {{dear old}} friend," [...] {{said the other}} earnestly, [...] "on my honour I would do my duty by you now <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> have {{business}} {{of the utmost importance}} to transact to-day and must see to it forthwith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we might}} do worse, my son. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> believe that the Almighty listens to us an' {{troubles}} Himself about our small affairs, I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There it {{is again}} on the other side!' said the Snow-man, by which he meant the sun was {{appearing}} again. 'I have become quite accustomed to its glaring. I hope it will hang there and shine, so that I {{may be able to}} see myself. I wish I knew, though, how one ought to see about changing one's position. I should very much like to move about. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> would glide up and down the ice there, as I saw the boys doing; but somehow or other, I don't know how to run.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But how {{to attract}} the notice of the Englishmen! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage to catch Frank's face! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fling up my arms and sign to him to come! But he would not look! It was terrible! It was agonizing! ...|$|E
60|$|WINIFRED. Ah, yes!--ah, yes! <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{put it in}} my model.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, no, not if {{you tell}} of my abject {{courtship}} when I thought you a poor relation on a visit. My God! Sally, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> see this Ranger job through safely and to success!" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I've {{written all}} this, and it doesn't seem to amount to anything. But I {{do want to}} help, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> will enclose some scraps from my Autobiography--scraps about General Grant--they may be of some trifle of use, and they may not--they at least verify known traits of his character. My Autobiography is pretty freely dictated, but my idea is to jack-plane it a little before I die, some day or other; I mean the rude {{construction}} and rotten grammar. It is the <b>only</b> dictating <b>I</b> ever did, and it was most troublesome and awkward work. You may return it to Hartford.|$|R
6000|$|... "We mustn't {{break and}} run, of all things," [...] said Kurt. [...] "They'd burn the village. Tell our men {{to save their}} shells.... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> get some cracks at {{a bunch of them}} together--with this big shot-gun!" ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. I dont say you have, dear. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> persuade you Ive grown up, {{we should}} get along perfectly.|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA (sitting {{down and}} taking up her knitting). <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{be of some}} help to you! But it's always been so.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall know something, Dick." [...] Mr. Rover drew up {{his injured}} foot. [...] "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go after Arnold Baxter without delay!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're really awfully kind, Lancaster,' Berkeley {{answered}} warmly. 'No other fellow {{would do}} as much for Le Breton as you do. I admit he's absolutely impracticable, but I would give more than I can tell you <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> thought he <b>could</b> be made to pull through somehow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I would! oh, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could,</b> I'd be {{the happiest}} {{girl in the}} world! But I can't believe it, Emily. I heard Mrs. Taylor say that only the very best poetry paid, and mine is poor stuff, I know well enough." ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA. Oh! <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>COULD</b> {{go back to}} my flower basket! I {{should be}} {{independent}} of both you and father and all the world! Why did you take my independence from me? Why did I give it up? I'm a slave now, for all my fine clothes.|$|R
60|$|I {{think my}} wife is a little better. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get in trim, and get this work done, I should be quite chipper.|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get John Stumpy arrested, {{perhaps it}} would be {{possible}} to force him to make a confession. But how was this to be done? ...|$|E
6000|$|Nod laughed. [...] "Already am I in my brothers' {{thoughts}} Prince of Bonfires, Noddle of Pork; <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{see through}} Zut, they also might call me Eengenares, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{dare say}} my words are wild. I dare say they <b>only</b> mean that <b>I</b> loathe my luxury {{from the bottom}} of my soul, and long to be rid of it, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could,</b> without harm to others and with safety to myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what {{interests}} me," [...] she said. [...] "My dear, don't you think life tremendously interesting? I do. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write a novel. Between ourselves, I've tried. I had Mr. Dewing {{send it to}} a publisher, who said it was clever, but had no plot. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> get a plot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} was an avalanche," [...] said Armine, {{recovering}} first. [...] "It was most likely to be a great mass of ice tumbling off the arch {{at the bottom of the}} glacier. They do make a most awful row. I've heard one before, only not so near. Anyway we can't be far from the bottom of the glacier, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> crawl there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick {{told me to}} wait here; but {{how long}} shall I wait?" [...] I muttered. [...] "Something's {{happened}} to him. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see what that fire is doing!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hear what}} was said, both about myself {{and about the}} plan to be carried out! By hook or by crook I must get within hearing distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "It feels sore all over, and {{sometimes}} spins like a top. But I wouldn't {{care about that}} <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get that money back. Can't you and Spud go after that rascal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, cousin! cousin!" [...] {{said the}} girl, {{throwing}} herself into her arms. [...] "Is this true? Is James gone? Can't we do any thing? Can't we get him back? I've been thinking it over. Oh, if the ship wouldn't sail! and I'd go to Salem and beg {{him to come}} back, on my knees. Oh, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had <b>only</b> known yesterday! Oh, cousin, cousin! {{he wanted to talk}} with me, and I wouldn't hear him!--oh, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> had, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have persuaded him out of it! Oh, why didn't I know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, I know that; but, you see, {{there are}} Maura and Petros. They {{must not be}} thrown on Alexis, poor dear fellow! And <b>if</b> he could <b>only</b> be set free, he might go on with what he once hoped for, though he thinks it is his duty to give all that entirely up now and work obediently on. But I know the longing will revive, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> improve myself, and be worth more, it might still be possible.' ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{not heard}} a silence before in years. It was absolute. I raised myself on my elbow and listened to it. Sleep! I thought that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself <b>I</b> <b>could</b> compose myself to rest. I thought once that I heard a sound like the sail of a catboat {{flapping}} as it veered about in a breeze, but I {{decided that it was}} probably only a tack in the carpet. Still I listened.|$|R
6000|$|All this {{conversation}} with Retief I have set down in full, as nearly as I can remember it, {{because of its}} fateful consequences. Ah! if I could have foreseen; <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have foreseen! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just stumble {{into the}} {{entrance}} to that mine!" [...] thought Dave. [...] "What a fine thing {{it would be for}} Roger and his family! I know they need the money!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why not, daughter?" [...] he asked. [...] "And why can't a man succeed after he's seventy? I {{was only}} seventy this year. And mebbe I could succeed <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get to the}} Klondike--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Though I heard a woman {{declaring the}} other day that {{there ought to be a}} machine for them. Oh, the scenes that I {{encounter}} when I am marketing! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> describe them for Punch! I walked home once with our porter's wife, carrying two most brilliant sticks of rhubarb, all carmine stalk and gamboge leaf, and expressing a very natural opinion that the rhubarb tree must be very showy to look at, and curious to know in what kind of fruit the medicine grew.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{in making}} plenty of noise, and in wanting {{all they could}} get to eat. But they were little darlings, some of them, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> have got at them to make them a bit cleaner. Some of them looked {{for all the world}} like the little bronze images your Uncle has got in the museum, which he brought from Italy, and they hadn't a rag more {{clothing}} on either. They were in India. Dear, dear, to see them tumble about in the surf!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, of course, I couldn't bring them. They {{were little}} dirty things--I couldn't have them about; and, besides, they took {{up too much}} of her time; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this. She won't marry anybody else; and I do believe, now, though she knows how {{necessary}} she is to me, and how feeble my health is, she {{would go back to}} her husband tomorrow, <b>if</b> she <b>only</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> do, indeed," [...] said Marie; [...] "they are just so selfish, now, the best of them." ...|$|R
