5|$|Although {{sufficient}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> Railway's needs, the Nclass was {{an ideal}} test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from {{service for the}} application of experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E

Later that year, Ginsburg began a clerkship for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> District of New York, a position she held for two years.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> half of the territory.|$|E

Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000citizens and 159,000animals {{in the area of the}} expected impact. An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba was turned off to avoid accidents.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>southern</b> painted turtle.|$|E
