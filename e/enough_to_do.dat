5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so farther out.|$|E

To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E
5|$|Culann {{the smith}} invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar {{goes to the}} playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so {{impressed}} by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated {{by the loss of}} his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be Cú Chulainn—"Culann's Hound".|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

25|$|Anderson {{grew up in}} a semi-rural setting {{north of}} Seattle, in the town of Edmonds, Washington, where he'd been born on November 20, 1906. Some of his early {{paintings}} portrayed his family home. A piano was an important presence in his house. His father, Irving Anderson, was a carpenter-builder and also a musician. From an early age Guy was intrigued by other cultures; he was particularly fascinated by the woodcarvings of Northern Coastal native tribes, and by the collection of Japanese prints owned by his piano teacher. As soon as he was old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so on his own, he began commuting to the Seattle Public Library by bus to study art books.|$|E

25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} experts said that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} against Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was actually able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and give him more trouble than expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him or really ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut. Martínez, however, fought through the difficulty and eventually found openings {{which led to a}} knock-out of Barker, in the 11th with a right hook.|$|E
25|$|September {{began with}} an {{impressive}} pitching duel between Clayton Kershaw and Roy Oswalt. Kershaw struck out 11 batters but allowed two solo home runs and that was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> him in. Oswalt took a no-hitter into the sixth inning as the Phillies closed out the series with a 5–1 victory. The rival San Francisco Giants came to Dodger Stadium for the next series. Chad Billingsley welcomed them to town by throwing a two-hitter for eight innings and hitting a two-run single for the decisive runs in the Dodgers 4–2 victory. In the second game, Ted Lilly pitched a one-hitter through six innings and Jay Gibbons hit a three-run homer to stake the Dodgers to a 4–0 lead. However, the bullpen imploded again and Jonathan Broxton blew his sixth save of the season when Juan Uribe hit a two-run homer off him for a 5–4 Giants win.|$|E
25|$|Jones's {{studies of}} the Alhambra in Granada were pivotal in the {{development}} of his theories on flat pattern, geometry and polychromy. His travelling companion, Jules Goury, had recently been working with Gottfried Semper on his analysis of the polychromy of Ancient Greek buildings, and this was very likely a key factor in Jones embarking on such a scientific and detailed appraisal of the decoration at the Alhambra. Goury died of cholera – at the age of 31 – during their six-month stay at the Alhambra, and Jones returned to London determined to publish the results of their studies. The standard of colour printing at that time was not sophisticated <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to the intricate decoration of the Alhambra, therefore Jones undertook the printing work himself. Collaborating with chemists and printers, Jones took it upon himself to research the new process of chromolithography. He issued this labour of love, Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra, in twelve parts over a period of almost ten years, from 1836 to 1845. It was the world's first ever published work of any significance to employ chromolithography, and was to be a key milestone {{in the development of}} Owen Jones's reputation as a design theorist.|$|E
