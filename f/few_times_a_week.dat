The airport was a major distribution center for FedEx, which conducts flights daily within the state and northern Minnesota. FedEx moved their flight operations to Fargo, ND on October 31, 2016. The airport is one of the busiest airports in the country, due in large measure to the presence of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences of the University of North Dakota.|$|E

Scandinavian Airlines is the airline with the most domestic services to Trondheim. The main route is to its hub at Oslo; additional services are operated to Bergen, Bodø, Stavanger, Tromsø and Ålesund, all with Boeing 737, CRJ900 and ATR 72 aircraft. Internationally, it provides a weekly flight to Alicante, 2 times daily to its hub in Stockholm and 2 times daily flights to its hub in Copenhagen. Norwegian Air Shuttle is a low-cost airline which operates the main domestic services to Oslo, Bergen, using Boeing 737 aircraft. It provides a range of international flights.

40|$|The same {{questions}} about diet were asked in two community-based surveys {{conducted in the}} Hunter Region of New South Wales in 1983 and 1994. There were substantial changes in diet over the period; for example, the proportion of respondents who reported using low-fat or skim milk increased from 25 per cent to 51 per cent, the proportion eating meat <b>fewer</b> than five <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> doubled from 21 per cent to 42 per cent and the proportion eating fewer than three eggs per week increased from 55 per cent to 80 per cent. In both surveys, women reported eating a healthier diet than men, and older people and those of higher socioeconomic status reported better diets than younger people or people with less education or lower status occupations. The surprising finding was that over the 11 -year period the changes in patterns of food consumption were remarkably similar across all strata of the population. The conclusions are that wide-spread dietary change is possible. However, {{the changes in the}} last decade related mainly to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease; similar behavioural changes {{to reduce the risk of}} diet-related cancer are required...|$|R

Jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde Jazz program. He was described by a Homestead classmate as [...] "kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. He {{was smart enough to}} be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. He was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in. and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. He was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." [...] By his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann. In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate, Al. During the summer, Brennan, Jobs, and Steve Wozniak found an advertisement posted on the De Anza College bulletin board for a job that required people to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland. Brennan portrayed Alice while Wozniak, Jobs, and Al portrayed the White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{announcement}} {{was placed in}} a chaplaincy newsletter inviting chap-lains from the United States and Canada to participate in a survey about the spiritual needs of their patients. A total of 167 chaplains responded to the invita-tion and completed an on-line questionnaire. The questionnaire listed 28 spiri-tual needs that fell into seven categories. Chaplains were asked to rate how often they encountered patients with each of the needs, using a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 meaning “a <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year ” and 6 meaning “many <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. ” The re-sponses of chaplains indicated that the seven categories formed a hierarchy of needs. The most common, or prevalent, of the seven spiritual needs were the need for love and belonging, and the need to find meaning and purpose, which chap-lains encountered between “many <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> ” to “a <b>few</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:(i) To {{investigate}} the associations between the presence, number {{and severity of}} white spot lesions (WSLs) and patient characteristics. (ii) To {{investigate the}} associations between the presence, number and severity of WSLs and the saliva properties tested using the Saliva-Check BufferKit (GC Corp., Belgium). (iii) To evaluate {{the use of the}} DIAGNOdent pen (KaVo, Biberach, Germany) as an aid in the identification of WSLs in orthodontic patients. Method: With ethics approval, 91 orthodontic patients had de-identified parameters recorded which included date of birth, sex, postcode, age at banding, time in bands, failure to attend (FTA) rate, type of bracket used, reported oral hygiene regimen and number of restored molars. All participants were examined for WSLs on their upper and lower anterior teeth using a visual index outlined by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System II (ICDAS II) and a laser-based caries detection device (DIAGNOdent pen). Of the 91 participants, 50 had saliva properties tested which included hydration, consistency, resting pH, stimulated flow, stimulated pH and buffering capacity. Results Paper 1 : Brushing <b>fewer</b> than 14 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> and the presence of restored molars were significant variables for the development and severity of WSLs when the severity was ≥ ICDAS II grading of 2 (p< 0. 05). When WSLs were ICDAS II ≥ 3 grading, the FTA rate and brushing <b>fewer</b> than 14 <b>times</b> per week were significant variables (p< 0. 05). The number of WSLs increased when participants brushed <b>fewer</b> than 14 <b>times</b> per <b>week</b> or had <b>an</b> increased FTA rate(p< 0. 05). Comparisons between ICDAS II scores and DIAGNOdent pen scores were statistically significant (p< 0. 0001). Results Paper 2 : When using the Saliva-Check Buffer Kit, the pH of stimulated saliva was a significant diagnostic variable in identifying WSLs (p< 0. 05). The pH of stimulated saliva and the quantity of saliva produced in 5 minutes were significant variables of WSL severity when the grading was {{greater than or equal to}} an ICDAS II score of 2 (p< 0. 05). When the grading was greater than or equal to an ICDAS II score of 3, the pH of unstimulated saliva was a significant variable (p< 0. 05). No relationship was found between the number of WSLs in a patient and the saliva properties tested with the Saliva-Check Buffer Kit. Conclusions: A patient’s report of brushings per week indicates the presence, severity and number of white spots they may experience. The number of restored molars may indicate the presence and severity of their white spot lesion experience. Patients who fail to attend appointments are likely to have a larger number of WSLs with greater severity. The DIAGNOdent Pen corresponds significantly to the ICDAS II system to grade WSLs in orthodontic patients. The pH of stimulated saliva, the pH of unstimulated saliva and saliva flow rate may indicate orthodontic patients who are susceptible to WSLs and may also indicate the severity of the lesions. The Saliva-Check Buffer Kit is unable to distinguish between patients who have many or those who have few WSLs. Thesis (D. Clin. Dent.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Dentistry, 201...|$|R
