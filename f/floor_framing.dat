50|$|Because it is {{specifically}} sized to {{be compatible with}} I-joist <b>floor</b> <b>framing,</b> residential builders and building designers like the combination of I-joist and LVL floor and roof assemblies. LVL is a highly reliable building material that provides {{many of the same}} attributes associated with large sized timbers.|$|E
50|$|There is a brick lined, stone flagged storage cellar {{beneath the}} former {{bathroom}} {{on the western}} side of the house. The original half spiral access stair survives, but much of the <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> in this room is reconstructed. The kitchen also retains a stone flagged floor.|$|E

50|$|The main timber <b>floor</b> <b>frame</b> is {{supported}} on sturdy hardwood columns with timber headstocks. Each bearer is jointed over the headstock with a scarfed joint and square timber key.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} wall sections {{are then}} raised {{and put in}} place, temporary braces added and the bottom plates nailed through the subfloor to the <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> members. The braces should have their larger dimension on the vertical and should permit adjustment of the vertical position of the wall.|$|E
50|$|A large brick shed {{dominated}} by a corrugated iron gable roof extends to the south west of the kilns. The ground floor of the shed has a polished concrete germinating floor ventilated by timber shuttered windows. Round cast-iron columns in a grid of 14x6 bays support the timber floor and <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> above.|$|E
50|$|The {{classroom}} interiors {{have high}} level windows, panelled fibro cement walls, fibro cement ceilings and timber floors. <b>Floor</b> <b>framing</b> is supported on large steel I-beams.

50|$|The cube shape {{distinctive}} of the Bahay Kubo {{arises from}} the fact that it is easiest to pre-build the walls and then attach them to the wooden stilt-posts that serve as the corners of the house. The construction of a Bahay Kubo is therefore usually modular, with the wooden stilts established first, a <b>floor</b> <b>frame</b> built next, then wall frames, and finally, the roof.|$|R
30|$|We {{proposed}} {{the use of}} a decoder based on graph augmentation for mitigating trapping sets and thus error floors in LDPC codes. The performance of the proposed decoder was tested through computer simulation on a number of different LDPC codes (both regular and irregular). In all cases, the augmented decoder provided a lower error <b>floor</b> <b>frame</b> error rate than other modified belief propagation decoders presented in the literature.|$|R
50|$|In the {{understorey}} rooms, at {{the eastern}} end of the building, the <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> is visible, revealing that the wall studs are housed or notched into the bearers, requiring the floorboards to be fitted around them. Much of the timber framing and cladding in the barracks building bear the marks of a circular saw. The studs to the internal partition walls bear on the floorboards.|$|E
50|$|Flooring {{throughout}} is {{of timber}} boards supported on a substantial framework of timber beams, joists and posts, {{all of which}} appear {{to be part of}} the 1918-1919 construction. The top floor is largely free of the internal timber posts that are a conspicuous feature of the lower levels. Here, the double-gabled timber roof structure is exposed. Ceilings throughout are unlined, exposing the <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> to the spaces above.|$|E
50|$|The kitchen {{structure}} {{consists of}} a central rectilinear planned core covered by a gable roof. A simple lean-to roof covers the semi-enclosed verandah space to the west. No verandah exists {{to the east of}} the structure; however, remains of <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> indicate that such a structure may once have existed {{on this side of the}} kitchen. A fire place and associated chimney constructed from stone bonded with lime and loam adjoins the northern end of the kitchen.|$|E
50|$|In timber <b>framing</b> {{a single}} <b>floor</b> is a <b>floor</b> <b>framed</b> with single set of joists. A double floor is {{generally}} used for longer spans and joists, called bridging beams or joists, {{are supported by}} other beams called binding beams: the two layers of timbers providing the name double floor. In a double floor there may be two sets of joists, one for the floor above {{and one for the}} ceiling below.|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members can}} be {{assembled}} in various combinations to provide cost-efficient and safe light gauge floor systems for buildings. Such {{light gauge steel}} <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems are widely accepted in industrial and commercial building construction. Light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems must be designed to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. Floor assemblies with higher fire resistance rating are needed to develop resilient building systems for extreme fire events. Recently, a new composite panel system based on external insulation has been developed for light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> to provide higher fire resistance rating under fire conditions. This article presents the details of an experimental investigation of light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> made of both the conventional (with and without cavity insulation) and the new composite panel systems under standard fires. Analysis of the fire test {{results showed that the}} thermal and structural performance of externally insulated light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> system was superior than conventional light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floors</b> with or without cavity insulation. Details of the experimental results including the temperature and deflection profiles measured during the tests are presented along with the joist failure modes. Such fire performance data can be used in the numerical modelling of light gauge steel <b>framing</b> <b>floor</b> systems to further improve the understanding of their fire behaviour and to develop suitable fire design rules...|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} timber framing {{there may}} be a single set of joists which carry both a floor and ceiling called a single floor (single joist <b>floor,</b> single <b>framed</b> <b>floor)</b> or two sets of joists, one carrying the floor and another carrying the ceiling called a double <b>floor</b> (double <b>framed</b> <b>floor).</b> The term binding joist is sometimes used to describe beams at floor level running perpendicular to the ridge of a gable roof and joined to the intermediate posts. Joists which land on a binding joist are called bridging joists. A large beam in the ceiling of a room carrying joists is a summer beam. A ceiling joist may be installed flush with the bottom of the beam or sometimes below the beam. Joists left exposed and visible from below are called [...] "naked flooring" [...] or [...] "articulated" [...] (a modern U.S. term) and were typically planed smooth (wrought) and sometimes chamfered or beaded.|$|R
50|$|The steeply {{pitched roof}} is timber framed and clad in painted {{corrugated}} iron. It has no overhangs {{as the former}} hotel was originally built with verandahs. The front verandahs were replaced by enclosed skillion roofed bays which have recently been demolished. On the western or Wantley Street elevation the <b>floor,</b> <b>framing</b> and stumps of the enclosed bay remains. The rear U-shaped verandah is of relatively recent construction. The low pitched roof of this verandah conceals {{the top of a}} transom light over a rear door.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{building structure}} is structural steel columns encased in masonry, with a structural steel floor frame, infilled with wood floor system joists and decking, and exterior brick masonry walls. The ceiling above the attic is wood framed; and {{the roof is}} framed with steel trusses, wood purlins, and decked with wood. The 1936 addition structure is structural steel columns encased in concrete; and the first, second and third floors are one-way (ribbed) reinforced concrete over structural steel <b>floor</b> <b>framing.</b> The roof is steel frame with mesh reinforced concrete deck.|$|E
50|$|The tower has a {{composite}} structure. The exterior columns and beams are concrete encased steel wide flanges surrounded by reinforcing bars. The composite exterior frame was formed using hydraulic steel forms, or “flying forms,” jacked into {{place with a}} “kangaroo” crane, that was located in the core and manually clamped into place. Wide flange beams topped by a metal deck and concrete form the interior <b>floor</b> <b>framing.</b> The core is A braced steel frame, designed to laterally resist wind loads. The construction of one typical floor was completed every five days.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the augmented decoder {{in the context of}} LDPC codes. The augmented decoder iteratively decodes on a set of graphs with a subset of repeated check nodes; these repetitions serve to alter the dynamics of BP. We apply the augmented decoder to a suite of regular and irregular LDPC codes, demonstrating that it is effective at mitigating error floors due to trapping sets. Furthermore, we show that in terms of error <b>floor</b> <b>frame</b> error rate (FER), the augmented decoder outperforms other methods of trapping set mitigation presented in the literature.|$|R

50|$|The coach house {{complex is}} {{established}} on a <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> system consisting of hardwood stumps, rough sawn hardwood drop log bearers, pit sawn hardwood joists and floor boards. Exterior walls to both buildings are timber framed {{with the dominant}} wall construction for both structures being a system of vertically expressed hardwood posts housed into bed log bearers and extended up to meet a hardwood top plate. Smaller twin sections of timber are fixed to posts to create rebates running {{the length of the}} post. Pit sawn timber slabs are stacked horizontally into these rebates to create the wall membrane.|$|E
50|$|In {{architecture}} and in structural engineering, a joist {{is one of}} a series of horizontal members supporting a ceiling or floor. Joists are supported by foundations, wall framing, or beams. Joists are often laid out in repetitive patterns, much like the ribs of a human body. The intent of the use of this type of framing is to span over an open space below the members. When incorporated into a <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> system, the joists also serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.|$|E
50|$|The former Marcotte Nursing Home {{building}} {{is located on}} the north side of Campus Avenue, just east of the Bates College campus, and across the street from the main medical facilities of Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center. It is a five story masonry structure, built of brick with cast stone trim in the Tudor Revival style. In addition to load-bearing brick walls, it has iron beams for added support. Its stairwells are built with steel framing clad in brick. The interior <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> is wood, and the walls are plaster on lath. There are three (former) principal entrances on the street facade, sheltered by round-arch porticos. The modern d'Youville Pavilion extends to the rear.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, an {{improved}} Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm is proposed. It combines the Differential Evolution algorithm with a quadratic surrogate approximation and a proper infill sampling strategy to choose appropriate sample points. The {{selection of the}} new candidate points is arranged to enhance both the local accuracy and the global optimum search. A comparison between performances of different evolutionary algorithms is carried out by searching the global minimum of two benchmark functions, by solving a dynamic identification problem of a three <b>floor</b> <b>frame</b> and by calibrating the non-linear stress-crack opening relation for Fibre-Reinforced Concrete specimens starting from experimental data...|$|R
50|$|The Old Federal Building is a {{rectangular}} three story limestone Renaissance Revival structure on a raised granite foundation. It measures 64 feet by 103 feet, and is seven bays wide. The first floor is built of smooth coursed limestone with horizontal recessed joints, above {{which is a}} carved frieze. On the main facade, the two upper floors are of plain limestone block, with Ionic columns running the full height of {{the second and third}} <b>floors,</b> <b>framing</b> the central five-bay fenestration. Slightly receding bats are on either side. An ornamental cornice tops the facade, above which is a low tin hipped roof.|$|R
50|$|A {{repetitive}} slip-forming {{process was}} used to construct the tower's core floor by floor. By late April 2011, the tower's steel reinforcement had risen to the 18th floor, while its concrete core had reached the 15th floor, and <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> had been completed up to the fourth floor. By late December 2011, the tower's foundations had been completed, and its steel construction had risen above the 30th floor. By early February 2012, the tower's concrete core had risen to a height of 230 m, with around fifty floors completed. In {{the first months of}} 2012, cracks began appearing in the roads near the tower's construction site. These were blamed on ground subsidence, which was likely caused by excessive groundwater extraction in the Shanghai area, rather than by the weight of the Shanghai Tower.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Norwich's Vibrant Communities Initiative (NVCI) {{noted that}} the {{property}} was vacant. The Carroll Building structure itself is listed as 9-15 Main Street, but directly opposite and owned by the same owner is 16 Main Street. Though {{not included in the}} National Register of Historic Places listing, 16 Main Street was the former site was a Dunkin Donuts shop that has become vacant. NVCI noted that owner of the properties would like to sell and stated total assessed value is $474,000. NVCI reconfirmed the properties iconic nature, but also highlighted structural issues with the roof and <b>floor</b> <b>framing.</b> They also concluded that despite an unusual floorplan, the building would have significant interest for residential units and that the former Dunkin Donuts location could provide 15 parking spaces.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} timber-framed and {{externally}} clad on its exposed faces in chamferboards. All its original timber stumps {{have been replaced}} with concrete ones. While the timber <b>floor</b> <b>framing</b> {{appeared to be in}} good condition, it was noted that a number of steel bearers had been introduced. Painted timber battens screen the gaps between each exterior concrete stump. The building has two gable projections on the front facade. The smaller of the two sits above the verandah, while the other incorporates a triple window. The main roof is short-ridged and slopes continuously {{to the edge of the}} verandah. Where the kitchen abuts the dining room, the main roof is joined to another short-ridged roof sloping at right angles to it. The entire roof is of corrugated galvanized iron with recently installed vents in each ridge.|$|E
50|$|In 1955, {{the first}} {{comfortable}} mass-produced monocoque all-wheel drive vehicle appeared, the M72, with a four-wheel drive system {{adapted from the}} contemporary Soviet GAZ-69. It {{was the brainchild of}} Vitaly Grachev, assistant to the GAZ-69's chief engineer, Grigory Moiseevich Wasserman. It used a standard Pobeda transmission, mated to the GAZ-69 front axle, leaf spring suspension, and transfer case, with a brand-new rear axle (used on no other vehicle, a rarity for Soviet car production). The body had fourteen panels added to strengthen the <b>floor,</b> <b>frame,</b> doors, and roof. Trim and interior were otherwise the same as the M20, and in all, 4,677 were built by end of production in 1958.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{sections}} usually {{include a}} bottom plate which is secured {{to the structure of}} a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel <b>floor</b> <b>frames</b> usually include a rim joist around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping stair stringers.|$|R
5000|$|In construction, a nogging or {{nogging piece}} (England, Australia), dwang (Scotland Central and lower North Island, New Zealand and South Island, New Zealand,), {{blocking}} (North America), noggin (Greater Auckland region North Island, New Zealand), or nogs (New Zealand and Australia [...] ) are horizontal bracing pieces used between wall studs or floor joists to give rigidity {{to the wall}} or <b>floor</b> <b>frames</b> of a building. Noggings may be made of timber, steel, or aluminium. If made of timber they are cut slightly longer than the space they fit into, and are driven into place so they fit tightly or are rebated into the wall stud.|$|R
