500|$|In August 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia {{ordered the}} Nuclear Regulatory Commission to either [...] "approve or reject the Energy Department's {{application}} for [...] never-completed waste storage site at Nevada's Yucca Mountain." [...] The court opinion {{said that the}} NRC was [...] "simply flouting the law" [...] in its previous action to allow the Obama administration to continue plans to close the proposed waste site since a federal law designating Yucca Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository remains in effect. The court opinion stated that [...] "The president may not decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections." [...] In response, NRC issued the final volumes of the Yucca Mountain Safety Evaluation Report (SER), this presented the NRC staff’s statement that the site would meet all applicable standards. At the same time, the staff also stated that NRC should not authorize actual construction of the repository until the requirements for land and water rights were met and a supplement to DOE’s environmental impact statement (EIS) was finished. On March 3, 2015, NRC ordered the staff to complete the supplemental EIS and make the Yucca Mountain licensing <b>document</b> <b>database</b> publicly available, using all the remaining previously appropriated licensing funds.|$|E

The main challenge is to identify and address issues related to designing an effective and efficient speech user interface (SUI), especially if the aim is to facilitate spoken queries of large <b>document</b> <b>databases.</b> Furthermore, the task of presenting large query result sets aurally should be performed such that the user’s short term memory is not overloaded.

40|$|Content-based {{document}} management tasks have gained a prominent {{status in the}} information system field, due to the increased availability of documents. It is very challenging to retrieve Relevant and Related <b>Documents</b> from <b>Document</b> <b>DataBases.</b> The interestingness measures such as Support and Confidence are used to know the relationship and which documents are frequently retrieved, but this leads misleading and not related in some real applications. Hence Cosine is the correlation measure {{used in conjunction with}} support and confidence to get the frequent Document Sets from <b>Document</b> <b>DataBases</b> which generates correlation rules. In this paper, we present Cosine measure applied to <b>Document</b> <b>DataBases.</b> With this correlation measure and pattern interestingness measures, more concise, related, useful and relevant documents are retrieved which even helps to provide ranking for documents...|$|R

50|$|<b>Document</b> <b>databases</b> {{contrast}} {{strongly with}} the traditional relational database (RDB). Relational databases generally store data in separate tables that are defined by the programmer, and a single object may be spread across several tables. <b>Document</b> <b>databases</b> store all information for a given object in a single instance in the database, and every stored object can be different from every other. This makes mapping objects into the database a simple task, normally eliminating anything similar to an object-relational mapping. This makes document stores attractive for programming web applications, which are subject to continual change in place, and where speed of deployment is an important issue.|$|R

50|$|Ranking index method, {{applied to}} <b>document</b> <b>database</b> model, enables Clusterpoint to {{outperform}} SQL databases at search by several orders of magnitude. It solves information overload and latency problem for interactive web and mobile applications processing Big data. Today limited-size mobile device screens and network bandwidth restrictions prevent users requesting and processing large size data volumes per each query. Database search and querying {{need to be}} interactive and transactional to satisfy Internet users. Clusterpoint ranking index was designed for this computing model. It extracts relevant data first and returns information page by page in decreasing relevance. For instance, using only free text search, latency in large databases containing billions of document will be milliseconds, while relevance ranking will prevent overwhelming end-user with too much low-quality search results. This is also a crucial design element for distributed <b>document</b> <b>database</b> architecture: it makes its index scalable {{so that it can}} be safely shared across large cluster of servers without significant performance loss at data injection, free text search and access.|$|E
