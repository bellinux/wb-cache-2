5|$|During the Korean War, USAF {{fighter pilots}} were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, {{designed}} and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, {{as well as}} a novel pilot <b>ejection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Korolev's {{planning}} for the piloted mission began in 1958 with design studies for the future Vostok spacecraft. It was to hold a single passenger in a space suit, and be fully automated. The capsule had an escape mechanism for problems prior to launch, and a soft-landing and <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> during the recovery.|$|E

25|$|The Sparoair I was the {{original}} version of the rocket, launched using an <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> and a lanyard for firing; after that proved unreliable in flight testing, the Sparoair II was developed that utilised a rail launch with ignition prior to release from the aircraft. Eight launches of Sparoair II vehicles had been conducted by 1961. Each Sparoair II rocket cost USD$6,000.|$|E
25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an ejector rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the ejector rod {{has been replaced by}} an automatic <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
25|$|A further {{external}} {{issue that}} affected development was {{the failure of}} the Telecommunications Research Establishment to produce the intended radar bombing system for the aircraft in a timely fashion; this required a redesign in 1947, changing the aircraft's nose to accommodate a glazed tip for visual bombing by a bomb aimer, which in turn required the cockpit to be restructured to facilitate the <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> of the additional crewmember. In 1948, the design team relocated to Warton Aerodrome, Lancashire; establishing a flight test organisation and assembly facilities there.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) using micro-droplet NaCl {{solution is}} described. Since the 1980 s, many liquid micronizing techniques for LIBS measurements have been reported. In this study, micro-droplet <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> for sampling are designed and presented for two volumes. These micro-droplet <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> enable a constant volume of the sample liquid to be obtained and they {{take advantage of the}} liquid physical state; the density of the solution can be controlled accurately. The methods presented here generate small droplets (diameter 30 or 50 μm) by confining the entire volume of the sample material in the laser beam spot area (minimum beam spot diameter: 53. 2 μm) and separating it from its surroundings. Using these liquid micronizing methods, improved sensitivities are obtained for drawing calibration curves for quantitative LIBS measurements...|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} Japanese designs, {{it had a}} very low profile and was {{intended}} to be operated from a squat or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner and open carriage-style legs which could be spread to improve the stability. The breech had a semi-automatic cartridge case <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> to improve reloading time. When the shell was loaded, the rear of the cartridge case tripped a catch closing the breechblock. The recoil action of firing opened the breech and extracted the cartridge case.|$|E
500|$|Saab and BAE {{developed}} the Cobra HMDS {{for use in}} the Gripen, based on the Striker HMDS used on the Eurofighter. By 2008, the Cobra HMDS was fully integrated on operational aircraft, and is available as an option for export customers; it has been retrofitted into older Swedish and South African Gripens. The HMDS provides control and information on target cueing, sensor data, and flight parameters, and is optionally equipped for night time operations and with chemical/biological filtration. [...] All connections between the HMDS and the cockpit were designed for rapid detachment, for safe use of the <b>ejection</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} B-58 {{design was}} the first [...] "true" [...] USAF supersonic bomber program. The Convair design {{was based on a}} delta wing with a leading-edge sweep of 60° with four General Electric J79-GE-1 turbojet engines, capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. Although its large wing made for relatively low wing loading, it proved to be surprisingly well suited for low-altitude, high-speed flight. It seated three (pilot, bombardier/navigator, and defensive systems operator) in separated tandem cockpits. Later versions gave each crew member a novel ejection capsule that made it possible to eject at an altitude of 70,000ft (21,000m) at speeds up to Mach 2 (1,320mph/2,450km/h). Unlike standard ejection seats of the period, a protective clamshell would enclose the seat and the control stick with an attached oxygen cylinder, allowing the pilot to continue to fly even [...] "turtled up" [...] and ready for immediate egress. The capsule would float, and the crewmember could open the clamshell, using it as a life raft. In an unusual test program, live bears and chimpanzees were successfully used to test the <b>ejection</b> <b>system.</b> The XB-70 would use a similar system (though using capsules of a different design).|$|E

25|$|One {{practical}} application {{of its work}} is ensuring and advancing the safety of <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> for pilots.

50|$|Most Landmates {{appear to}} have an <b>ejection</b> <b>system,</b> which allows for the rapid escape of the pilot. When triggered, the Landmate's cockpit hatch blows off and over the left shoulder, {{while the rest of}} the body falls apart in segments, forcing the human inside forward while the {{extremities}} of the machine fall backwards and to the sides. Although it's practically useless while in flight (as the pilot doesn't wear a parachute) the <b>ejection</b> <b>system</b> is useful on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew <b>ejection</b> <b>systems.</b> On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and manufacturing of <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> in injection moulds {{can be a}} complex task, particularly when the parts have long ejection paths. During the injection of tubular- or box shape parts, the shrinkage is constrained by the mould. The mouldings shrink against the core, inserts or pins, thus, during ejection, {{it will be necessary}} to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. Understanding the ejection forces could be a useful contribution to improve <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> designs and guarantee the structural integrity of the mouldings. This information could be even more useful in the processing of thin-walled parts which are more prone to damage during ejection. Frictional forces could be decreased by using specific coatings in the mould core and by optimization of the processing parameters. This study describes the use of DLC and WS 2 coatings and the effect of mould temperature in the ejection forces of tubular mouldings in poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and polystyrene (PS). The studies were based on tubular cup shaped mouldings (60 mm diameter, 60 mm length, 0. 5 mm thickness and 0. 35 º draft angle) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and manufacturing of <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> in the micro injection molding {{process can be}} a complex task, particularly when the parts have several micro holes, {{as in the case}} of multi layer microfluidic devices. During the injection of such parts, the shrinkage is constrained by the mold. Since the moldings shrink against the core, inserts or pins, it is necessary to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage during ejection. Decreasing the ejection forces significantly contributes to improve <b>ejection</b> <b>systems</b> designs and guarantees the structural integrity of the moldings, especially for micro parts, which are more prone to damage during ejection. In this paper, the relationship between the texture characteristics of the micro milled molds and the ejection forces is analyzed. A particular mold geometry was designed and studied for this purpose, and its effectiveness was experimentally evaluated. The relation between the micro milling process parameters, such as the feed per tooth and the depth of cut, and the achieved surface texture characteristics is pointed out providing a direct link between quality of micro milling process and quality of micro injection process that is not easy to find in the specific literature domain. Some preliminary testing that involved the use of an ultra high precision milling machine, a focus variation optical microscope and a micro injection molding system has been used to assess how the finishing quality of the milled mold affects the ejection forces...|$|R
50|$|A more simplistic {{application}} of safety wire, more {{commonly referred to}} as witness wiring, is the use of light gauge, single strand, copper wire to provide positive visual confirmation of the security or closure of specific equipment within the aerospace industry. Common applications include the security of safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, and safety equipment bags, but also as an assurance that critical system switch covers remain in place, such as those associated with the {{application of}} fire suppression, or <b>ejection</b> <b>systems.</b> This application of witness wires is widely varied, and may cover a broad range of types of equipment and numerous situations.|$|R

There are two major mechanisms for initiation of the pyrotechnic powders: heat and shock. Of powders initiated by heat, we have little information on the temperature required for ignition in the normal functioning time (milliseconds) of the device. The known autoignition temperatures obtained from standard tests provide data from days down to minutes with temperatures increasing as heating time decreases. In order to better understand this relationship, and to make computer models, improved data are needed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important technologies for the production of technical plastics parts. An increasing demand of moulds each time more complex and efficient needed exists. Simultaneously the time available for their design and manufacture is shorter, this enhancing the role of the design phase. For the design of the <b>ejection</b> <b>systems,</b> data related to the involved forces is necessary. In order to understand the particularities of the friction phenomena in the interface polymer/mould (steel), it is necessary to understand the replication process. Due to the very different nature of the materials involved (steel and polymers), different optical techniques were used to achieve a qualitative and a quantitative characterization of the surfaces involved...|$|R
