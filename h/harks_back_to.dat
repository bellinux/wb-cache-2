5|$|Manchester's {{buildings}} {{display a}} variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of the architecture of which <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre is {{a large number of}} former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered {{to be one of the}} most important Victorian buildings in England.|$|E
25|$|The {{werewolf}} folklore {{found in}} Europe <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a common development during the Middle Ages, arising {{in the context}} of Christianisation, and the associated interpretation of pre-Christian mythology in Christian terms. Their underlying common origin {{can be traced back to}} Proto-Indo-European mythology, where lycanthropy is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the warrior class. This is reflected in Iron Age Europe in the Tierkrieger depictions from the Germanic sphere, among others. The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).|$|E

After qualifying, Jenson Button {{claimed that the}} track was getting bumpier as the weekend went on, {{particularly}} at Turn 8, which was what caused so many drivers to spin off. This <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> another circuit designed by Hermann Tilke, Shanghai International Circuit, which {{is said to be}} sinking in places because it was built on the site of a former swamp. Jarno Trulli was notable for his lukewarm feeling towards the circuit, saying that he felt the circuit was easy to learn, and that good performance was down more to the car than the driver.|$|E

500|$|The Four Pieces of 1887 {{are perhaps}} Rachmaninoff's first {{comprehensive}} works. Each {{has a clear}} aim and method to attain it, and all unfold with a fluency significantly more advanced than that shown in the previous nocturnes. The opening Romance, in F-sharp minor, <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Frédéric Chopin's tenderness. The E-flat minor Prelude is an unremarkable but well-thought out piece. The third, a Mélodie in E major, is modestly expressive, but the Gavotte in D major is, although repetitive, the most energetic and vigorous piece. These were published posthumously in Moscow in 1948, without an opus number.|$|E
500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{was impressed with}} the song, calling it one of the album's more upbeat tracks, which [...] "blooms into another epic soundscape led by [...] vocals and some brilliantly used electronic elements". She felt that the fans' vocal contribution to the song <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> previous album This Is War without sounding [...] "cliché or overdone". Sarah O' Hara from Lowdown also responded positively to the track, writing that [...] "glorious chants fuel the uplifting 'Do or Die'". In a mixed review, John Watt from Drowned in Sound called the song [...] "half-baked synth-rock." [...] Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A and wrote that [...] "the band soars as whole on this tune", calling Leto's vocals [...] "raw, powerful and captivating." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{press release}} for the single and its {{accompanying}} remixes, Carey said the following regarding the re-recorded vocals: [...] "I’ve always {{had so much fun}} re-singing my songs for the club/dance mixes. It gives me the freedom to sing as powerfully as I want and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was more of what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Alison Rowat of The Herald {{felt that}} the current storylines {{indicated}} [...] "the best days of EE are over", commenting: [...] "Contrast it with the ever sprightly Coronation Street, where the scenes featuring Gail “Black Widow” McIntyre and her lucky white heather husband have been perfect soap fare. What does EastEnders have? Another murder investigation {{in a place that}} has a higher homicide rate than The Wire Baltimore. Andrew Billen of The Times refuted claims by the BBC that [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was not a [...] "gimmick" [...] but in fact proof of the soap's [...] "innovative vigour". Billen deemed the live episode a [...] "reactionary move", observing that Coronation Street had aired a live episode for its 40th anniversary in 2000. He reminded readers: [...] "live television drama is nothing new but rather <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the earliest days of television and, beyond them, to theatre itself."

500|$|Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also commended [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] and its musical style, saying [...] "The song is {{infused with}} the tropical, island groove {{that she has}} {{explored}} on 'Loud' and which <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her upbringing in Barbados." [...] Sciarretto also noted that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] would be very popular in bars and clubs because of the lyrical content. Andy Gill of The Independent called the song an anthem with which the weekend can start. Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is the best song on the album, saying [...] " [...] a wise, world-weary paean from a gal at the bar who's seen some stuff, has moved on and wants to buy everybody a round of fruity shots." [...] However, Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] did not meet his expectations and commented that the song is a lowlight in Rihanna's career, stating [...] "'Turn it around with another round,' Rihanna bellows over the mid slog, as if setting ad copy to music." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "In {{addition}} to raising the Madonna/whore ante with songs like the title cut, Virgin cradled {{the kind of}} '80s hits ("Dress You Up") built to transcend the Dynasty era." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine remembered {{the first time that}} he heard the songs from the album and commented, [...] "Lots of critics think something similar occurred when Madonna followed her eponymous debut with Like a Virgin, helmed by Nile Rodgers with all the fixin's—too calculated next to the 'raw passion' of the debut. This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: [...] "With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view is decidedly more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value. The words 'shiny and new' describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song but the sound of the album." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} of other artists, {{performance}} artist Ben Wagin founded the Parliament of Trees in the former death strip {{on the east side}} of the Spree River, opposite the Reichstag. 258 names of victims of the Wall are listed on granite slabs. Some listed as [...] "unknown man" [...] or [...] "unknown woman" [...] are merely identified with a date of death. The collection, which was created in 1990, contains people who were later not considered to be victims of the Wall. Black and white painted segments of the Wall stand in the background. The memorial needed to be minimized for the construction of the Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus. In 2005, a further memorial was opened in the basement of the Bundestag building. They used wall segments of the former Parliament of Trees. In 1998, the Republic of Germany and the state of Berlin established the Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Straße and declared it as a national memorial. The memorial <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a draft drawn up by the architects Kohlhoff & Kohlhoff. Later, it was extended and today it includes the Berlin Wall Documentation Center, a visiting center, the Chapel of Reconciliation, the Window of Remembrance with portraits of those who lost their lives on the grounds of the Berlin Wall, and a 60-meter-long section of the former border installations which is enclosed by steel walls at both ends.|$|E
500|$|... "Rocket" [...] is a {{six and a}} half-minute track, {{the longest}} one on Beyoncé. It runs in a slow tempo and explores {{elements}} of soul music, neo soul, funk and R balladry. It was noted {{to be one of}} the album's retro songs. Houston Chronicle Joey Guerra deemed the track an [...] "old-school R stunner" [...] filled with [...] "all swooping verses and steamy choruses". Many critics found similarities to work by musician Prince. Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly described the track as a [...] "funk excursion" [...] similar to songs by Prince. Mike Divers from Clash magazine also felt that [...] "Rocket" [...] was reminiscent of Prince's [...] "funky prime". Jon Pareles of The New York Times noted that the seductive track <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Prince's music with [...] "harmonies blossom all around Beyoncé's cooing lead vocal". Julia Leconte of Now summarized the song's sound as a cross between music by D'Angelo during the late-90s and Usher during the early 2000s. Other critics noted [...] "Rocket" [...] to be a rehash and a homage of D'Angelo's work, particularly on his song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)". Claire Lobenfeld of Complex magazine found cues taken from [...] "Untitled" [...] in [...] "Rocket" [...] to the [...] "point of pop-facsimile". Variety Andrew Barker deemed the seductive, [...] "grinding" [...] "Rocket" [...] a 2013 makeover of that song. In a review for The Quietus, Mof Gimmers concluded that the song followed up where Ciara's [...] "Body Party" [...] (2013) and R. Kelly's Black Panties (2013) finished.|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of your bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if you are looking for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but seem to work with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E

[...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film {{four and a half}} stars out of five, saying [...] "Brad Bird's Ratatouille is so audacious you have {{to fall in love with}} its unlikely hero." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Ratatouille is delicious fun sure to be savored by audiences of all ages for its sumptuous visuals, clever wit and irresistibly inspiring tale."

500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that <b>harks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
