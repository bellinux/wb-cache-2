5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing <b>dopamine</b> {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are <b>dopamine</b> transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit <b>dopamine</b> reuptake, resulting in increased <b>dopamine</b> concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of <b>dopamine</b> in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of <b>dopamine,</b> with no indication of its function; however, <b>dopamine</b> has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of <b>dopamine</b> as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. <b>Dopamine</b> functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> {{itself is}} used as {{precursor}} in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine. <b>Dopamine</b> is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme <b>dopamine</b> β-hydroxylase, with O2 and L-ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the cofactor.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, <b>dopamine</b> {{functions}} as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, <b>dopamine</b> is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. <b>Dopamine</b> is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of <b>dopamine</b> occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for <b>dopamine,</b> trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate <b>dopamine</b> signaling by inducing <b>dopamine</b> reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Like most amines, <b>dopamine</b> is {{an organic}} base. As a base, it is {{generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, <b>dopamine</b> is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, <b>dopamine</b> is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as <b>dopamine</b> hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when <b>dopamine</b> is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, <b>dopamine</b> hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have <b>dopamine</b> neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. <b>Dopamine</b> is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. <b>Dopamine</b> produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} <b>dopamine,</b> secrete prolactin continuously; <b>dopamine</b> inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, <b>dopamine</b> is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced <b>dopamine</b> production in the brain's basal ganglia. <b>Dopamine</b> does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of <b>dopamine.</b> However a precursor of <b>dopamine,</b> levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to <b>dopamine,</b> and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in <b>dopamine</b> synthesis and <b>dopamine</b> receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of <b>dopamine</b> with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in <b>dopamine</b> levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> {{has also}} {{consistently}} {{been shown to}} play a role in reward learning, in all animal groups. As in all vertebrates – invertebrates such as roundworms, flatworms, molluscs and common fruit flies can all be trained to repeat an action if it is consistently followed by an increase in <b>dopamine</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity {{can be caused}} by medication, particularly orally active <b>dopamine</b> agonists. The <b>dopamine</b> dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|In {{a species}} of marine green algae Ulvaria obscura, a major {{component}} of some algal blooms, <b>dopamine</b> is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. There is evidence that this <b>dopamine</b> functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, <b>dopamine</b> plays {{important}} roles in executive functions, motor control, motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward, as well as lower-level functions including lactation, sexual gratification, and nausea. The dopaminergic cell groups and pathways make up the <b>dopamine</b> system which is neuromodulatory.|$|E
5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to <b>dopamine,</b> and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of <b>dopamine</b> via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not <b>dopamine.</b> However, there is substantial evidence that the neuromelanin that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to <b>dopamine</b> agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} <b>dopamine</b> on the lactrotrope cells, usually {{bromocriptine}} or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make supplementary treatment unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Research {{motivated}} by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels {{led to the}} discovery in 2007 that {{a wide variety of}} materials, if placed in a solution of <b>dopamine</b> at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of polymerized <b>dopamine,</b> often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized <b>dopamine</b> forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Synthesis usually involves reaction of <b>dopamine</b> hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. <b>Dopamine</b> and serotonin were collected using microdialysis, and increases in <b>dopamine</b> and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in <b>dopamine</b> concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in <b>dopamine,</b> and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in <b>dopamine.</b> Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in <b>dopamine,</b> peaking at 40 minutes, with an insignificant increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for <b>dopamine</b> (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. <b>dopamine).</b> Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>dopamine</b> {{agonists}} {{that bind}} to <b>dopamine</b> receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. <b>Dopamine</b> agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>dopamine</b> {{transporter}} {{contains a}} high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits <b>dopamine</b> reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced <b>dopamine</b> efflux in vitro. binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396).... Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.}} The human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter {{do not contain}} zinc binding sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain <b>dopamine</b> receptors, and that <b>dopamine</b> acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their <b>dopamine</b> input is not clearly established—it may come from <b>dopamine</b> that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|Though <b>dopamine</b> {{agonists}} {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to <b>dopamine</b> agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus <b>dopamine</b> agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Administration of alprazolam, as {{compared}} to lorazepam, has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular <b>dopamine</b> D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>dopamine</b> is {{normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of <b>dopamine</b> can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} <b>dopamine</b> agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two <b>dopamine</b> agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> (DA, a {{contraction}} of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays several {{important roles in}} the brain and body. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized {{in the brain and}} kidneys. <b>Dopamine</b> is also synthesized in plants and most animals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of <b>dopamine</b> have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dopamine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named <b>dopamine</b> {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that <b>dopamine</b> is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that <b>dopamine</b> neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive <b>dopamine</b> neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. <b>Dopamine</b> neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and <b>dopamine</b> release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on <b>dopamine</b> release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that <b>dopamine</b> may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of <b>dopamine</b> varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to <b>dopamine</b> neurons, which is characterized by <b>dopamine</b> terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of <b>dopamine.</b> Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of <b>dopamine</b> in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down <b>dopamine.</b> Like <b>dopamine</b> agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize <b>dopamine</b> to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas—the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains <b>dopamine</b> at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain <b>dopamine</b> at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The <b>dopamine</b> in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 <b>dopamine</b> receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} <b>dopamine</b> agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to <b>dopamine</b> elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to <b>dopamine</b> outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter <b>dopamine</b> in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective <b>dopamine</b> receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like <b>dopamine</b> receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the <b>dopamine</b> D2 receptors.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cofactors {{also require}} their own synthesis. Deficiency in any {{required}} amino acid or cofactor can impair {{the synthesis of}} <b>dopamine,</b> norepinephrine, and epinephrine.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of <b>dopamine,</b> L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although <b>dopamine</b> {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no reports}} of <b>dopamine</b> in archaea, {{but it has been}} {{detected}} in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize <b>dopamine.</b> It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that may have occurred relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps {{as a result of the}} symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E
