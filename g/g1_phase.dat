5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A, whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E

Tamoxifen causes cells {{to remain in the}} G0 and <b>G1</b> <b>phases</b> of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal.|$|R
50|$|Recent work {{exploring}} p21 activation {{in response}} to DNA damage at a single-cell level have demonstrated that pulsatile p53 activity leads to subsequent pulses of p21, and that the strength of p21 activation is cell cycle phase dependent. Moreover, studies of p21-levels in populations of cycling cells, not exposed to DNA damaging agents, have shown that DNA damage occurring in mother cell S-phase can induce p21 accumulation over both mother G2 and daughter <b>G1</b> <b>phases</b> which subsequently induces cell cycle arrest; this responsible for the bifurcation in CDK2 activity observed in Spencer et al..|$|R
5000|$|In {{isolated}} cases, tamoxifen {{was effective}} in PDP treatment, especially for bone and joint pain. In PDP patients, high levels of nuclear receptors were found for steroids, which was the rationale to use tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist. Tamoxifen and several of its metabolites competitively bind to estrogen receptors on tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis. Cells are [...] in G0 and <b>G1</b> <b>phases.</b> In vitro studies showed that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and inhibits the resorbing activity of osteoclasts (disruption of bone tissue).|$|R

25|$|The cip/kip family {{includes}} the genes p21, p27 and p57. They halt cell cycle in <b>G1</b> <b>phase,</b> by binding to, and inactivating, cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by p53 (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor of β (TGF β), a growth inhibitor.|$|E

25|$|The Amon lab {{primarily}} investigates yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a {{model for}} understanding the controls that govern cell-cycle progression. As a Whitehead Fellow, her team discovered that CDC20 plays a crucial role in cell division. Her Whitehead team identified an interaction between phosphatase and CDC14 which initiates the exit of cells from mitosis to the <b>G1</b> <b>phase.</b> Amon's team demonstrated that CDC20 is the target protein in the spindle checkpoint during mitosis.|$|E
25|$|Association of {{the origin}} {{recognition}} complex (ORC) with a replication origin is required to recruit both cell division cycle 6 protein (Cdc6) and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 protein (Cdt1), which initiate the assembly of the pre-RC. Both Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins associate with the already bound ORC independently from each other. The ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 together are required for the stable association of the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm 2-7) complex proteins with replicative origins during <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> of the cell cycle.|$|E

50|$|It is {{necessary}} to inactivate the cyclin B-Cdk1 complex in order to exit the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. The cells can {{then return to the}} first gap <b>phase</b> <b>G1</b> and wait until the cycle proceeds yet again.|$|R
5000|$|The protein Src {{tyrosine}} kinase is overexpressed in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells compared with control B cells. [...] Inhibition of Src arrests the cell cycle at <b>phase</b> <b>G1</b> and has {{little effect on}} the survival of WM or normal cells.|$|R
25|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{consists}} of four distinct phases: <b>G1</b> <b>phase,</b> S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase {{is dependent on the}} proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called G0 phase.|$|E
25|$|In <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> of {{the cell}} cycle, many of the DNA {{replication}} regulatory processes are initiated. In eukaryotes, {{the vast majority of}} DNA synthesis occurs during S phase {{of the cell}} cycle, and the entire genome must be unwound and duplicated to form two daughter copies. During G2, any damaged DNA or replication errors are corrected. Finally, one copy of the genomes is segregated to each daughter cell at mitosis or M phase. These daughter copies each contain one strand from the parental duplex DNA and one nascent antiparallel strand.|$|E
25|$|The cells {{which are}} {{actively}} undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is {{made use of}} in cancer treatment; by {{a process known as}} debulking, a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.|$|E
40|$|At the <b>G(1)</b> /S <b>phase</b> {{cell cycle}} transition, {{multiple}} histone genes are expressed {{to ensure that}} newly synthesized DNA is immediately packaged as chromatin. Here we have purified and functionally characterized the critical transcription factor HiNF-P, which is required for E 2 F-independent activation of the histone H 4 multigene family. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and ligation-mediated PCR-assisted genomic sequencing, we show that HiNF-P interacts with conserved H 4 cell cycle regulatory sequences in vivo. Antisense inhibition of HiNF-P reduces endogenous histone H 4 gene expression. Furthermore, we find that HiNF-P utilizes NPAT/p 220, a substrate of the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK 2) kinase complex, as a key coactivator to enhance histone H 4 gene transcription. The biological role of HiNF-P is reflected by impeded cell cycle progression into S phase upon antisense-mediated reduction of HiNF-P levels. Our results establish that HiNF-P is the ultimate link in a linear signaling pathway that is initiated with the growth factor-dependent induction of cyclin E/CDK 2 kinase activity at the restriction point and culminates in the activation of histone H 4 genes through HiNF-P at the <b>G(1)</b> /S <b>phase</b> transition...|$|R
50|$|Both p53-dependent and p53-independent {{cell cycle}} arrest are not {{specific}} to G2; these same proteins function upstream in DNA damage checkpoints in <b>G1</b> and S <b>phase</b> as well. In yeast, {{which has no}} p53 homolog, G2 arrest functions through the p53-independent pathway.|$|R
50|$|During this transition, G1 cyclin D-Cdk4/6 dimer phosphorylates {{retinoblastoma}} releasing {{transcription factor}} E2F, which then drives {{the transition from}} <b>G1</b> to S <b>phase.</b> The G1/S transition is highly regulated by transcription factor p53 in order to halt the cell cycle when DNA is damaged.|$|R
25|$|Active S cyclin-CDK {{complexes}} phosphorylate {{proteins that}} make up the pre-replication complexes assembled during <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> on DNA replication origins. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's genome will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to gene copy number effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|TIGAR {{activity}} can prevent cells progressing into S phase through a checkpoint known in humans as the restriction point. At {{the very start}} of <b>G1</b> <b>phase,</b> a protein called retinoblastoma (Rb) exists in an un-phosphorylated state. In this state, Rb binds to a protein transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F from activating transcription of proteins essential for S-phase. During a normal cell cycle, as G1 progresses, Rb will become phosphorylated in {{a specific set of}} sequential steps by proteins called cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) bound to cyclin proteins. The specific complexes that phosphorylate Rb are cyclin D-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> of {{the cell}} cycle there are low levels of CDK {{activity}}. This low level of CDK activity allows {{for the formation of}} new pre-RC complexes but is not sufficient for DNA replication to be initiated by the newly formed pre-RCs. During the remaining phases {{of the cell}} cycle there are elevated levels of CDK activity. This high level of CDK activity is responsible for initiating DNA replication as well as inhibiting new pre-RC complex formation. Once DNA replication has been initiated the pre-RC complex is broken down. Due to the fact that CDK levels remain high during the S phase, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle no new pre-RC complexes can be formed. This all helps to ensure that no initiation can occur until the cell division is complete.|$|E

Release {{of the cells}} from IFN-gamma-mediated growth inhibition led to a rapid and significant increase in DNA synthesis, followed by doubling of cell numbers. The DNA synthesis profile was strikingly similar to that shown by WISH cells released from growth arrest by the <b>G(1)</b> /S <b>phase</b> inhibitor, aphidicolin, This strongly suggested that IFN-gamma treatment leads to growth inhibition of WISH cells at the G(1) /S boundary of the cell cycle.

500|$|Double-strand breaks can be {{repaired}} through homologous recombination or through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). [...] NHEJ is a DNA repair mechanism which, unlike homologous recombination, {{does not require}} a long homologous sequence to guide repair. [...] Whether homologous recombination or NHEJ is used to repair double-strand breaks is largely determined by the phase of cell cycle. [...] Homologous recombination repairs DNA before the cell enters mitosis (M phase). [...] It occurs during and shortly after DNA replication, in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are more easily available. Compared to homologous chromosomes, which are similar to another chromosome but often have different alleles, sister chromatids are an ideal template for homologous recombination because they are an identical copy of a given chromosome. [...] In contrast to homologous recombination, NHEJ is predominant in the <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> of the cell cycle, when the cell is growing but not yet ready to divide. [...] It occurs less frequently after the <b>G1</b> <b>phase,</b> but maintains at least some activity throughout the cell cycle. [...] The mechanisms that regulate homologous recombination and NHEJ throughout the cell cycle vary widely between species.|$|E
500|$|Tremella mesenterica has a yeastlike {{phase in}} its life cycle that arises {{as a result}} of budding of basidiospores. The {{alternation}} between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast-form haploid cells of two compatible mating types. Each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of the target cell having the opposite mating type to the pheromone-producing cell. The sexual differentiation is characterized by the arrest of the growth in the <b>G1</b> <b>phase</b> of the cell division cycle and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube. Formation of the mating tube, initiated by the pheromones A-10 and a-13, is similar to the process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts. Tremerogen A-10 has been purified and its chemical structure found to be S-polyisoprenyl peptide.

50|$|The G1/S {{cell cycle}} {{checkpoint}} controls {{the passage of}} eukaryotic cells from the first gap <b>phase,</b> <b>G1,</b> into the DNA synthesis phase, S. In this switch in mammalian cells, there are two cell cycle kinases that help to control the checkpoint: cell cycle kinases CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E. The transcription complex that includes Rb and E2F is important in controlling this checkpoint. In the first gap phase, the Rb-HDAC repressor complex binds to the E2F-DP1 transcription factors, therefore inhibiting the downstream transcription. The phosphorylation of Rb by CDK4/6 and CDK2 dissociates the Rb-repressor complex and serves as an on/off switch for the cell cycle. Once Rb is phosphorylated, the inhibition is released on the E2F transcriptional activity. This allows for the transcription of S phase genes encoding for proteins that amplify the <b>G1</b> to S <b>phase</b> switch.|$|R
