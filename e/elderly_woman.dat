40|$|ABSTRACT: Elderly {{problem is}} a major problem across the world, as the elderly {{population}} is growing due to increase in health facilities. Among the <b>elderly</b> people, <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> are most vulnerable group of the society suffering from socio-economic and health problems. The extents of problems of <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> are more if they are widows. The paper analyzed the statistics of the elderly population and discussed the problems faced by <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in India. It is found that there is no particular social welfare scheme available for the betterment of health problems of the <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> Hence, the paper concluded with the remarks that there is need for health scheme for the <b>elderly</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R

40|$|Japan and Korea {{are close}} neighbors geographically, and have similar cultures, but are quite {{different}} socio-economically. There have been few comparative studies of the two countries. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare daily living physical activity (DLPA) and its components over a wide age range between Japanese and Korean <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> The subjects were 430 (176 Japanese and 254 Korean) <b>elderly</b> <b>women,</b> aged 65 to 84 years. Seventeen items related to DLPA were measured. The Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficients between the performance test scores and age were significant (P< 0. 05) for 17 items in Korean elderly wpmen and for 16 items (trunk flexion was not significant) in Japanese <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> The scores for 16 items in Korean <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> and 15 items in Japanese <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> were decreased markedly with aging, while changes in one item (Korea: foot-tapping in a sitting position) and two items (Japan: trunk flexion, sit & reach) were not significant. To identify potential dimensions of overall DLPA, principal component analysis was applied to a 17 × 17 correlation matrix. The first principal component was interpreted as fundamental DLPA. The results of the comparison clearly indicated that Korean <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> had a lower fundamental DLPA level than Japanese <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in the 70 - 84 age group (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, to obtain a simple factor structure that would explain a large percentage of the total variance for these <b>elderly</b> <b>women,</b> extracted factors were rotated with a normal varimax criterion. DLPA was found to consist of 7 factors: locomotion (F 1), agility (F 2), flexibility (F 3), balance (F 4), muscle strength (F 5), reaction time (F 6) and leg endurance (F 7). The results of comparison of the 7 factors between Japanese and Korean <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> showed that Japanese <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> performed significantly better on F 1, F 2, F 4, F 6 and F 7 values, but were not different on F 3 and F 5. From these results, it can be concluded that advancing age significantly effects performance for all items in <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> of both countries, and that the higher DLPA level reflects a lifestyle of more vigorous physical activity in Japanese <b>elderly</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract = Objectives: This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the factors affecting the depression of the <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in poverty in community. Methods: The subjects were 1, 208 <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> over 65 years who were enrolled in the Public Health Care Center from Apr. 2008 to Jun. 2008. Data were collected using questionnaires including general characteristics, health related behaviors and health status by nurses at the time of enrollment. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, χ 2 -test, Pearson correlation coefficients and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The major findings of this study are as follows: The <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in poverty show a tendency to have lower level in income, education, self-rated health, cognitive function compared with ordinary women in old age. The predictors of depression of the <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in poverty were spouse's existence or nonexistence, type of insurance, cognitive function, and self-rated health. Conclusion: These findings suggest the need to develop nursing strategies for decreasing depression in the <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> in poverty.

The {{disasters}} in Indonesia have destructed infra and supra structure that evoked more problems in human life, in example, the problems faced by <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> Not feasible residence, poor health service, and not guaranteed well-being are the examples of negative effect of disaster for <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> Therefore, <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> face a dilemmatic situation that disrupts their life. Related to this poor condition post of earthquake in 2009, some tarekhat ulamas in West Sumatera performed a protection act through sumbayang 40 (40 praying). By means of this religious tradition, the <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> who were disrupted by the earthquake gain protections from this activity such as religious education, economic support, psychological recovery, and settlement protection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between fear of falling and the arm movements in the <b>elderly</b> <b>women.</b> The subjects consisted of 48 <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> (mean age, 74. 8 ± 7. 1 years) and 10 young women (20. 9 ± 0. 3 years). Fear of falling and experiences of falls in the previous year were investigated, and forward, lateral, and downward arm movement times in the standing position were measured. The arm movement time was compared with the degrees of fear of falling, as well as with the presence and absence of experiences of falls.

40|$|Little {{research}} {{attention has}} been given to examining inequalities in the health of <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> and men, in spite of their high use of health services and the importance of health to maintaining independence in later life. This paper uses data from the British General Household Survey to analyse the variation in health of <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> and men by class and material circumstances. Two measures of health are used; self-assessed health and functional disability. <b>Elderly</b> <b>women</b> assess their own health less positively than men, and are seriously disadvantaged compared to men in terms of functional disability. Class based on the individual's own previous main occupation is strongly associated with the two measures of health for <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> and men at all ages. For <b>elderly</b> <b>women,</b> an 'individualistic' approach, using the women's own last occupation, is compared with the 'conventional' approach of measuring class, which for married women uses their husband's last occupation and for other women their own last occupation. Using the two approaches makes little difference to the strength of association between class and health. <b>Elderly</b> <b>women</b> and men who live in advantaged material circumstances, in terms of income, car ownership and housing tenure, report significantly better health, after controlling for age and class. Level of functional disability is influenced by previous position in the labour market but not current material circumstances. Although <b>elderly</b> <b>women</b> suffer greater morbidity than elderly men, structural inequalities in health are equally pronounced for women and men in later life. gender inequalities elderly people...|$|R
