25|$|In an {{epilogue}} to Foundation's Triumph, Brin noted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> {{himself or}} a different author writing another sequel {{to add to}} Foundation's Triumph, feeling that Hari Seldon's story was not yet necessarily finished. He later published a possible start of such a book on his website.|$|E
25|$|In another short, Little Beau Pepé, Pepé, {{attempting}} {{to find the}} most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and colognes upon himself. This resulted in something close to a love-potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pepé in an explosion of hearts. Pepé is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women ("But Madame!"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b>|$|E
500|$|Whilst the storyline aired, Richardson and Slanina-Davies fronted {{a charity}} {{campaign}} called [...] "Expect Respect" [...] {{in order to}} combat domestic violence. At the time Richardson released a statement opining domestic violence affects many young people in any form of life. He stated <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> [...] "how frightening {{it would be to}} have him as a boyfriend" [...] and condemned his [...] "violence and bullying" [...] because it is always unacceptable." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> his {{telling her}} except as an {{incredibly}} shattering act.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> that <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> so outlandish a {{cause for}} his wife's not getting on with him was {{certainly}} no Forsyte.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{knew that}} they were {{speaking}} of him, but what it all meant <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "Our Town" [...] {{was written}} by future {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Rob Bowman. The episode was Spotnitz's first stand-alone episode for the show. He had wanted to do an episode about cannibalism occurring at a chicken processing plant, thinking {{it was one of}} the most despicable and vile things <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine.</b> Spotnitz was inspired by the Spencer Tracy movie Bad Day at Black Rock, which is about a town holding a terrible secret. He was also inspired by an article he read at UCLA about salamanders getting sick from eating other salamanders; Spotnitz's brother later suggested him to include the theme in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Bannister {{pronounced}} Hendrix dead, {{a hospital}} spokesperson told the press: [...] "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but {{he died of}} an overdose." [...] By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: [...] "Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." [...] At 2 p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: [...] "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions {{as one of the}} most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." [...] That evening, The New York Times described him as [...] "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> and create." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{why they}} both burst into laughter, Hayward uproariously, and Weeks with a funny chuckle.|$|R
60|$|What {{would happen}} {{at the end of}} the spell? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not tell. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> the {{thoughts}} of these men. He was sensible only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy. Vague possibilities of shame and violence chased one another across his mind. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> devise some weapon? He recalled his assault upon the hypnotist, but there were no detachable lamps here. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see nothing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch up in his defence.|$|R
60|$|Then came a {{recollection}} of the cowardly attack. But what had followed was a blank, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> where <b>he</b> was.|$|R
2500|$|The Supreme Court {{overturned}} the trial. [...] Justice Taschereau wrote an opinion saying <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> {{that there was}} sufficient evidence to convict Dr. Azoulay. [...] However, he agreed with the dissenting Chief Justice in the lower court that the trial judge [...] "failed to instruct properly the jury, in omitting to review the evidence." [...] Taschereau pointed to Spencer v. Alaska Parkers (1905) to say precedent had been established that judges should help guide the jury in giving [...] "value and effect" [...] to certain pieces of evidence. [...] Thus, needless details were not discarded, and the jury was [...] "left {{in a state of}} confusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} written for and {{recorded}} with Gainsbourg's girlfriend, Brigitte Bardot, in late 1967. Bardot asked him to write the most beautiful love song <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> and that night he wrote [...] "Je t'aime" [...] and [...] "Bonnie and Clyde". They recorded an arrangement of [...] "Je t'aime" [...] by Michel Colombier at a Paris studio in a two-hour session in a small glass booth; the engineer William Flageollet said there was [...] "heavy petting". However, news of the recording reached the press and Bardot's husband, German businessman Gunter Sachs, was angry and called for the single to be withdrawn. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release it. [...] He complied but observed [...] "The music is very pure. For {{the first time in}} my life, I write a love song and it's taken badly." ...|$|E
60|$|Prescott {{knew little}} about England, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> her making an {{undesirable}} sensation in Montreal or Toronto.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Robin Williams guest starred as the episode's villain Merritt Rook. Executive {{producer}} Neal Baer said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{anyone else}} playing the role.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{could not}} take it in all at once. He was stunned. All <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{understand}} was that a far worse thing had happened than anything <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>imagined.</b>|$|R
60|$|Prescott {{felt embarrassed}} and guilty, as he {{generally}} did when, in confidential moments, {{she called him}} by Jernyngham's name. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> her saying Jack.|$|R
60|$|Andrew was moved. Loving {{adventure}} as he did, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> what Graham's self-denial {{had cost}} {{him while he}} had cheerfully carried out his duty to his family.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked up}} at him from where she sat as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> her looking up at the curate at Bognor. [...] "Thank you, sir! If that's all you want----!" ...|$|E
60|$|Prescott laughed. Remembering how Jernyngham {{had driven}} a truculent rabble out of Sebastian, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> {{the scene in}} the shed; but it was evident that the boiler-makers bore him no malice.|$|E
60|$|He {{hardly knew}} what to say or how to act. His {{reception}} had not been what he had anticipated, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> what was coming next.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> {{how long}} he had been under the fallen dirt, but knew it must be some time, perhaps an hour or two. Where Barringford was there was no telling.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> have <b>imagined</b> <b>he</b> heard a {{voice calling}} upon {{him to come out}} into life, to escape from the body of this death. But it was his own voice that called to him....|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you feel}} that you have within you {{something}} that is akin to this storm?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> her leaning forward as she uttered the words. [...] "Passion makes one the equal of the elements." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was time}} he arrived, even supposing he {{remained}} over night at his home, {{as had been}} intimated, {{and the only reason}} for delay which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> was that the young gentleman's parents refused to let him continue the hunting trip.|$|E
60|$|Her voice trembled a little, {{though her}} eyes were hard, and Prescott felt sorry for her. She was not of {{emotional}} nature; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> her shrinking from any display of tenderness. Nevertheless, {{it was obvious that}} she was a prey to fear and grief.|$|E
5000|$|... "He (Demetriou) said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> an AFL {{competition}} without Port Adelaide in it. I {{thought that}} was a really strong statement of leadership.” Keith Thomas at a press conference upon the retirement of Andrew Demetriou.|$|R
60|$|So {{still he}} {{remained}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be <b>imagined</b> {{to have left}} in him no motive power whatever. The clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion in none.|$|R
60|$|The words {{seemed to}} stick funnily in his throat, but {{he asked them}} nevertheless. He liked Miss Wilkinson very much now, and was thrilled by her conversation, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> anyone making love to her.|$|R
60|$|A {{tremendous}} {{desire for}} eloquence arose in Mr. Direck's soul, a desire so tremendous that no conceivable phrase <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> satisfied it. So he remained tongue-tied. And Cecily was tongue-tied, too. The {{scent of the}} roses just tinted the clear sweetness of the air they breathed.|$|E
6000|$|Peter {{looked all}} around, this way, that way, every way, with the funniest {{expression}} on his face. He didn't see anything of Mrs. Phoebe and he didn't see any place in which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> Mr. and Mrs. Phoebe building a nest. [...] "What are you looking for?" [...] asked Dear Me.|$|E
60|$|Ellen saw Bruce shrink {{in fear of}} his life; {{and despite}} her fury she was filled with disgust that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>imagine</b> she would have his blood on her hands. Then she divined that Bruce saw more in the {{gathering}} storm in her father's eyes than he had to fear from her.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982 Fixx {{published}} Jackpot!, {{the story}} of what happened after the publication of The Complete Book of Running when he experienced the [...] "Great American Fame Machine", becoming richer and more celebrated than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>imagined.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lieutenant Clinton Lear, the post's quartermaster, {{even went}} so far as to assert that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>imagine</b> [...] "that God ever {{intended}} white man to occupy such a barren waste" [...] as was found at Phantom Hill.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shut your eyes, then,' {{said the}} stone; and he shut them, {{and when he}} opened them again there was the palace, more {{beautiful}} than anything <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>imagined,</b> the fires throwing a soft pink glow over the ice.|$|R
