60|$|His pipe was now alight. He drank {{his beer}} all at once, and he smoked and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> half {{proud of}} his speech. Then he swung into {{the seat of the}} machine, having {{attended}} to the horses' heads. He lifted the knife.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> peculiarly, [...] "—it {{seems to}} take the shine off things," [...] he added, and then, smiling again with ugly irony—"She's our {{skeleton}} in the closet." [...] He indicated her large bulk.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> pleasantly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and when}} <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> his {{expression}} was kindly--anything but cruel or vindictive.|$|R
60|$|We {{said good-bye}} {{at the club}} front door. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> benevolently {{from the top of}} the steps.|$|R
6000|$|I fairly held {{my breath}} a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from his pillow. [...] "What {{do you mean by}} all the rest?" ...|$|R
60|$|Way {{was made}} in the crowd, and the old gentleman pressed forward. When he got near, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and then {{proceeded}} to address to me a lengthy, but no doubt kindly meant, speech in Scandinavian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{it may be}} so." [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if out of the distance, {{with the}} serenest kindliness. [...] "But you and I are going to share the {{temperate}} zone--a cool, steady, Trade Wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me! Oh! let me. I {{have often}} held a baby. Come to me, my precious. Don't {{you know your}} aunt, your papa's own sister? There, <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> He will come! You know me, you pretty one?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell ye {{more than}} that," [...] said he. [...] "It's {{not only the}} men; it's me. I'm frich'ened, Davie." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> across <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "No," [...] he continued, [...] "what we want is to be shut of him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled,</b> {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{gave me a}} pick, and I took it, meditatin' an insurrection on the spot; {{but there}} was the guards handlin' the Winchesters careless, and I come to the {{conclusion}} that discretion was the best part of filibusterin'. There was about a hundred of us in the gang startin' out to work, and the word was given to move. I steps out of the ranks and goes up to that General De Vega man, who was smokin' a cigar and gazin' upon the scene with satisfactions and glory. <b>He</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> polite and devilish. 'Plenty work,' says he, 'for big, strong mans in Guatemala. Yes. T'irty dollars in the month. Good pay. Ah, yes. You strong, brave man. Bimeby we push those railroad in the capital very quick. They want you go work now. Adios, strong mans.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> as if I should {{appreciate}} the joke, {{and it hurt}} me to keep grave, but suspecting what a bad time {{he was going to}} have, I thought I had better not join him in any levity.|$|E
60|$|I am {{sure that}} my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking him And then his face lighted up {{and he gave me}} his hand. And <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and again at the General, as much as {{to say that it was}} all over. He has a {{wonderful}} smile.|$|E
6000|$|He {{must have}} seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, [...] "I am {{only too happy to}} have been of service! Oh, God!" [...] he cried suddenly, {{struggling}} to a sitting posture and pointing to me. [...] "It was worth for this to die! Look! Look!" ...|$|E
60|$|Johnson I found lying {{full length}} on the {{forecastle}} head, {{staring at the}} troubled churn of the forefoot, and I remembered with horror the suggestion Wolf Larsen had made. It seemed likely to bear fruit. I tried to break in on the man’s morbid thoughts by calling him away, but <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> sadly <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and refused to obey.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> almost <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the desolation of his surrender, {{which was}} indeed practically, by this time, so {{complete}} that I {{ought to have}} left it there. But I was infatuated--I was blind with victory, though even then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was already that of added separation. [...] "Was it to everyone?" [...] I asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's well," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> such a sweet {{sympathetic}} <b>smile</b> as <b>he</b> felt {{my pulse}} with his finger. [...] "Confidence {{is the first}} great requisite in a patient: it's half the battle. You're not seriously hurt, I hope, but you're very much shaken. Whether {{you like it or}} not, you'll have to stop here now for some days at least, till you're thoroughly recovered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Onward {{above the}} marshes, {{and now we}} stood upon the Ethiopian's Head, and {{gathered}} round, watching us earnestly, were {{the faces of the}} Arabs, our companions who drowned in the sea beneath. Job was among them also, and <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sadly and shook his head, as though he wished to accompany us and could not.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Rochester had {{sometimes}} read my unspoken {{thoughts with}} an acumen to me incomprehensible: {{in the present}} instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a certain smile he had of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he shed it over me now.|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} out Atterbury's instructions. I {{played the}} Rocky Mountain capitalist without ruching or frills. The way I deposited apple peelings to my credit {{in a drawer}} when any customers came in made Hetty Green look like a spendthrift. I could hear Atterbury saying to victims, as <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> indulgent and venerating, [...] "That's our vice-president, Colonel Pickens [...] . fortune in Western investments [...] . delightfully plain manners, but [...] . could sign his check for half a million [...] . simple as a child [...] . wonderful head [...] . conservative and careful almost to a fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was admiring {{him when}} he stopped and seemed {{to realize that there}} was a fine {{presence}} there somewhere. <b>He</b> tried to <b>smile,</b> but <b>he</b> was out of <b>smiles.</b> <b>He</b> looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "David," [...] said he, [...] "you are {{an earnest}} lad, {{with a head}} to learn, and you will. When your father comes, I shall talk with him." [...] He paused--"I knew him," [...] said he, [...] "I knew him ere you were born. A just man, and upright, but with a great sorrow. We must never be hasty in our judgments. But {{you will never be}} hasty, David," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You are a good {{companion}} for Nicholas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{only one}} life to live, Hugh," [...] <b>he</b> answered, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "and {{we might as}} well get all out of it we can. A few years more or less doesn't make much difference--and I ought to be satisfied. I'd resign now, to please my wife, to please my friends, but we can't trust this {{governor}} to appoint a safe man. How little we suspected when we elected him that he'd become infected. You never can tell, in these days, can you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Once, I remember, as {{we passed}} over the Gemmi, and walked along {{the border of the}} melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been {{dislodged}} from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. In an instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the spring-time at that spot. He said nothing, but <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the air of a man who sees the fulfillment of that which he had expected.|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Mr Crimble helplessly. [...] "But there," [...] and {{he brushed}} his knees with his handkerchief, [...] "I fear {{you are too}} much of a reader for me, and--and critic. For that very reason I do hope, Miss M., you will {{sometimes}} contrive to pay a visit to St Peter's. Mother Church has room for all, you know, in her--about her footstool." [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very kindly. [...] "And our organist, Mr Temple, has been treating us to some charmingly quaint old carols--at least the words seem a little quaint to a modern ear. But I cannot boast of being a student of poetry. Parochial work leaves little time even for the classics:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly I fell asleep, {{and passed}} from {{thinking}} to dreaming. My dream {{was but a}} prolongation of the thoughts I had been turning over in my waking mind. I was still in Australia; still on the verandah of our wooden house; and my mamma was there, and papa beside her. I knew it was papa; for I held his hand and played with him. But he was so much altered, so grave and severe; though <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> good-humouredly. Mamma was sitting behind, with baby on her lap. It seemed to me quite natural she should be there with baby. The scene was so distinct--very vivid and clear. It persisted for many minutes, perhaps even hours. It burnt itself into my brain. At last, it woke me up by its very intensity.|$|E

6000|$|... "If it hadn't {{been for}} you, sir, and your brave fellows," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>smiling</b> across <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "we should be ten fathoms deep by this time. As to the Belinda, {{she was a}} leaky old tub and well insured, so neither the owners nor I are likely to break our hearts over her." ...|$|R
60|$|This happy occasion, as I thought, {{of coming}} into a Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots {{merchant}} upon it. <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> that, telling <b>me</b> not to rejoice too soon; for, said he, except the Russian soldiers in garrison, {{and a few}} inhabitants of the cities upon the road, {{all the rest of}} this country, for above a thousand miles, is inhabited by the most ignorant and barbarous Pagans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Awfully!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> heroically, and the {{touching}} little bravery {{of it was}} {{enhanced by}} his actually flushing with pain. He had picked up his hat, which he had brought in, and stood twirling {{it in a way}} that gave me, even as I was just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of what I was doing. To do it in ANY way was an act of violence, for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn't it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read into our situation a clearness it couldn't have had at the time, for I seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to come. So we circled about, with terrors and scruples, like fighters not daring to close. But it was for each other we feared! That kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised. [...] "I'll tell you everything," [...] Miles said--"I mean I'll tell you anything you like. You'll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I WILL tell you--I WILL. But not now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most extraordinary!" [...] said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. [...] "You {{never heard}} of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or Guppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of shillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the paper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So well-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you say? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I think? I think," [...] said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very shrewd look and shaking her right {{forefinger}} in a most significant manner, [...] "that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long time!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now that's very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other day--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it, and he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and <b>HE</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from his bench. But it's great good fortune, is it not? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage. Oh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shrink from}} putting on paper the sentimental {{side of my}} nature, and indeed I could give no {{adequate}} idea of my affection for that drum. And then there was Nick, who had been lost to me for five years! My impulse was to charge the procession, seize Nick and the drum together, and drag them back to my room; but the futility and danger of such a course were apparent, and the caution for which I am noted prevented my undertaking it. The procession, augmented by all those to whom sufficient power of motion remained, cheered by the helpless but willing ones on the ground, swept on {{down the street and}} through the town. Even at this late day I shame to write it! Behold me, David Ritchie, Federalist, execrably sober, {{at the head of the}} column behind the leader. Was it twenty minutes, or an hour, that we paraded? This I know, that we slighted no street in the little town of Louisville. What was my bearing,--whether proud or angry or carelessly indifferent,--I know not. The glare of Joe Handy's torch fell on my face, Joe Handy's arm and that of another gentleman, the worse for liquor, were linked in mine, and they saw fit to applaud at every step my conversion to the cause of Liberty. We passed time and time again the respectable door-yards of my Federalist friends, and I felt their eyes upon me with that look which the angels have for the fallen. Once, in front of Mr. Wharton's house, Mr. Handy burned my hair, apologized, staggered, and I took the torch! And I used it to good advantage in saving the drum from capture. For Mr. Temple, with all the will in the world, had begun to stagger. At length, after marching seemingly half the night, they halted by common consent before the house of a prominent Democrat who shall be nameless, and, after some minutes of vain importuning, Nick, with a tattoo on the drum, marched boldly up to the gate and into the yard. A desperate cunning came to my aid. I flung away the torch, leaving the head of the column in darkness, broke from Mr. Handy's embrace, and, seizing Nick by the arm, led him onward through the premises, he drumming with great docility. Followed by a few stragglers only (some of whom went down in contact with the trees of the orchard), we came to a gate at the back which I knew well, which led directly into the little yard that fronted my own rooms behind Mr. Crede's store. Pulling Nick through the gate, I slammed it, and he was only beginning to protest when I had him safe within my door, and the bolt slipped behind him. As I struck a light something fell to the floor with a crash, an odor of alcohol filled the air, and as the candle caught the flame I saw a shattered whiskey bottle at my feet and a room which had been given over to carousing. In spite of my feelings I could not but laugh at the perfectly irresistible figure my cousin made, as he stood before me with the drum slung in front of him. His hat was gone, his dust-covered clothes awry, but <b>he</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> benignly and without a trace of surprise.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> {{paused and}} <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> deeply, and tapped slowly {{on the edge}} of his desk with the green phial. [...] "I think I know the stuff... Already I've got {{something}} coming." [...] The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end. [...] "And it may be, it may be--I shouldn't be surprised--it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lady Hakima {{the sister}} of Imam Al-Hadi said: “There was a young lady with me named Narjis who I was {{bringing}} up. None other than me brought her up since I had her. Abu Mohammad Al-Askari peace be upon him came to us one day {{and looked at her}} so I said: My master, do you want anything from her? He said: Us the successors do not give women looks that are suspicious, rather I am looking out of astonishment because the blessed birth will come from her. Lady Hakima said: I said: Do you want me to give her in marriage to you? He said: Ask my father regarding this. So I went to my brother and when I entered <b>he</b> was <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said: Oh Hakima, you came to ask me for my permission regarding the young lady? Give her in marriage to Abu Mohammad Al-Askari for Allah loves for you to be a part in this matter. So I made her up and gave her in marriage to Abu Mohammad Al-Askari peace be upon him.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{like to sit}} {{and have}} a talk {{sometimes}} with that odd little chap that was myself long ago. I think he likes it too, for he comes so often of an evening when I am alone with my pipe, listening to the whispering of the flames. I see his solemn little face looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the scented smoke as it floats upward, and I <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> him; and <b>he</b> <b>smiles</b> back <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but his is such a grave, old-fashioned smile. We chat about old times; and {{now and then he}} takes me by the hand, and then we slip through the black bars of the grate and down the dusky glowing caves to the land that lies behind the firelight. There we find the days that used to be, and we wander along them together. He tells me as we walk all he thinks and feels. I laugh at him now and then, but the next moment I wish I had not, for he looks so grave I am ashamed of being frivolous. Besides, it is not showing proper respect to one so much older than myself--to one who was myself so very long before I became myself.|$|R
