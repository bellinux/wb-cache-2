5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{body and the}} pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came {{to be associated with}} decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrivals, ships bearing goods {{from around the}} world came to San Francisco as well.

Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more buildable land in the boomtown.|$|E

On 14 July 1933, the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.

This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E
