5|$|Body {{impressions}} of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that some}} terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the tail of another <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The father {{panel is}} {{signed and dated}} on both sides, <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E

25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches {{of the social}} sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{thought of as a}} spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.|$|E

Fighting his way through a horde of zombies, he finds Wu (James Hong), who makes him undergo a series of tests, including fighting fire-demons and a dragon, before telling him that twenty years previously, the KGB sent one of their top agents to L.A. However, he soon lost loyalty to Russia, and turned to a life of crime in the United States. The agent was Rasputin Kuznetsov, aka Rocky.|$|E

500|$|In some years, this waxwing irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit {{on which the}} birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the largest ever irruption in Europe, {{in the winter of}} 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} waxwings were recorded in Germany alone.

500|$|Rowe {{announced}} {{that she was pregnant}} with Jackson's second child in November 1997. The baby was to be a girl and named Paris, after the French city in which her parents said she was conceived. On April 3, 1998, blue-eyed Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born. Her middle names come from Michael and his mother, Katherine. Jackson later claimed that he was so anxious following the birth of his daughter, that he [...] "snatched" [...] her and ran straight home [...] "with all the placenta and everything all over her". Rowe later confirmed that Jackson had the placenta frozen. Following the birth, Jackson's associates contacted Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in Rome, {{in the hope that the}} Pontiff would personally baptize the pop star's daughter.

500|$|A {{number of}} words in common use at the time {{are thought to be}} {{possible}} sources for the name [...] "cricket". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called creckett. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an early reference to the sport, a 1533 poem attributed to John Skelton describes Flemish weavers as [...] "kings of crekettes", a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755), he derived cricket from [...] "cryce, Saxon, a stick". In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick, though this may have been the origin of croquet. Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church, the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, [...] "cricket" [...] derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., [...] "with the stick chase"). Gillmeister believes the sport itself had a Flemish origin but [...] "the jury is still out" [...] on the matter.|$|E

The AIF responded with 441 and Collins produced the outstanding batting performance of the entire tour with a magnificent knock of 235 in 315 minutes with 23 boundaries. South Africa scored 359 to avoid the innings defeat, Zulch this time reaching his century with 135. The AIF then scored 47 for two to win on the fourth day.|$|E
2500|$|Chambers {{took the}} {{publication}} of the Origin as an opportunity to release a new edition of Vestiges and respond to Darwin's comments, lamenting that Darwin had misunderstood the Vestiges.

His book, in no essential respect, contradicts the present: on the contrary...it expresses substantially the same general ideas." [...] In perhaps a gross simplification, Chambers concludes that [...] "The difference seems to be in words, not in facts or effects." [...] At the very least, Chambers saw in Darwin a much needed ally – one that the former simply could not afford to have against him.|$|E
