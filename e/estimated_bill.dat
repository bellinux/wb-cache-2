The reason for this could be that many Nigerians do not really pay for the electricity they consume. In many houses, the meters installed by PHCN are no longer functioning.

40|$|Abstract. Energy meter {{monitoring}} {{with automatic}} tariff calculation {{is a project}} that can produce the output from energy meter to prepare a bill of electricity. Energy meter is a device that measure the amount of electric energy consumed. In Malaysia, the meter of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) travels for a long distance and take the reading manually to prepare the bill by visiting inside each of consumer house. This is high dependent on human forces. Sometimes the absence of consumer during billing process visiting make difficult to the meter reader to get the reader. Moreover many consumers are {{not satisfied with the}} <b>estimate</b> <b>bills</b> which are calculated based on average consumption. Soaring <b>bill</b> by <b>estimate</b> <b>bills</b> of electricity which consumer have to pay extra for the electricity billing.

40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and water blocking material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water blocking of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking. To address these new challenges, new water blocking materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures. The new materials included a thin water blocking tape for use in power conductors, a new high-capacity water blocking yarn designed for use in conductors and two new water blocking filler yarns designed {{for use in the}} interstitial areas between conductors in LV and MV multicore cables In addition, methods were developed to analyze power cable geometry and produce an <b>estimated</b> <b>bill</b> of materials for water blocking. This information proved useful to cables makers for verification trials of new water blocked cable designs...|$|E

In protest, Bowser led his faction into opposition, and at the election in November, Bowser's followers won 27 seats, to Labor's 18, the Peacock Liberals' 12 and the Victorian Farmers Union's four. Peacock resigned and Bowser became Premier. He rescinded Peacock's rail fares increases, but had no answer to the larger problem of railway finance.

50|$|For {{the next}} four years, Alexander's main role was again as the Co-op's Parliamentary Secretary. He led {{opposition}} to renewed government plans to impose Corporation Tax on co-op stores, a fight that was lost {{this time with the}} 1933 Finance Bill. He also worked to have consumer interests represented on the new agricultural marketing boards. He was active in the Brotherhood movement (an organisation for nonconformists), spoke at rallies for the League of Nations, wrote columns for Reynold's News and gave lectures on the BBC. Regaining his Hillsborough seat in 1935, Alexander became a front bench spokesman on trade and foreign affairs. Attlee, now leader of the PLP, asked him to join a new defence committee, working with Shinwell and Jack Lawson to reverse the pacifist ideals which had prevailed under Lansbury. Alexander had been warning of the dangers posed by fascism for several years, and criticised the government's policy of appeasement. In 1937, with Hugh Dalton and Hastings Bertram Lees-Smith, he persuaded the PLP to put aside its mistrust of the Baldwin government and support the Service <b>Estimates</b> <b>Bill</b> which began rearmament. In October 1938, he closed the debate on the Munich Pact, attacking the government's abandonment of the Sudeten Germans.|$|R
5000|$|Utility {{companies}} {{propose that}} from a consumer perspective, smart metering offers potential benefits to householders. These include, a) an end to <b>estimated</b> <b>bills,</b> which are {{a major source of}} complaints for many customers b) a tool to help consumers better manage their energy purchases - stating that smart meters with a display outside their homes could provide up-to-date information on gas and electricity consumption and in doing so help people to manage their energy use and reduce their energy bills. Electricity pricing usually peaks at certain predictable times of the day and the season. In particular, if generation is constrained, prices can rise if power from other jurisdictions or more costly generation is brought online. Proponents assert that billing customers at a higher rate for peak times will encourage consumers to adjust their consumption habits to be more responsive to market prices and assert further, that regulatory and market design agencies hope these [...] "price signals" [...] could delay the construction of additional generation or at least the purchase of energy from higher priced sources, thereby controlling the steady and rapid increase of electricity prices. There are some concerns, however, that low income and vulnerable consumers may not benefit from intraday time-of-use tariffs.|$|R
