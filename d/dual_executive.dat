40|$|Using a {{proprietary}} database {{for the largest}} 158 European companies during 1999 - 2004, I find that transparency of executive pay disclosures and sensitivity of executive pay to perjormance increase with the pro-portion of top executives serving as company directors and with <b>dual</b> chief <b>executive</b> ofSicer (CEO) and board chairs. These relations strengthen in countries with more protection for outside shareholders. The positive marginal effects of executive directors (i. e., insiders) on transparency of pay disclosures and sensitivity of pay to perjormance are not significant when (I) insiders already have the numerical major-ity on boards, (2) CEOs are board chairs, and (3) pay levels and com-pany ownership of executives are relatively high. Overall, the evidence supports the optimal-contracting argument over the rent-seeking argu-ment.

The stern frown worn by the late president Thomas Klestil while swearing in Wolfgang Schüssel's controversial cabinets was at the time widely considered the strongest unilateral political statement made by any Austrian president.

In mixed systems where either the president or the prime minister is the dominant actor, then a divided executive will not affect democratisation. However, where both the president and prime minister have significant independent powers, then a divided executive should {{have a negative impact on}} democratisation because of the potential for destabilising intra-executive conflict.

40|$|Background Whereas {{executive}} functioning {{has been}} found to decline in healthy ageing (e. g. Daigneault et al., 1992), dual task ability (Della Sala et al., 2010) and socio-behavioural functioning (e. g. MacPherson et al., 2002) appear to remain stable with age. Impairment in dual tasking (e. g. Logie et al., 2004), executive functioning (Baudic et al., 2006) and socio-behavioural functioning (e. g. Bruen et al., 2008) {{has been found}} in many people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent research with people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) has suggested a relationship between dual tasking and socio-behavioural functioning, with patients impaired in dual tasking demonstrating greater behavioural dysfunction (Alderman, 1996; Foley et al., 2010). Objectives & Design To investigate <b>dual</b> tasking, <b>executive</b> functioning and socio-behavioural functioning in healthy and pathological ageing; between groups of healthy younger (N= 25) and healthy older (N= 25) participants and in three case studies of people with AD, using a battery of measures. Results No significant differences in performance between healthy younger and older participant groups were found in dual tasking or socio-behavioural functioning. Healthy older participants performed significantly poorer than healthy younger participants in executive functioning (assessed using total raw scores). None of the three cases presented in this study were found to have impairment in dual task performance. All cases had some impairment in executive and socio-behavioural functioning. No association between performance on a measure of dual tasking and measures of socio-behavioural functioning was found in participants with AD. Conclusions These findings provide support for previous research in healthy ageing. Findings from the three cases are explored, and discussed with reference to the limitations of the study. It is suggested that the exploration of the association between dual tasking and socio-behavioural functioning in people with AD is an important issue for future research...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concludes that}} the Chief <b>Executive's</b> <b>dual</b> {{accountability}} need not be an impossible mission, either from a theoretical or an empirical perspective. That said, the practice of dual accountability {{must take into account}} the significance of the liberal notion of accountability that has emerged in Hong Kong. Despite the possibility of further demarcating its functions and roles, the smooth functioning of the office of the Chief Executive depends on the willingness and the ability to negotiate solutions between the contending parties. It also depends on the participants to internalize the values in both responsiveness and responsibility. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) This dissertation examines the dual accountability of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the People's Republic of China. As stipulated in Article 43 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Chief Executive "shall be accountable to the Central People's Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [...] " The Basic Law, thus, creates a situation where one agent serves two principals, while raising a theoretical question for the liberal notion of political accountability. With its emphasis on sanction as the indispensable tool for reinforcing responsiveness, the liberal notion of political accountability implies that one agent cannot possibly serve two principals, unless the two principals seek identical goals and conceptualize the role of agent in the same way, and exercise sanctioning powers with full agreement. The dual accountability experiment hence puts the logic and limits of the liberal accountability theory to the test. This study begins with the assumption that the Chief <b>Executive's</b> <b>dual</b> accountability is an impossible mission, as liberal accountability theory would imply. In searching for a remedy, different connotations and models of accountability are examined, the politico-legal framework of the office of the Chief Executive is reviewed and the dynamics among the competing, players [...] -the people in the Hong Kong SAR and the Central People's Government as the principals, and the Chief Executive as the agent [...] -are analyzed. The possibilities of the construct are then evaluated and remedies to it deliberated. Poon Kit. "August 2005. "Adviser: Kuan Hsin-chi.

However, few studies have looked at the potential synergetic effects of combining physical and cognitive training in a single study. Prior trials on combined training have led to interesting yet equivocal results. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of combined physical and cognitive interventions on physical fitness and neuropsychological performance in healthy older adults. Methods: Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to one of four training combinations using a 2 × 2 factorial design. The physical intervention was a mixed aerobic and resistance training program, and the cognitive intervention was a dual-task (DT) training program. Stretching and toning exercises and computer lessons were used as active control conditions. Physical and cognitive measures were collected pre- and postintervention. Results: All groups showed equivalent improvements in measures of functional mobility. The aerobic–strength condition led to larger effect size in lower body strength, independently of cognitive training. All groups showed improved speed of processing and inhibition abilities, but only participants who took part in the DT training, independently of physical training, showed increased task-switching abilities. The level of functional mobility after intervention was significantly associated with task-switching abilities. Conclusion: Combined training did not yield synergetic effects. However, DT training did lead to transfer effects on executive performance in neuropsychological tests. Both aerobic-resistance training and stretching-toning exercises can improve functional mobility in older adults.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the interaction between two executive function processes, inhibition and updating, through analyses of behavioral, neurophysiological, and effective connectivity metrics. Although, many {{studies have focused on}} behavioral effects of executive function processes individually, few studies have examined the dynamic causal interactions between these two functions. A total of twenty participants from a local university performed a dual task combing flanker and n-back experimental paradigms, and completed the Operation Span Task designed to measure working memory capacity. We found that both behavioral (accuracy and reaction time) and neurophysiological (P 300 amplitude and alpha band power) metrics on the inhibition task (i. e., flanker task) were influenced by the updating load (n-back level) and modulated by working memory capacity. Using independent component analysis, source localization (DIPFIT), and Granger Causality analysis of the EEG time-series data, the present study demonstrated that manipulation of cognitive demand in a <b>dual</b> <b>executive</b> function task influenced the causal neural network. We compared connectivity across three updating loads (n-back levels) and found that experimental manipulation of working memory load enhanced causal connectivity of a large-scale neurocognitive network.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of acute physical activity on cognitive tasks of 37, 7 th and 8 th grade females. Subjects' cognitive performance following acute physical activity was hypothesized to be significantly better on five tasks (choice reaction time, probed memory, <b>dual</b> task, vigilance, <b>executive</b> function) used in the study, with {{no significant difference in}} performance hypothesized for the sixth (simple reaction time). The study assessed cognitive tasks twice, following a 30 minute sedentary period and 30 minutes of physical activity. The within subject design compared the independent variable of physical activity level (activity or none) on the dependent variables simple reaction time, choice reaction time, dual task-tracking and simple reaction time, vigilance, probed memory, and executive function. Results indicated that for the simple reaction time task subjects demonstrated significantly faster (reaction and movement) times following acute physical activity. For choice reaction time the percent of correct responses was significantly higher following sedentary behavior, while for choice reaction and movement time, subjects were significantly faster following acute physical activity. Analysis of probed memory reported no significance between the scores following the two activity sessions. Analysis of dual task reported no significance for two subcomponents, however a significant difference was reported for the third subcomponent. Analysis of vigilance reported subjects demonstrated significantly improved performance on two subcomponents following physical activity. Analysis of the third subcomponent did not report significance. Performance on the executive function task was mixed with no significance reported for subjects between the following physical activity and following sedentary behavior scores, while significance was reported with regard to time to complete the task.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} has suggested that patients suffering from the motor disorders Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) also suffer from cognitive deficits. Although the prevalence of cognitive impairments in these patient groups is well documented there remains no explicit theory to explain the source of these impairments, with two main theories competing as an explanation; slowed information processing speed and executive dysfunction. The aim of the current study was to assess the specific cognitive impairments of both patient groups, and determine which competing theory was most relevant to each group. As participants within these patient groups are more susceptible to displaying mild to severe motor slowing or motor impairments, inspection time tasks as opposed to reaction time tasks were used, controlling for impaired motor responses. Eight MS patients, eight matched healthy controls and eight PD patients with eight matched controls were tested on a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess specific cognitive impairments. Three experimental tasks were used to directly assess the theories underlying the cause of any cognitive impairment found: a Pre-Loaded <b>Dual</b> Task (assessed <b>executive</b> dysfunction), VIT (information processing speed) and Letter RSVP (information processing speed). PD patients were not found to be impaired on any neuropsychological or experimental tasks when compared with their respective matched controls. MS patients were impaired on a number of neuropsychological tasks which directly assessed executive function; working memory, attention and planning. MS patients were significantly impaired on the Pre-Loaded Dual Task and showed a trend towards significance on the Letter RSVP task. It was argued that the cognitive impairments displayed by the MS patients were due to an executive dysfunction. However, as the study assessed small sample groups it was argued that cognitive impairments in MS patients may also be as a result of slowed information processing speed, combining both competing theories, although the current study did not have the statistical power to show a statistically significant difference in MS patient and control scores in tests of slowed information processing speed...|$|R
