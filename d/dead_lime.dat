ASI reports of 2006 indicate that extensive restoration works of many heritage monuments were carried out at the Bawana Mosque and also at the Jami Masjid, fort walls, Kevada Masjid, Lila Gumbaz ki Masjid, Sikandar Shah Tomb and Sikander tomb, {{which resulted in a}} slight increase in tourist traffic to the sites. ASI had already spent Rs 2.25 crores (about US $ 0.45 million) on the conservation activity in a four-year period and a further Rs 1.15 crores (US $ 0.23 million) was allotted for more restoration works at the sites. A follow-up report in 2009 described extensive conservation work subsequent to earthquake damage.|$|E

The time delay limits die maximum allowable gain required for system stability. Modem control dieory provides a scheme called Smidi predictor which {{has the potential to}} improve control performance significantly. The method is based on model internal control which works well if the dynamics of die plant are slow compared to the time delay. In this paper we analyze die performance improvement that can be achieved in die TTF rf control system where die time delay is dominated by computational delay. In this system the time delay of 4 microseconds and sampling period of 1 microsecond are short compared to the cavity time constant of 700 microseconds. Attention is paid to both theoretical and practical aspects...|$|R

This effort is apparent also in the field of the refractory materials, therefore also <b>dead</b> burned <b>lime</b> (CaO) as a refractory material for steel industry is considered. A low hydration and corrosion resistance are the reasons why the CaO refractory has not been widely applied. Research results achieved recently as well as necessary effort for future research activities are discussed in this paper. Razvoj novih materijala i tehnike je bitan za intenzifikaciju industrijske proizvodnje. Takvo nastojanje je očito i na polju vatrostalnog materijala, zato se razmatra i mogućnost uporabe vapna kao takvog materijala u proizvodnji čelika. Međutim, (ekstenzivna) hidracija i neotpornost na koroziju su razlozi zbog kojih CaO do sada nije imao širu primjenu kao vatrostalni material...|$|R

The isolation of sick people in hospitals or charities at the outsides of the cities was another important measure to stop the smallpox infection. These institutions took care of patients and provided them food and medicine. During the 1797 and 1798 outbreak, they also provided inoculation and were called inoculation houses. Although inoculation was practiced, the miasma theory of disease was still believed.|$|R
