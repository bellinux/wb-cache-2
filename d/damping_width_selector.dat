The viscous relaxation time is estimated and is used to determine the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is applicable and {{to understand the nature of}} sound waves in the density response near the superfluid phase transition. By collecting the best knowledge on the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity known so far, we calculate the various diffusion coefficients and obtain the <b>damping</b> <b>width</b> of the (first and second) sounds. We find that the <b>damping</b> <b>width</b> of the first sound is greatly enhanced across the superfluid transition and very close to the transition the second sound might be resolved in the density response for the transferred momentum up to the half of Fermi momentum.

40|$|The damping of {{collective}} rotational motion is studied microscopically, {{making use of}} shell model calculations based on the cranked Nilsson deformed mean-field and on residual two-body interactions, and focusing on {{the shape of the}} gamma-gamma correlation spectra and on its systematic behavior.

The rotational <b>damping</b> <b>width</b> is affected by the shell structure, and is very sensitive to the position of the Fermi surface, besides mass number, spin and deformation. This produces a rich variety of features in the rotational damping phenomena. The collective rotation of deformed nuclei becomes a damped motion as the nuclei are thermally excited [1, 2, 3, 4].

The test is adaptive to the 2 ̆ 2 large p, small n 2 ̆ 2 situations without assuming a specific parametric distribution for the data. For covariance estimation, we propose a band <b>width</b> <b>selector</b> for the banding covariance estimator of Bickel and Levina (2008 a) by minimizing an empirical estimate of the expected squared Frobenius norms of the estimation error matrix. The ratio consistency of the band <b>width</b> <b>selector</b> to the underlying band width is established. We provide a lower bound for the coverage probability of the underlying band width being contained in an interval around the band width estimate. Extensions to the band width selection for the tapering estimator and threshold level selection for the thresholding covariance estimator are made. We also consider the detection of rare and faint signals in high-dimensional count data. Under Generalized Linear Models, a thresholding statistic based on the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) is proposed. A multi-threshold test is constructed by maximizing the standardized thresholding statistic over a set of thresholds. Extensions to Generalized Linear Mixed Models are made, where Gauss quadratures and data cloning are used to approximate the MLEs of such models.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} the pressure loss characteristics of thin, single-blade flat dampers in square branch ducts in the turbulent region. The damper pressure loss characteristics and the interactions between the damper blade and shaft have been studied at various <b>damper</b> <b>width</b> ratios {{to take account of}} the damper leakage effects. At damper angles > 10 °, the damper pressure loss characteristics determined for damper -width ratios of 0. 5 to 1. 414 are found to be independent of the shaft sizes for typical rectangular and circular shafts with blockage area ratios ≤ 0. 16. The damper pressure loss coefficients are observed to have collapsed onto a single curve within a ± 10 % accuracy for <b>damper</b> <b>width</b> ratios of 0. 9 to 1. 414. By applying this relationship to square, flat airtight dampers in square branch ducts, the desired flow characteristics for branch ducts fitted with proportional damper controller-actuators can be achieved within a maximum deviation of ± 10 %. This helps solve the nonlinearity problem in the installed damper characteristics for large, complex, variable air volume systems having branch ducts with different resistances. Using a graphical approach, the required tuning parameter values for square, single-blade airtight dampers have also been determined for use by control system designers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The damping rate of hot giant dipole {{resonances}} (GDR) is investigated. Besides Landau damping {{we consider}} collisions and density fluctuations as {{contributions to the}} damping of GDR. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function method we derive a non-Markovian kinetic equation. The linearization of the latter one leads to complex dispersion relations. The complex solution provides the centroid energy and the <b>damping</b> <b>width</b> of giant resonances. The experimental <b>damping</b> <b>widths</b> are the full width half maximum (FWHM) and can be reproduced by the full width of the structure function. Within simple finite size scaling we give a relation between the minimal interaction strength which is required for a collective oscillation and the clustersize.

The inclusion of a conserving relaxation time approximation allows to find the $T^ 2 $-dependence of the damping rate with a temperature known from the Fermi-liquid theory.
