2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were sitting in this bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there. He said, ‘You’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film in Antarctica. It’s just like out here, in the wasteland. It’s spectacular.’ And that always stuck in my head.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} incriminating indictments of the labor spy {{business}} may have been the testimony of Albert Balanow (some sources list the name as Ballin or Blanow) during an investigation of the detective agencies' roles during the Red Scare. Albert Balanow had worked with both the Burns Detective Agency and the Thiel Detective Agency. Balanow testified that the Red Scare was all about shaking down businessmen for protection money.

Having already declined the band's employ {{in the distant past}} due to scheduling issues, he now accommodated. He admonished them, [...] "Don't try to write a hit. ... You have to have your love in mind, and a hit record might happen." [...] Scheff later reflected that Sisyphus [...] "was our statement ... taking all the motives away from , 'I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> hit; I've got to use outside writers' material'".

2500|$|Even {{though most}} of their {{original}} land was taken over, {{this was the first}} turning point for the Pomo people. They had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of, and even though they had to settle on poor, isolated land, they finally <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> stride towards tradition and basket weaving. [...] From 1852-1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them. Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.|$|E

5000|$|Ritchie Blackmore, in particular, stated {{publicly}} {{that he was}} not overly pleased with Fireball. He said of the production: [...] "That {{was a bit of a}} disaster, because it was thrown together in the studio. Management pressure, we had no time. 'You gotta play here, here, there, then you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> LP.' I told them, 'you want an LP, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> give us time.' But they didn't.

2500|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major rewrite to the script. According to Hudlin, in the {{original}} draft, Eddie's character Marcus [...] "never decides anything, things are decided for him by the different women. So, we finally realized {{he had to make}} an affirmative choice. Going through the script with a buddy of mine, we talked about it, and my buddy Tre said 'look, he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision.' And I said, 'you're right. He's got to reject her, and choose her.' And it seems so obvious now, I'm like 'what's wrong with me?
