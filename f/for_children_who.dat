5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations <b>for</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E
