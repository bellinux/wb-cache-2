5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E

In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other.

In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings.

500|$|In modern times, the {{familiar}} Western layout, as left-to-right linear Chinese, {{has become more}} popular. Similar to Latin-letter text, the horizontal rows are read from left to right, then {{top of the page}} to the bottom.

[...] The government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) followed suit in 2004 for official documents. [...] The use of punctuation has also become more common, whether the text is written in columns or rows. [...] The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts, although some marks are particular to Asian languages: for example, the double and single quotation marks (『 』 and 「 」); the hollow period dot (。), which is otherwise used <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary period full-stop; and a special kind of comma called an enumeration comma (、), which is used to separate items in a list, as opposed to clauses in a sentence.|$|E

A Heroic ability in Heroes of the Storm is a player-chosen ability, accessible to players once the hero reaches level 10. However, in Heroes of the Storm, players {{had no control over}} Tracer's Heroic ability, which was also unlocked immediately. Her core skillset is teleportation, [...] "which includes a quick blink strike in any direction and the 'Recall' mechanic that rewinds her back to the location she was at three seconds ago." [...] Chris Thursten of PC Gamer wrote that [...] "the fact that she literally runs circles around certain heroes, coupled with the notion that she defies the rules of the game, is exactly why [...] impressed by her design".

2500|$|There are {{compelling}} theoretical {{reasons to}} believe that, {{aside from the fact}} that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric charge and spin), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties. This means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes (if unstable). It also implies that, for example, a star made up of antimatter (an [...] "antistar") will shine <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary star. This idea was tested experimentally in 2016 by the ALPHA experiment, which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen. The results, which are identical to that of hydrogen, confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter.|$|E

Each year an average of 40 thousand visitors pass through Loppiano.|$|E

2500|$|Since the new {{aircraft}} {{would require a}} significant amount of engineering work in untested waters, the first order placed was actually for a one-third scale version of the XB-35 dubbed the Northrop N-9M (M standing for model). This aircraft would be used to gather flight test data on the Flying Wing design, which would then be used in designing the big XB-35. It would also be used as a flight trainer, to familiarize pilots with the radical, all-wing concept. Early in 1942, design work on the XB-35 itself began in earnest. Unlike conventional aircraft, truly [...] "tailless" [...] flying wings cannot use a rudder for lateral control as it was absent, so a set of clamshell-like, double split flaps (so called flaperon, a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on the trailing edge of the wingtips were used. When aileron control was input, they were deflected up or down as a single unit, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aileron. When rudder input was made, the two surfaces on one side opened, top and bottom, creating drag, and yawing the aircraft. By applying input to both rudder pedals, both sets of surfaces were deployed creating drag so that the airspeed or the glide angle could be manipulated.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the audio}} {{engineer}} has {{made all the}} adjustments to a signal (e.g., the lead vocalist's singing through a microphone), such as equalization, adding effects, and so on, the signal is then electronically routed to {{a section of the}} mixing console known as [...] "bus", also called a [...] "mix group", [...] "subgroup" [...] or simply [...] "group". A group of signals may be routed through an additional bus before being sent to the main bus to allow the engineer to control the levels of several related signals at once. [...] For example, all of the different microphones for a drum set might be sent to their own bus so that the volume of the entire drum set sound can be controlled with a single fader or a pair of faders, rather than the audio engineer having to adjust all of the different drums and cymbals' mic volumes. A bus can often be processed <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> individual input channel, allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually.|$|E
2500|$|Electric violins have a {{magnetic}} or piezoelectric pickup that converts string vibration to an electric signal. A patch cable or wireless transmitter sends {{the signal to}} an amplifier of a PA system. Electric violins are usually constructed as such, but a pickup {{can be added to}} a conventional acoustic violin. An electric violin with a resonating body that produces listening-level sound independently of the electric elements can be called an electro-acoustic violin. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle. [...] The body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood. These violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or PA system. [...] Some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are hooked up to the violin. The first specially built electric violins date back to 1928 and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. These violins can be plugged into effect units, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> electric guitar, including distortion, wah-wah pedal and reverb. Since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings. For example, five-stringed electric violins are available from several manufacturers, and a seven string electric violin (with three lower strings encompassing the cello's range) is also available. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion (e.g., Jean-Luc Ponty) and popular music.|$|E
