5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new fractional currency notes were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue <b>end</b> <b>paper,</b> silk fibers, and watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of Ratcliff's career, he did plain bookbinding using leather from domestic sheep and calves. He decorated the covers with fashions of blind tooling typical of the time period. Later Englishman Ratcliff departed from the normal bookbinding practices and used higher quality and more sophisticated methods, including pasteboard covers instead of wooden boards, and imported Morocco leather instead of domestic leather. He also used marbled <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> instead of plain <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> and did gold tooling instead of blind tooling. The work of typical American colonial bookbinders was crude when compared to Ratcliff's.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two parts}} to a perm: the {{physical}} action of wrapping the hair, and the chemical phase. Both of these {{can affect the}} result. Important physical variables involved are what type of rod is used, how the hair is wrapped and how <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> are used. The two most common types of rods are straight and concave; each giving a different curl effect. The wrapping method is either spiral or croquinole, and various types and the positioning of <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> {{can be used with}} any combination of the above. Generally, smaller rods will produce smaller, tighter curls and increase the appearance of shortening the hair.|$|R

50|$|On {{the inside}} of the cover page, {{extending}} to the facing page is the front endpaper sometimes referred as FEP. The free half of the <b>end</b> <b>paper</b> is called a flyleaf. Traditionally, in hand-bound books, the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book. In modern publishing it can be either plain, as in many text-oriented books, or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as picture books, other children's literature, some arts and craft and hobbyist books, novelty/gift-market and coffee table books, and graphic novels. These books have an audience and traditions of their own where the graphic design and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important.The spine is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a bookshelf. It is customary for it to have printed text on it. In texts published and/or printed in the United States and the United Kingdom, the spine text, when vertical, runs from the top to the bottom, such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top. In books from continental Europe, vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up, though this convention has been changing lately. The spine usually contains all, or some, of four elements (besides decoration, if any), and in the following order: (1) author, editor, or compiler; (2) title; (3) publisher; and (4) publisher logo.|$|E
5000|$|Two other novelists {{should be}} mentioned, for they, like Fielding and Richardson, were in dialog through their works. Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett held a {{personal}} dislike for one another, and their works similarly offered up oppositional {{views of the}} self in society and the method of the novel. Laurence Sterne was a clergyman, and he consciously set out to imitate Jonathan Swift with his Tristram Shandy (1759-1767). The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, gentleman was a stylistic and formal revolution for the novel. Like Swift's satires, it begins with radical skepticism {{and a willingness to}} break apart figurative language and commonplace assumptions. The novel in three books is virtually all narrative voice, with a few interpolated narratives, such as [...] "Slawkenbergius's Tale." [...] Tristram seeks to write his autobiography, but like Swift's narrator in A Tale of a Tub, he worries that nothing in his life can be understood without understanding its context. For example, he tells the reader that at the very moment he was conceived, his mother was saying, [...] "Did you wind the clock?" [...] To explain how he knows this, he explains that his father took care of winding the clock and [...] "other family business" [...] on one day a month. To explain why the clock had to be wound then, he has to explain his father. To explain his father, he must explain a habit of his uncle's (referred to as [...] "My Uncle Toby"), and that requires knowing what his uncle did during the War of the Spanish Succession at the Battle of Namur. In other words, the biography moves backward rather than forward in time, only to then jump forward years, hit another knot, and move backward again. Further, Sterne provides [...] "plot diagrams" [...] for his readers that look like a ball of yarn. When a character dies, the next page of the book is black, in mourning. At one point, there is an <b>end</b> <b>paper</b> inserted into the text as a false ending to the book. It is a novel of exceptional energy, of multi-layered digressions, of multiple satires, and of frequent parodies. It was so experimental that Samuel Johnson later famously used it {{as an example of a}} fad when he said that nothing novel can sustain itself, for [...] "Tristram Shandy did not last." ...|$|E

Although we are not told of Tom's {{suggestion}} for a key, the message can be intuitively decoded and the code's key can then be identified as being [...] "Tom's a-cold", representing his isolation and loneliness. This is itself a quote from King Lear (Act III, Scene iv) and is a phrase which appears elsewhere in the book during shift sequences. The message in the <b>end</b> <b>papers</b> should be decoded using the key sequence [...] "TOMSACOLD".|$|R
