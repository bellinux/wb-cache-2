The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Screw Down System (SDS) is {{a typical}} <b>hydraulic</b> servo <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> It is the key {{actuator}} of cold rolling mill. The dynamic performance of SDS has {{a significant effect on}} the accuracy of thickness. <b>Hydraulic</b> servo <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is not always optimal and stable due to highly nonlinear and parameter uncertainties. In this paper, the most important nonlinear relating flow and pressure is analyzed. A nonlinear self-adaptive compensation method is designed. Modeling and simulating the <b>hydraulic</b> servo <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of SDS using this method, the numerical simulation results show that the maximum overshoot and static error of the compensated system are more less than that of without nonlinear compensation. The overshoot of the compensated system is less than 10 % when the cold strip is rolling. So the thickness tolerance of the cold strip can be guaranteed easily. This self- adaptive compensation method can be used to other <b>hydraulic</b> servo <b>control</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

The novel <b>hydraulic</b> pitch <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is driven by a novel high efficiency and high response hydraulic servo system. The pitch controller, designed by two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) motion control with feedback linearization, is developed to enhance the controllability and stability of the pitch <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, the full-scale testbed of the <b>hydraulic</b> pitch <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of a large wind turbine is developed for practically experimental verification.

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} use {{a mechanical}} clutch to transmit torque, {{rather than a}} torque converter, thus avoiding {{the primary source of}} loss in an automatic transmission. Manual transmissions also avoid the power requirement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> by relying on the human muscle power of the vehicle operator to disengage the clutch and actuate the gear levers, and the mental power of the operator to make appropriate gear ratio selections. Thus the manual transmission requires very little engine power to function, with the main power consumption due to drag from the gear train being immersed in the lubricating oil of the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{hydraulic}} {{automatic transmissions}} were almost always less energy efficient than manual transmissions due mainly to viscous and pumping losses, {{both in the}} torque converter and the hydraulic actuators. 21% is the loss on a 3 speed Chrysler Torqueflite compared to a modern GM 6L80 automatic. A relatively small amount of energy is required to pressurise the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which uses fluid pressure to determine the correct shifting patterns and operate the various automatic clutch mechanisms. However, with technological developments some modern Continuously variable transmission are more fuel efficient than their manual counterparts and modern 8-speed automatics are within 5% as efficient as a manual gearbox.|$|E
