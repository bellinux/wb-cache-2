40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} of UMTS radio networks is involved {{due to the}} specifics of W-CDMA technology. A common approach is Monte-Carlo simulation, which is computationally expensive. For purposes such as network planning and optimization, {{it is vital to}} obtain estimates efficiently. While an entirely analytical and very efficient method using expected coupling systems is known for <b>cell</b> powers, no <b>equivalent</b> for <b>cell’s</b> blocking <b>rates</b> is at hand. This work contributes a highly efficient scheme for estimating blocking rates. We introduce a simple knapsack model for the cell’s capacity, that relies on using fixed estimates for inter-cell interference. The event of blocking and the blocking rate can then be characterized and estimated. We demonstrate on the basis of realistic planning data that the method works efficiently and yields estimates that are sufficiently accurate for applications such as network optimization...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{enforcement}} of source parameters in ATM networks. An algorithm for monitoring the <b>cell</b> <b>rate</b> of a connection is the so-called generic <b>cell</b> <b>rate</b> algorithm.

Larvae were subjected to three different treatments: 1. 10 <b>equivalent</b> <b>cells</b> (Isochrysis galbana, Pavlova lutheri and Chaetoceros calcitrans) plus 20 <b>equivalent</b> <b>cells</b> of Tetraselmis suecica; 2. 80 <b>equivalent</b> <b>cells</b> of I. galbana and 3. starvation during eight days, and then individuals were re-fed on diet 1.

However, three days after re-feeding all larvae died, suggesting that the “point of no return” was exceeded. In spite of the large size of S. marginatus eggs and the great amount of stored reserves, the larvae need to feed on microalgae to undergo metamorphosis. Non-methyle-interrupted dienoic fatty acids and their precursors 16 : 1 n- 7 and 18 : 1 n- 9 are of great importance in starved larvae.
