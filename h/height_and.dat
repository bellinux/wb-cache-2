5|$|Situated between Somerset Road and Devonshire Road, Group 2 Architects {{designed}} the PUB Building as an H-shaped block {{with a central}} service core and a naturally-ventilated lobby. Facing north and south, the two parallel wings are of unequal <b>height,</b> <b>and</b> are linked by a wider transverse area three floors in <b>height,</b> <b>and</b> further up by the lift shaft and the access to each floor. Between the two wings is a landscaped courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The project {{lowered the}} height of the castle considerably, {{destroying}} much of the fortification in the process. The upper storeys of the keep, the towers, the covered passageways and the gatehouse were all demolished, along with some of the buildings in the inner ward. The resulting rubble was used to backfill the outer ward, raising its <b>height</b> <b>and</b> effectively turning the inner ward into a dry moat. The inner curtain wall was reduced to one storey in <b>height,</b> <b>and</b> the outer curtain wall was refaced. An esplanade and wall-walk were built around the remaining outer walls, which supported at least eight gun emplacements.|$|E
40|$|CIVINSApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedObserved distributions of wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> periods taken from {{one year of}} surface wave monitoring near Martha's Vineyard are compared to distributions based on narrow-band theory. The joint distributions of wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> periods <b>and</b> the marginal <b>height</b> distributions are examined. The observed significant wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> periods of the extreme waves are also studied. Seas are classified by the shapes of their power density spectra. Spectra with a single peak are designated as unimodal and spectra with two peaks as bimodal. Seas are further classified by spectral width, {{a function of the}} thee lowest spectral moments. The joint distributions of wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> periods from seas with narrow spectral widths take the general shape predicted by narrow-band theory and the statistics of extreme waves for these seas are well described. As spectral width increases, agreement between the theoretical and observed distributions diminishes and the significant wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> statistics of extreme waves show increasingly variability. Bimodal seas with wide-banded spectra are found to have larger significant <b>and</b> extreme wave <b>heights</b> <b>and</b> shorter extreme wave periods than unimodal seas of the same width. Theses.
