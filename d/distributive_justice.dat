40|$|This paper aims to {{elucidate}} {{the relationship of}} <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> on affective commitment through conflict management styles and examine the mediating effect of conflict management styles between <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> and affective commitment. Self-administered questionnaires were delivered to 330 respondents throughout Northern Malaysia. Next, the {{data were analyzed using}} statistical analysis of SPSS and Partial Least Squares of Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> was positively related to integrating, obliging and compromising styles while negatively related to dominating style but not related to avoiding style. It also revealed that integrating, obliging and compromising styles were positively significant with affective commitment while dominating style was negatively significant with affective commitment but avoiding style does not relate with affective commitment. In conclusion, the results also showed conflict management styles fully mediate the relationship between <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> and affective commitment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} if perceived pay <b>justice</b> (procedural and <b>distributive)</b> is predicted by personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, consciousness, emotional stability and open to experience) beyond the effects of individual background factors. The main results {{of the present study}}, which included 115 participants, showed that the Big-five personality traits did not predict procedural or <b>distributive</b> pay <b>justice</b> beyond the effects of individual background factors. Incomebefore taxes was the only background factor (positively) related to procedural and <b>distributive</b> pay <b>justice.</b> This indicates that personality is of less importance when it comes to perceived pay justice while the background factor income before taxes is of greater importance...|$|R

25|$|Perceptions of {{injustice}} and unfairness are significant antecedents and determinants of turnover intention (DeConinck & Stilwell, 2004; Nadiri & Tanova, 2010). In other words, turnover intention {{is a considerable}} outcome of an employee's fairness perceptions. Although all three dimensions of organizational justice {{may play a role}} in an employee’s intention to exit an organization, interactional and <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> are more predictive of turnover intention than procedural justice (Thomas & Nagalingappa, 2012).|$|E
25|$|In Rawls' philosophy, the {{original}} position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. While in {{the original}} position, persons {{are said to be}} behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} service failure through the model of service recovery evaluation. The study focuses {{on the concept of}} justice theory to determine the influence of emotions on the three dimensions of <b>justice</b> (<b>distributive,</b> procedural, and interactional) for consumer satisfaction. The study considered a sample of 102 retailers in the Yogyakarta region in Indonesia, whose customers had experienced service failure and received service recovery. This study hypothesizes that perceived justice will significantly affect customer satisfact ion directly in the context of service recovery satisfaction. It is further hypothesized {{that there will be a}} significant indirect effect of perceived justice on customer satisfaction in the context of service recovery satisfaction through emotions. This study employs the hierarchical regression model and shows that perceived <b>justice</b> (<b>distributive,</b> procedural, and interactional) significantly and directly affects customer satisfaction. Further findings indicate that perceived justice also significantly and indirectly affects customer satisfaction. Positive emotions influence the effect of perceived justice on customer satisfaction. Negative emotions only mediate between perceived procedural justice and satisfaction. Thus, negative emotions do not elicit perceived <b>distributive</b> and interactional <b>justice</b> to unsatisfied retailer as consumers. The mediating variables are only partial mediations. The findings hold significant implications for the theory and practice of service recovery management, especially for retailers and service providers...|$|R
40|$|PublisherTokyoArticlesThis paper {{argues that}} the {{arguments}} for workplace democracy put forth by Dahl and Young are incomplete as they do not provide <b>distributive</b> principles of <b>justice</b> that can tell us how we should distribute the benefits and burdens of adopting workplace democracy among citizens. Dahl and Young hold that justice requires us to respect citizens' equal moral freedom to pursue their own ends. And on these grounds, they call for workplace democracy {{so that we can}} respect citizens' equal moral freedom in the workplace. However, although introducing workplace democracy out of our concern for justice would enable us to respect some citizens' moral freedom, I argue that it could prevent us from respecting other citizens' moral freedom; this is because some citizens may prefer the goods of undemocratic practices in workplaces. If this is the case, in order to respect the equal moral freedom of all citizens, we need to identify reasonable methods {{and the extent to which}} we should adopt workplace democracy by defining reasonable trade-offs between the goods of democratic and undemocratic workplace practices. Given this analysis, I further argue that such identification can be given by <b>distributive</b> principles of <b>justice,</b> and the arguments for workplace democracy need to be supplemented by the arguments for <b>distributive</b> principles of <b>justice</b> for workplace democracy...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of justice in {{protected}} areas governance. The paper argues that protected areas governance faces a need to justify itself for the involved and affected interest groups in order to guarantee its legitimacy and effectiveness. The legitimacy of governance solutions is argued to rest on both <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice.</b> On one hand, the distribution of beneficial and adverse consequences of protected areas governance must be justifiable and justified. On the other hand, decision-making regarding protected areas has to satisfy expectations regarding procedural justice. The paper exemplifies these arguments by analysing the experiences in implementing the European Union's Habitats Directive. The paper demonstrates how the {{lack of attention to}} <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> has resulted in conflicts which have delayed the implementation of the directive and have undermined its effectiveness...|$|R

[...] State and trait level negative affect are negatively associated with interactional, procedural, and <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> perceptions. [...] Conversely, positive state and trait affectivity was linked to higher ratings of interactional, procedural and <b>distributive</b> <b>justice.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} {{organizational}} justice perceptions on performance {{is believed to}} stem from equity theory. This would suggest that when people perceive injustice they seek to restore justice. One way that employees restore justice is by altering their level of job performance. [...] Procedural justice affects performance {{as a result of}} its impact on employee attitudes. <b>Distributive</b> <b>justice</b> affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001).

2500|$|Absenteeism, or non-attendance, {{is another}} outcome of {{perceived}} injustice related to equity theory (Johns, 2001).

[...] Johns (2001) found that when people saw both their commitment to the organization and the organization's commitment to them as high, absenteeism is diminished. [...] Additionally, withdrawal, or leaving the organization, is a more extreme outcome stemming from the same equity theory principles.

2500|$|Another {{model of}} {{organizational}} justice proposed by Byrne (1999) and colleagues (Byrne & Cropanzano, 2000) [...] suggested that organizational justice is a multi-foci construct, one where employees see justice as {{coming from a}} source - either the organization or their supervisor. Thus, rather than focus on justice as {{the three or four}} factor component model, Byrne suggested that employees personify the organization and they distinguish between whether they feel the organization or supervisor have treated them fairly (interactional), use fair procedures (procedural), or allocate rewards or assignments fairly (<b>distributive</b> <b>justice).</b> A number of researchers used this model exploring the possibility that justice is more than just 3 or 4 factors (e.g., Karriker & Williams, 2009).|$|E

2500|$|Organizational {{citizenship}} {{behaviors are}} actions that employees take {{to support the}} organization that go {{above and beyond the}} scope of their job description. [...] OCBs are related to both procedural justice (DeConick, 2010; Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001; Karriker & Williams, 2009) and <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> perceptions (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001; Karriker & Williams, 2009). [...] As organizational actions and decisions are perceived as more just, employees are {{more likely to engage in}} OCBs. [...] Karriker and Williams (2009) established that OCBs are directed toward either the supervisor or the organization depending on whether the perception of just stems from the supervisor or the organization.

The concept of justice, with particular reference to procedural, <b>distributive</b> and interactional <b>justice,</b> {{is used as a}} guide in assessing employee perceptions of fairness of the organisations’ performance management system. A qualitative approach was used to gain an in-depth understanding of employee perceptions of fairness based on their personal experiences of the organisation’s performance management system. Data was obtained through extensive semi structured interviews with 20 employees who had been with the organisation and participated in the performance management system for 5 or more years.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been devoted to documenting the experiences of children involved in the dependency division of the juvenile justice system (i. e., the child protection system). Such insight is critical to inform policies that profoundly affect children and families. However, the experiences of another population involved in the dependency system are equally important—namely those of the children’s parents. Their understanding and perceptions have enormous potential to affect not only their behaviors, but the decisions rendered during the case and its eventual outcome. The current study systematically examined parents’ understanding and attitudes toward the dependency system and predictors of understanding and attitudes. The study also examined how understanding related to attitudes. The study drew from distributive (fairness of legal decisions) and procedural (fairness of legal procedures) justice frameworks to identify factors that may be particularly important for parents’ satisfaction with judicial decisions and overall perceptions of the court. One hundred and five parents (79 % mothers) involved in ongoing dependency cases completed an interview at the courthouse following their hearing. Questions about understanding asked parents to define commonly used dependency terms, to answer questions about a hypothetical dependency case, and to answer specific questions about their case. Questions about attitudes asked parents to rate their feelings about dependency professionals, the dependency court, and components of <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice.</b> Findings revealed a lack of comprehensive understanding of the system, both generally and with regard to specific details of parents’ cases, particularly for African American parents. On average, parents felt somewhat satisfied about the system. Parents with greater understanding had more positive attitudes about procedural justice, but more negative attitudes about judicial decisions and the court, the latter potentially due, in part, to a lack of empowerment in meeting the demands of dependency cases. <b>Distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> played a role in moderating the relations between understanding and attitudes such that parents with greater understanding felt particularly dissatisfied with the judge’s decisions and the court when <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> were low, respectively. Implications for parents’ dependency understanding and perceptions about <b>distributive</b> and procedural <b>justice</b> are discussed...|$|R

Many people have studied how satisfaction affects extra-role behavior or Organizational Citizenship Behavior and therefore I wanted to look at other items such as organizational justice, trust in supervisor and organizational commitment.

2500|$|Hayek {{disapproved of}} the notion of 'social justice'. [...] He {{compared}} the market to a game in which 'there is no point in calling the outcome just or unjust' and argued that 'social justice is an empty phrase with no determinable content'; likewise [...] "the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question as to whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just has no meaning". He generally regarded government redistribution of income or capital as an unacceptable intrusion upon individual freedom: [...] "the principle of <b>distributive</b> <b>justice,</b> once introduced, would not be fulfilled until the whole of society was organized in accordance with it. This would produce a kind of society which in all essential respects would be the opposite of a free society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{different}} {{models have been}} proposed to explain the structure of organizational justice perceptions including a two factor model, a three factor model, and a four factor model. [...] Many researchers have studied organizational justice {{in terms of the}} three factor model (e.g., DeConinck, 2010; Liljegren & Ekberg, 2010) while others have used a two factor model in which interpersonal justice is subsumed under procedural justice while yet some other studies suggest a four factor model best fits the data (Colquitt, 2001). [...] Greenberg (1990) proposed a two-factor model and Sweeney and McFarlin (1993) found support for a two-factor model composed of distributive and procedural justice. [...] Through the use of structural equation modeling, Sweeney and McFarlin found that <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> was related to outcomes that are person-level (e.g., pay satisfaction) while procedural justice was related to organization-level outcomes (e.g., organizational commitment).|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the two-factor model was challenged by studies that suggested a third factor (interactional justice) may be involved. [...] Bies and Moag (1986) argue that interactional justice is distinct from procedural justice because it represents the social exchange component of the interaction {{and the quality of}} treatment whereas procedural justice represents the processes that were used to arrive at the decision outcomes. [...] Generally researchers are in agreement regarding the distinction between procedural and <b>distributive</b> <b>justice</b> but there is more controversy over the distinction between interactional and procedural justice (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] Colquitt (2001) demonstrated that a four-factor model (including procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice) fit the data significantly better than a two or three factor model. [...] Colquitt's construct validation study also showed that each of the four components have predictive validity for different key organizational outcomes (e.g., commitment and rule compliance).|$|E

40|$|Departing {{from the}} {{welfarist}} tradition, recent theories of justice focus on individual opportunities as the appropriate standard for <b>distributive</b> judgments. <b>Justice</b> {{is seen as}} requiring equality of opportunity, instead of outcomes, among the individuals. To explore how this philosophical conception can be translated into concrete public policy, we select the in-come as relevant outcome and the income tax as the relevant redistributive policy, and we address the following questions: (i) what is the degree of opportunity inequality in an income distribution? (ii) how to design an opportunity egalitarian income tax policy? Both positive and normative criteria for ranking income distributions {{on the basis of}} equality of oppor-tunities are derived. Moreover, we characterize an opportunity egalitarian income tax policy and we formulate criteria for choosing among alternative tax systems. ...|$|R
