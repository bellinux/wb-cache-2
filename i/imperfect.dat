5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as <b>imperfect.</b> A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An <b>imperfect</b> duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an <b>imperfect</b> duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than <b>imperfect</b> duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Urnula craterium allows for both an <b>imperfect</b> (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often {{happened}} in fungal taxonomy, the <b>imperfect</b> form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and <b>imperfect</b> forms of the same species was not then known. The <b>imperfect</b> stage of Urnula craterium is the plant pathogenic species Conoplea globosa, known to cause a canker disease (Strumella canker) of oak and several other hardwoods.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomical {{history of}} this fungus has been {{complicated}} by the fact that its life cycle allows for both an <b>imperfect</b> (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; at various times authors have assigned names to one or the other form, but these names have often been at odds with the accepted rules of fungal nomenclature. It was originally described in 1781 by the Dutch scientist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin as Lichen sarcoides. Christian Hendrik Persoon called it Peziza sarcoides in 1801. Elias Magnus Fries, in his 1822 publication Systema Mycologicum, described the <b>imperfect</b> state of the fungus under the name Tremella sarcoides. The genus name Coryne was first used in 1851 by Bonorden, who proposed Coryne sarcoides for the <b>imperfect</b> state; in 1865 the Tulasne brothers (Charles and Louis René) used Coryne to refer to both the perfect and <b>imperfect</b> forms. It was designated the type species for the genus in a 1931 publication by Clements and Shear.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so <b>imperfect</b> ever {{announced}} {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so <b>imperfect</b> a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E

5|$|Pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) can be {{triggered}} by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely barometric changes and ionizing radiation. Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an <b>imperfect</b> seal.|$|E
5|$|Some mimicry is <b>imperfect.</b> Natural {{selection}} drives mimicry only {{far enough}} to deceive predators. For example, when predators avoid a mimic that imperfectly resembles a coral snake, the mimic is sufficiently protected.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Imperfect</b> {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The <b>Imperfect</b> can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
