Results from the most recent round (1992 - 1996) of the Coal Worker's X-ray Surveillance Programs indicate that approximately 8 % of the examined miners who had at least 25 years of mining experience were diagnosed with Coal Worker Pneumoconiosis (CWP) (category 1 / 0 +). During the period between 1995 - 1999, mine operators and MSHA inspectors collected 9968 and 1365 dust samples respectively, from longwall <b>designated</b> <b>occupation</b> (DO) personnel. Analysis of these samples showed that 1970 (20 %) of the mine operator samples and 25. 8 (19 %) of the MSHA samples 5 exceeded the 2 mg/m 3 dust standard. The continued development of CWP in coal mine workers and the magnitude of respirable dust over-exposures in longwall mining occupations illustrate the need for improved dust control technology on longwalls. Figure 1 illustrates the major longwall dust sources as determined in the early 1990 's. 4 This article describes the ongoing research to find ways to minimise shearer dust levels as a function of changes in dust control parameters, and research to determine the impact of high air velocities on shield dust entrainment...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{gives an}} {{historical}} account of agent noun formations in ‑mon‑ in Old and Middle Irish, {{based on the}} Proto-Indo-European prehistory of this suffix. The patterning of agent nouns in ‑mon‑ in Irish points to a polysemy already inherited from the originally adjectival Proto-Indo-European derivates denoting affiliation. This is supported also by polysemous nominalizations in Ancient Greek. Formations in ‑mon‑, originally deverbal in Proto-Indo-European, came to be formally enlarged and functionally reinterpreted in Early Celtic, thus leading to the polysemy in Irish, with both deverbal and denominal ‑mon‑formations <b>designating</b> professions, <b>occupations</b> and functions as well as instruments and even animal...|$|R

50|$|Cultural stereotypes, {{which can}} dictate {{specific}} roles, are engrained in {{both men and}} women and these stereotypes are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are <b>designated</b> to <b>occupations</b> which require such skills. While these skills are culturally valued, they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued. Men have traditionally been viewed as the breadwinner or the worker, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.|$|R

40|$|This {{conference on}} {{workplace}} safety {{was a success}} for both the Gambians who attended and the Americans involved in planning, implementing, and funding the conference. The Americans were delighted to bring about some understanding of worker safety to {{a country that has}} struggled with labor issues for centuries. The dialogue reflected the concern that stakeholders in both countries have for labor issues, but there is a tremendous need for ongoing partnership with industrialized countries to bring these ideas and strategies to fruition. The Gambia has received some assistance in the area of economic development, but not in improving workplace safety. A wide range of economic support activities have been initiated by the ILO in The Gambia during the past 20 years. This has included providing guidance with international labor standards, assistance to the development of labor and related services, support to employer and worker organizations, vocational training, job creation and employment policy, and small enterprise development. Many challenges lie ahead for The Gambia in improving workplace safety. Serious concerns remain related to minimum safeguards in the workplace. For example, the Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide for employees working in <b>designated</b> <b>occupations,</b> but these are rarely offered (Culp et al., 2003). Workers are plentiful and jobs are not, so workers tend to take any employment they can without regard to working conditions. The government has not formally revoked employers who have contributed to worker deaths. Industrial inspections are conducted, although there is little consequence for violations. The cycle of poverty, younger workers, and lack of education also contribute to many worker safety issues. Farm workers cannot read instructions on pesticide containers and industrial employees cannot understand workplace hazard communications. While the Gambian constitution mandates free compulsory primary education, the current state of educational opportunities is so dismal for poor families that many will not go beyond primary school and will enter the work force without technical skills. Teachers are overworked. While some young people could develop small business enterprises related to tourism and woodcarving, the vast majority continue a downward spiral into poverty (McGrath 2 ̆ 6 King, 1999) ...|$|R

5000|$|Since 1933 Germany {{had been}} a one-party state, but {{following}} {{the end of the war}} in May 1945, with Nazi-ism defeated and Germany under foreign occupation, a return to multi-party democracy seemed to be the way ahead for many people. In July 1945 Gerhard Rohner was one of the founders of the new Christian Democratic Union (CDU party) in Dresden which, along with the entire central portion of what had been Germany, now found itself under Soviet Military Administration in what was now <b>designated</b> the Soviet <b>Occupation</b> Zone.

5000|$|In May 1945 World War II {{ended and}} with it the Hitler regime fell. In Germany {{political}} parties and organisations that had been banned under the Nazis were banned no longer, and on 10 May 1945 the main Sorbian organization, Domowina, was reinstated just five days after the end of hostilities in this part of Germany. Maria Schneider joined Domowina that same year. In 1948 she joined the Trades Union Federation (FDGB / Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund [...] ) of what was at this point still <b>designated</b> the Soviet <b>occupation</b> zone. Although the German Democratic Republic was founded as a stand-alone Soviet sponsored state only in October 1949, the basis for a return to one-party government had already been created Soviet administration in April 1946, with the contentious merger of the old Communist Party with the Moderate-left SPD. In 1948 Maria Schneider joined what would become the new country's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands).

5000|$|Early in 1946 Kretschmann {{joined the}} Communist Party. [...] His {{part of what}} had been Germany was now <b>designated</b> the Soviet <b>occupation</b> zone. In April 1946, across the entire zone, the {{contentious}} merger of the KPD and more moderately left-wing SPD prepared the ground for a return to one-party rule. Kretschmann was one of many former communists who lost little time in signing their membership across to the resulting Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands), although the focus of his future career would lie outside mainstream politics. In October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone was superseded by the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Forty years later, in November 1989, protestors beached the Berlin Wall and it became apparent that the Soviet army had no instructions to apply force to crushing the rising tide of anti-government discontent in East Germany. A succession of political developments took place culminating with German reunification, formally in October 1990. Through this time and beyond it Kretschmann's political loyalty stood firm. When the old East German SED (party) sought to reinvent itself for a multi-party future as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) Kretschmann stayed with it. He died just four days after the PDS in turn had dissolved itself {{to be replaced by a}} [...] "new" [...] party, [...] "The Left" [...] ("Die Linke").|$|R

In April 1946, following the contentious merger that created what would become the occupation zone's ruling SED (party), he was one of many thousand Communist Party members who lost no time in signing their memberships across to the new party. The SED was formed by merging the German Communist Party and, within the occupation zone, the more moderate Social Democratic party: in the first couple of years the authorities took care to present a semblance of parity between former members of the two constituent elements of the SED. In 1947 Lindau was appointed co-director of the new party's newly established [...] "Karl Marx" [...] Party Academy. His fellow co-director was a former SPD man called Paul Lenzner (1884-1955). In September or October 1950 both Rudolf Lindau and Paul Lenzner were removed from the Party Academy directorship, {{to be replaced by a}} single director, [...] By this time the Soviet administered occupation zone had been reinvented, formally in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and the Occupy Movement (OM) {{writ large}} generated {{new forms of}} rhetorical invention through its emergence in geographical places and virtual spaces across the world. The genesis and development of Occupy on these “radical” grounds provide an empirical grounding to theory on the chora, rhetorical invention, and the vernacular, where the word occupy and the tactic <b>occupation</b> <b>designate</b> vital sites (topoi) of rhetorical activity: seats/sources of local meaning(s) that occupiers used to bring new lines of thought to life. The radical uptake of “occupy” would create what Edward Schiappa calls a definitional rupture: a disruption of the “natural attitude” around the meaning or usage of a word. To suture this gap, I acknowledge the ethical and normative ramifications that accompany the act of definition as a political act and then conduct a philological analysis on ‘occupy’ and ‘occupation’ by tracing these words to their earliest or “radical” roots. I then attend {{to the emergence of}} OWS in the place of Zuccotti Park/Liberty Plaza, followed by its first call to action and popular uptake in virtual streams and media, where both places produced new vernacular modalities and media. In gesturing to the disaster sociology literature on emergent citizen groups (ECGS) and emergent phenomena, this assembly of Occupy in time, place, and space, radically reconceives ‘what it means’ to “occupy” common places and spaces towards the creation of new socio-economic realities in response to crisis...|$|R

The entire Soviet zone would be reformed as the German Democratic Republic, formally founded only in October 1949, but already in April 1946 the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD created the precondition for a return to one-party rule.
