The aim {{of the study was to}} compare PRP to WBV on functional capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD. Twenty individuals with COPD were assigned to PRP and WBV, who were evaluated regarding their lung function, functional capacity and quality of life through spirometry, 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT) and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), respectively. The main results for the WBV group were, there were improvements in the walked distance on the 6 MWT and in the symptoms and <b>total</b> <b>domains</b> of the SGRQ.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of dislocations confined to grain boundaries in a striped system are studied using electroconvection in the nematic liquid crystal N 4. In electroconvection, a striped pattern of convection rolls forms for sufficiently high driving voltages. We {{consider the case}} of a rapid change in the voltage that takes the system from a uniform state to a state consisting of striped domains with two different wavevectors. The domains are separated by domain walls along one axis and a grain boundary of dislocations in the perpendicular direction. The pattern evolves through dislocation motion parallel to the domain walls. We report on features of the dislocation dynamics. The kinetics of the domain motion are quantified using three measures: dislocation density, average domain wall length, and the <b>total</b> <b>domain</b> wall length per area. All three quantities exhibit behavior consistent with power law evolution in time, with the defect density decaying as $t^{- 1 / 3 }$, the average domain wall length growing as $t^{ 1 / 3 }$, and the <b>total</b> <b>domain</b> wall length decaying as $t^{- 1 / 5 }$. The two different exponents are indicative of the anisotropic growth of domains in the system. Comment: 8 figures: 7 jpeg and 1 pd...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a hybrid, finite element/boundary element method {{which can be}} used to solve for {{particle}} diffusion in semi-infinite domains containing geometric obstructions and a variable advective field is presented. In previous work either boundary element or finite element/difference methods were used to solve for particle concentrations in an advective domain. These methods of solution had a number of limitations. Due to limitations in computing spatially dependent Green`s functions, the boundary element method of solution was limited to domains containing only constant advective fields, and due to its inherent formulation, finite element/difference methods were limited to only domains of finite spatial extent. Thus, where the finite element solution was limited, the boundary element solution was not, and where the boundary element solution was limited, the finite element solution was not. In this paper it is proposed to split the <b>total</b> <b>domain</b> into two sub-domains where each method of solution is applicable. For each of these sub-domains, the appropriate solution method is used; thereby, producing a general method of solution for the <b>total</b> semi-infinite <b>domain...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the generalizability of trial results by comparing randomized patients to eligible but nonrandomized patients who received the same management. Implementation of trial results is only justifiable when {{the results can be}} generalized to the <b>total</b> <b>domain</b> population. The design was a multicentre randomized controlled trial on the effect of early screening and treatment with ventilation tubes on infants with otitis media with effusion. Randomized (n = 187) and nonrandomized eligible patients (n = 133) were followed up. The study population comprised children who were detected by auditory screening at the age of 9 - 12 months and who were subsequently diagnosed with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion for 4 - 6 months. A significant difference was found in the distribution of some prognostic factors: more randomized children had older siblings, did not attend day care and had mothers with a lower educational level than the nonrandomized children. These factors, however, did not modify the outcome. No differences were found in mean hearing levels between the randomized and nonrandomized children: in both the randomized and nonrandomized children ventilation tubes improved the hearing level, especially after 6 months. However, in the long term (12 months), the hearing levels were equal again. The results of the randomized and nonrandomized patients were comparable. The results of this trial appear to be generalizable to the <b>total</b> <b>domain</b> population. The procedure of following up both randomized and nonrandomized patients is recommended when there is concern about selective participation and reduced generalizability...|$|R

In this endeavour, exploring the structures and electronic properties associated with C bond formation in BNC which contains C-N or C-B bonds is an interesting topic that must be addressed before widespread synthetic applications.

Methods Survey items were piloted and refined following psychometric principles in five separate patient cohorts. Patient and expert endorsement of items, factor analyses, Spearman rank correlations and response distributions were employed for item selection. Formal {{reliability and validity}} evaluation were conducted for the final questionnaire items. Results Expert physicians and patient focus groups confirmed face and content validity for the measure. A 10 ‐item measure called the Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index (M‐ISI) was developed with two domains: a <b>Total</b> M‐ISI <b>Domain</b> consisting of subdomains for stress urinary incontinence, urgency urinary incontinence, and pad use, and a Bother Domain. High construct validity was demonstrated with a Cronbach's alpha for the <b>Total</b> M‐ISI <b>Domain</b> (items 1 ‐ 8) of 0. 90 and for the Bother Domain (items 9 ‐ 10) of 0. 82. Cronbach's alpha for the subdomains were all[*]>[*] 0. 85. Construct validity, convergent and divergent validity, internal discriminant validity, and predictive validity were all robust.

In-cloud temperature excess is weak as observed, whereas water vapour excess is significant and correlated with vertical velocity. However, buoyancy deviations are extremely small, indicating an equilibrium of density, involving thermodynamics and microphysics.

Moisture convective transports are extremely intense and complex to analyse. A decomposition into vertical and horizontal parts shows that horizontal exchanges are important, in particular to explain moistening at upper levels.

Guidelines to assist in selecting appropriate combinations of these factors are suggested. While the SEAWAT code has been tested {{for a wide range}} of problems, the sensitivity of results to spatial and temporal discretization levels and numerical schemes has not been studied in detail for unstable flow problems.
