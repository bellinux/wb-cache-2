5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E

Where other mainstream approaches discourage dialogue about subjective meaning and truth {{in an effort to}} maintain therapist objectivity and value-neutrality, ontological hermeneutics encourages authentic dialogue between therapist and client that co-creates meaningful, subjective truth to enrich the life of the client.

High social status in the world is visually represented through points so that users can immediately tell a new member of the community compared to a veteran user. High social status will gain entrance to VIP events, confer preferential access to personal spaces and allow for the acquisition of virtual goods not available to the average user.|$|E

25|$|To travel between worlds, the Old Ones used portals {{to another}} {{dimension}} ("warp gates"), which they {{built at the}} north and south poles of the Warhammer World. Eventually, however, these gates collapsed, allowing raw magical energy and the daemonic forces of Chaos to pour forth into the Warhammer world. At this point, the Old Ones disappeared. Before leaving however, they had established the Lizard men (ruled over by the Slann) as their servants. In addition they had created the races of Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, Ogres and Halflings. Orcs and Goblins were not created by the Old Ones, or part of their plan, and their origin is not made clear in the setting. Beastmen and Skaven were the result of mutation from raw magical energy at this time. Eventually the Chaos Daemons were driven back by Lizardmen and Elves, with the Elves performing a great ritual to drain out the raw magic that was flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> sustaining the Daemons. Some creatures, such as Dragons and Dragon-Ogres, are stated to have existed prior to the arrival of the Old Ones.|$|E

500|$|Brittany Vincent of GamesRadar {{found the}} story poignant, and IGN's Moriarty named {{it one of}} the game's {{standout}} features. GameSpot's VanOrd felt that the game's themes and dialogue positively contributed to the story, appreciating the use of humor, and GameTrailers called the writing [...] "top notch". Conversely, Joystiq's Sinan Kubba wrote that the story lacked the charm that the art style possessed, while Polygons Philip Kollar felt that the game's art style was the only motive to complete the story, which he felt was predictable. Some reviewers commented on the pacing of the story; Eurogamer's Welsh found that it was [...] "too slow to surprise or to develop its mysteries", while GamesRadar's Vincent found the pace believable. The game's side quests also received praise; GameTrailers felt that they provide insight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> Eurogamer's Welsh commended their variety, while Polygons Kollar conversely found them uninteresting and [...] "single-minded".|$|E

Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it.

500|$|Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV forms {{part of the}} [...] "Final Fantasy XV Universe", a {{multimedia}} project based around the 2016 video game Final Fantasy XV that also includes the theatrical CGI film : the story of XV was large enough to have covered several games, but as the team {{did not want to}} create any additional games, they decided to create additional media. While similar in style to the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII project, the media associated with Final Fantasy XV came before the game's release rather than after it, acting as insight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> characters. XV and its associated media likewise hold a thematic connection to Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a compilation of games and associated media sharing a common mythos while boasting unconnected stories and settings. While distanced from the brand for marketing purposes, the world of XV still uses its mythos and design elements. Brotherhood was designed so it would not be necessary for people to watch for understanding of the main game.|$|E
500|$|The {{world is}} created to be believable. Glukhovsky {{included}} numerous side {{stories in the}} game, and different kinds of dramas surrounding the game's four factions.

According to 4A, these choices are very subtle, {{so that they would}} not [...] "gamify" [...] the concept. It is a method carried out by 4A {{to create a sense of}} verisimilitude to the world, which will then make the decision more [...] "genuine". To achieve naturalism, Andrey Prokhorov, the game's creative director, intentionally removed most aspects of a typical head up display as they considered it a barrier preventing players from immersing themselves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> that having it would destroy the game's atmosphere. Prokhorov noted that adding numerous graphical and audio cues required additional time and effort, but he claimed that should they have sufficient time, the team may not make any head up display at all.|$|E
