By 1998 HIV infection had been reported from all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under control of the central government.

40|$|The {{importance}} of ART in preventing HIV trans-mission cannot be understated. It has significantly reduced {{the risk of}} <b>heterosexual</b> <b>transmissions</b> and transmission from mothers to children (3, 4), improved the quality of health of PHAs, reduced their AIDS-related mortality, and improved sexual functions (5). As a result, PHAs live longer and lead healthier, productive and sexually-active lives. These good effects of ART can augment the percep-tion that ART cures AIDS and/or reduces the in-fectivity of people on ART (6). PHAs may also face difficulty in adhering to a lifetime safe sex because of their desire to bear children (7, 8) and consider AIDS as a manageable chronic disease (9). These de-velopments could inadvertently lead to treatment optimism, risk compensation or behavioural dis-inhibition (10, 11), which has created the need for addressing HIV prevention by and among people who are infected.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{sequences}} in {{intravenous drug}} user (IDU) networks are highly homogenous even after several years, while this is not observed in most sexual epidemics. To address this disparity, we examined the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) evolutionary rate on the population level for IDU and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>transmissions.</b> All available HIV- 1 env V 3 sequences from IDU outbreaks and heterosexual epidemics with known sampling dates were collected from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Evolutionary rates were calculated using phylogenetic trees with a t test root optimization of dated samples. The evolutionary rate of HIV- 1 subtype A 1 {{was found to be}} 8. 4 times lower in fast spread among IDUs in the former Soviet Union (FSU) than in slow spread among heterosexual individuals in Africa. Mixed epidemics (IDU and heterosexual) showed intermediate evolutionary rates, indicating a combina-tion of fast- and slow-spread patterns. Hence, if transmissions occur repeatedly during the initial stage of host infection, before selective pressures of the immune system have much impact, the rate of HIV- 1 evolution on the population level will decrease. Conversely, in slow spread, where HIV- 1 evolves under the pressure of the immune system before a donor infects a recipient, the virus evolution at the population level will increase. Epidemiological modeling confirmed that the evolutionary rate of HIV- 1 depends on the rate of spread and predicted that the HIV- 1 evolutionary rate in a fast-spreading epidemic, e. g., for IDU...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} extent of late {{presentation}} for HIV care in Northern Greece during the period 2000 to 2010 and to explore correlations aiming to provide guidance for future interventions. Methods: HIV-positive patients with no prior history of HIV care at presentation and with a CD 4 T cell count within three months from the first confirmatory Western blot result were eligible for this study. Late presentation and advanced HIV disease were defined in concordance with the recommendations of the European Late Presenter Consensus working group. Time trends in presentation status and risk factors linked to late presentation and advanced HIV disease were identified in multivariable logistic regression models. Additional analyses after multiple imputation of missing values were performed to assess the robustness of our findings. Results: The status at presentation was evaluated for 631 eligible HIV-positive individuals. Overall, 52. 5 % (95 % CI: 48. 6 % to 56. 4 %) of patients presented late for HIV care and 31. 2 % (95 % CI: 27. 6 % to 34. 8 %) presented with advanced HIV disease. Time trends were consistent with an improvement in the presentation status {{of our study}} population (p&# 60; 0. 001). Risk factors associated with late presentation in multivariable logistic regression were intravenous drug use, <b>heterosexual</b> HIV <b>transmission,</b> immigrant status and age at diagnosis. Conclusions: Despite the trend for improvement, a significant proportion of newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients present late for care.

40|$|Background: HIV- 1 infections have {{increased}} significantly with a doubled {{number of cases}} identified between 2006 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009 in Fujian, a southeastern province of China. No study has investigated the cause and the evolving epidemic there. Methods: In a province-wide study of recently identified infections from 2006 to 2009, we sought to investigate the rising epidemic of HIV- 1 infections among general populations and conducted a molecular epidemiology study to determine the new trends of HIV- 1 evolution there. Results: About 915, 830 and 2, 152, 658 specimens collected in 2006 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009 were tested for HIV- 1 infection. We found that the overall prevalence of infections elevated from 0. 064 % in 2006 - 2007 to 0. 074 % in 2008 - 2009 (P = 0. 003). A high frequency of HIV- 1 infections was consistently related to unprotected <b>heterosexual</b> <b>transmissions</b> compared with other risk groups such as intravenous drug users. Critically, the prevalence rate had significantly increased in recent years among general populations such as voluntary blood donors (P < 0. 001), recipients of blood transfusion (P < 0. 001) and people during presurgery screening (P < 0. 001). Besides CRF 01 -AE as the major circulating subtype (61 / 86, 70. 9 %), 25 non-CRF 01 -AE strains were found contributing to increased HIV- 1 genetic diversity including C/CRF 07 -BC/CRF 08 -BC (5. 8 %), B/B' (15. 1 %), unique recombinant forms (8. 1 %), and some minor drug-resistant variants. Conclusions: Increased prevalence of HIV- 1 infections among general populations likely accounts for the rising epidemic {{in recent years in}} Fujian. The epidemic was no longer dictated by CRF 01 -AE but rather by multisubtype viruses.
