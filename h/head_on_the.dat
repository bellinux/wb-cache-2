5|$|Another catch {{went down}} off Miller {{late in the}} day when Compton, who had reached a century, edged him but Johnson dropped the catch at slip. Charlie Barnett then edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller {{completed}} a difficult catch. Compton then hit Miller for four, provoking the paceman's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and the next delivery slipped out of Miller's hand and cleared the batsman's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> full, provoking some jeering in the crowd. England reached stumps at 6/345, just one run ahead of the tourists, with Compton on 154.|$|E

5|$|At 3:21 of the 1st round, after Wanderlei flurried {{and missed}} a punch {{with his right}} hand, Jackson countered with a left hook on Silva's jaw, sending the latter on to the canvas and {{rendering}} him unconscious.

5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Rosey and The Hurricane (with Super Stacy) {{defeated}} The Heart Throbs (Antonio and Romeo) in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat.

After {{back and forth}} action, Carlito removed the padding {{from one of the}} turnbuckles. Benjamin then hit his <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exposed metal while performing a Stinger splash. Carlito pinned Benjamin with a roll-up, allowing Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} the warm front is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and he opens the window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles as he puts itself back together.|$|E
5|$|The Gilwell Farmhouse is {{believed}} to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined together. There is a brick well <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> farm that {{is known as the}} Gil Well. A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill, Chingford. The field was so-named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from the summit. It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest of the summit, from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. An alternative start begins at Pitt's <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> A4085 road.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks {{belonging}} to different geologic periods, dating {{as far back}} almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on Inishtrahull Island off the north coast of Inishowen and on the mainland at Annagh <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mullet Peninsula. The newer formations are the drumlins and glacial valleys {{as a result of}} the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.|$|E
5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have eyes that are notched, and a few have ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the <b>head</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field {{at the beginning of the}} game, if the Indians have runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of Banksia paludosa are {{endemic to}} New South Wales. The nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis {{through to the}} Sydney region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, with a separate population {{in the vicinity of}} Eden just north of the Victorian border. It occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in 1966 from Hat <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, but has not been found there since despite field work in the area. This record aside, the northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where it is now locally vanished. Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern Highlands.|$|E
