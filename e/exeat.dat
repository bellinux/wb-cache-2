In R v Foreign Secretary ex parte Everett, the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to, and the withholding of passports from, British citizens. The writ of ne <b>exeat</b> regno {{is also used to}} prevent a person leaving the country. The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power: under Blackstone's definition, a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch.|$|E
25|$|Carthusian Day is {{the main}} social event of the school calendar. It is held on day {{preceding}} the <b>Exeat</b> in CQ and Sunday dress is worn. The day is intended for the parents and families of Carthusians to visit the school. Speeches are made and Sports events played: including the annual Cricket and Golf matches between Carthusians and Old Carthusians. It also gives parents {{the chance to see}} their sons' and daughters' work (such as the traditional Archives project done by Fourths on old Carthusians killed in World War I).|$|E
500|$|Every weekday (except for Wednesday) {{begins with}} a chapel service. School is held on Saturday mornings, with many {{sporting}} fixtures taking place on Saturday afternoons. There is an <b>exeat</b> weekend every term when pupils get respite from Saturday school. The Sunday chapel service is compulsory for boarding pupils. Homework, which is always referred to as [...] "prep", (short for preparatory work) is set for every day {{with the exception of}} Sunday. During weekdays there is a mid-morning coffee break for all pupils when refreshments are provided, a tradition from when many day pupils would arrive at that time from outlying settlements. The school uniform is traditional, including a black blazer and a tie. Merits are given as rewards for outstanding work. Punishments include weekday afternoon detention and Saturday afternoon detention. Corporal punishment had to be phased out by 1987 in line with state schools, as it received public funding. The headmaster is aided in his running of the school by the monitor (prefect) system. As well as the standard subjects, Latin, Classics, Ancient History, Greek, German and Spanish are taught. The school has a strong reputation for sciences. In 2011 the Independent Schools Inspectorate described the school's ethos as [...] "traditionally unpretentious".|$|E
50|$|Huntley has 155 {{students}} in 5 squads {{named after the}} previous headmasters- Mather, Wilson, Rix-Trott, Strombom and Sherriff. They compete in various challenges such as Swimming Sports and Cross Country Running.

60|$|The {{gentle and}} {{intelligent}} reader will remember (though that miserable worm, the vapid and irreflective reader, will have forgotten) {{that at the}} beginning of the term the fags of Kay's had endeavoured to show their approval of Fenn and their disapproval of Kennedy by applying to the former for leave when they wished to go to the town; and that Fenn had received them in the most ungrateful manner with blows instead of <b>exeats.</b> Strong in this recollection, he was not disturbed by Kennedy's question. Indeed, it gave him a comfortable feeling of rectitude. There is nothing more pleasant than to be accused to your face of something which you can deny on the spot with an easy conscience. It is like getting a very loose ball at cricket. Fenn felt almost friendly towards Kennedy.|$|R
50|$|Many Boarding Schools have an on-campus school {{store or}} snack hall where {{additional}} food and school supplies can be purchased; {{and may also}} have a student recreational center where food can be purchased during specified hours.British boarding schools have three terms a year, approximately twelve weeks each, with a few days' half-term holiday during which {{students are expected to}} go home or at least away from school. There may be several <b>exeats,</b> or weekends, in each half of the term when students may go home or away (e.g. international students may stay with their appointed guardians, or with a host family). Boarding students nowadays often go to school within easy traveling distance of their homes, and so may see their families frequently; e.g. families are encouraged to come and support school sports teams playing at home against other schools, or for school performances in music, drama or theatre.|$|R

60|$|It is here worth observation, {{that these}} corrupt {{proceedings}} of the prince have, {{in the opinion of}} several learned men, given rise to two customs, which are a long time grown to have the force of laws. For, first the successors of this King, continuing the custom of seizing on the accruing rents in the vacancy of sees and abbeys, it grew in process of time to be exacted as a right, or acknowledgment to the King as founder; whence the revenues of vacant bishoprics belong at this day to the crown. The second custom had an original not unlike. Several persons, to avoid the persecutions of the King's informers, and other instruments of oppression, withdrew themselves and their effects to foreign countries; upon which the King issued a proclamation, forbidding all men to leave the kingdom without his licence; from whence, in the judgment of the same authors, the writ ne <b>exeat</b> regno had its beginning.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{accepted}} the explanation. If God had not cured him, {{it was because}} he did not really believe. And yet he did not see how he could believe more than he did. But perhaps he had not given God enough time. He had only asked Him for nineteen days. In a day or two he began his prayer again, and this time he fixed upon Easter. That was the day of His Son's glorious resurrection, and God in His happiness might be mercifully inclined. But now Philip added other means of attaining his desire: he began to wish, when he saw a new moon or a dappled horse, and he looked out for shooting stars; during <b>exeat</b> they had a chicken at the vicarage, and he broke the lucky bone with Aunt Louisa and wished again, each time that his foot might be made whole. He was appealing unconsciously to gods older to his race than the God of Israel. And he bombarded the Almighty with his prayer, at odd times of the day, whenever it occurred to him, in identical words always, for it seemed to him important to make his request in the same terms. But presently the feeling came to him that this time also his faith would not be great enough. He could not resist the doubt that assailed him. He made his own experience into a general rule.|$|E
60|$|Every man, however brief or inglorious {{may have}} been his academical career, must {{remember}} with kindness and tenderness the old university comrades and days. The young man's life is just beginning: the boy's leading-strings are cut, and {{he has all the}} novel delights and dignities of freedom. He has no idea of cares yet, or of bad health, or of roguery, or poverty, or to-morrow's disappointment. The play has not been acted so often as to make him tired. Though the after drink, as we mechanically go on repeating it, is stale and bitter, how pure and brilliant was that first sparkling draught of pleasure!--How the boy rushes at the cup, and with what a wild eagerness he drains it! But old epicures who are cut off from the delights of the table, and are restricted to a poached egg and a glass of water, like to see people with good appetites; and, as {{the next best thing to}} being amused at a pantomime one's-self is to see one's children enjoy it, I hope there may be no degree of age or experience to which mortal may attain, when he shall become such a glum philosopher as not to be pleased by the sight of happy youth. Coming back a few weeks since from a brief visit to the old University of Oxbridge, where my friend Mr. Arthur Pendennis passed some period of his life, I made the journey in the railroad by the side of a young fellow at present a student of Saint Boniface. He had got an <b>exeat</b> somehow, and was bent on a day's lark in London: he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close (which was a great deal too soon for me, for I never was tired of listening to the honest young fellow's jokes and cheery laughter); and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab, so that he might get into town the quicker, and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there. Away the young lad went whirling, with joy lighting up his honest face; and as for the reader's humble servant, having but a small carpet-bag, I got up on the outside of the omnibus, and sate there very contentedly between a Jew-pedlar smoking bad cigars, and a gentleman's servant taking care of a poodle-dog, until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes, when the coachman drove leisurely away. We weren't in a hurry to get to town. Neither one of us was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking Babylon, or thought of dining at the Club that night, or dancing at the Casino. Yet a few years more, and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager.|$|E
