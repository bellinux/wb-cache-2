50|$|<b>Design</b> <b>for</b> excellence, <b>Design</b> <b>for</b> Excellence, or <b>Design</b> <b>For</b> Excellence (DFX or DfX), are {{terms and}} {{expansions}} used interchangeably {{in the existing}} literature, where the X in <b>design</b> <b>for</b> X is a variable which can have one of many possible values. In many fields (e.g., very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and nanoelectronics) X may represent several traits or features including: manufacturability, power, variability, cost, yield, or reliability. This {{gives rise to the}} terms <b>design</b> <b>for</b> manufacturability (DfM, DFM), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> variability (DfV), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> cost (DfC).

5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed <b>designs</b> <b>for</b> the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
