25|$|A small {{fleet of}} Atlanteans also crossed the Atlantic, {{entering}} service in New York City. The double-deckers arrived in 1976, but proved problematic. After <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> the too-tall buses from the docks, {{it was discovered}} that their height made them unsuitable for use on Fifth Avenue, and due to an underdimensioned air-conditioning system they could not be operated in the height of summer. New York's heavily potholed roads also took a toll, and after the Atlanteans spent most of their time being repaired the fleet was quietly withdrawn in 1980.|$|E

25|$|The team's form {{began to}} slip, however, with a disappointing 1–1 home draw against Stoke City, and a 2–2 home draw against West Ham, {{resulting}} in Chelsea slipping down to tenth. Chelsea registered a 1–4 away win at AFC Bournemouth, with Eden Hazard <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> on the score sheet, and after going down 0–2 against rivals Tottenham, fought back to draw 2–2, Hazard again scoring to seal away any chances of title contenders Tottenham winning the Premier League. Chelsea drew 1–1 away to Liverpool and played out a 1-1 home draw against Leicester City, with Claudio Ranieri, former Chelsea boss, being received a guard of honour.

25|$|At 15:48, {{with the}} {{opposing}} forces roughly parallel at , with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., {{on the right}} side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the Run to the South, in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except Princess Royal fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> the range. Only Lion and Princess Royal had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{variable}} performances, he {{was kept in}} the side that toured Pakistan in 1985–86. However, he went wicketless {{in the first two}} Tests, despite bowling a total of 48 overs, before <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> his first Test wicket at Karachi. Fellow spinner Abdul Qadir was his victim, caught by Sidath Wettimuny, which finally gave him a Test bowling average. By the end of the match, however, that average had been set to 297 – where it remained, giving him the highest bowling average (for a time, West Indian Rawl Lewis overtook Wijesuriya with one wicket for more than 300 runs but more success in 2008 brought down Lewis' bowling average). He also recorded his best ODI bowling figures on that tour, taking two for 25 from five overs, and also battling out to score 12 runs after the top order had been taken apart by Mudassar Nazar, Mohsin Kamal and Abdul Qadir. Despite the credible performance from Wijesuriya, Sri Lanka lost the match by 89 runs, and they suffered a 4–0 defeat in the ODI series and lost the Test series 2–0.|$|E
25|$|After the Bulls' Michael Jordan {{made what}} would be his first {{retirement}} from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, many saw {{this as an opportunity}} for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 67, {{and still}} financially embarrassed, Nicholson resumed his writing, <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> his Treatise on Dialing {{published}} in Newcastle in 1833, {{and set up a}} school in the recently opened Royal Arcade, which he ran for a few years, though it was not a financial success. He was nevertheless highly regarded by the local people and was awarded honorary memberships of a number of local institutions, including the Newcastle Mechanics' Institute. In 1834, an attempt was made to raise, by public subscription, sufficient funds to purchase an annuity for his benefit, but as only £320 was raised it was deemed insufficient for the purpose and was handed directly to Nicholson to help with his immediate needs, and a petition was sent to the king in an attempt to secure a pension for him from the Privy Purse. In October 1836, he was elected President of the Newcastle Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts and in August 1838, he presented a paper entitled Principles of Oblique Bridges to the eighth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which was held in Newcastle.|$|E
25|$|Maloney {{left the}} club {{at the end}} of the 2002 season but his {{replacement}} proved to be a key in Glory <b>finally</b> <b>getting</b> that elusive title. German midfielder Andre Gumprecht was brought into the club thanks to Stange and made an instant impact. With the NSL disintegrating around them, Glory and Olympic were the only two semi-decent teams still left in the league to galvanise their midfield and fought it out for top spot all season. Glory missed out on the league title, finishing one point behind Olympic. In March 2003, the NSL stripped the club of three points after ruling that Gumprecht had been played before he had been registered. Glory picked up Socceroo Simon Colosimo halfway through the season and eventually won the right to host the 2003 Grand Final after coming out on top of a new, confusing and convoluted league table finals format that had dragged a poor season out. In the Grand Final Glory took the game to Olympic and following a headed goal from in the first half from Harnwell it was all over late in the match when Mori saw his shot dribble over the line in dramatic fashion. 2–0 was the end result and d'Avray had delivered the Grand Final victory Glory had yearned for.|$|E
