5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly.

5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic {{studies of}} the {{brightest}} spiral nebulae to determine their composition.

5|$|In 1958, Howe {{was made}} {{chancellor}} of Dalhousie University. On investigating the university's finances, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a professor's salary in 1958 had less buying power {{than when he}} had worked there. Howe urged increased salaries and building improvements to attract first-rate scholars to the university. He also accepted a number of honorary degrees from other universities.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Peter Dodson, {{examining}} {{why there}} should be so many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within such a short geological time frame and small area, published {{the results of a}} morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes. For Lambeosaurus, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the nasal bone with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1960s, Mikhail Ivanovich Budyko {{worked with}} simple {{two-dimensional}} energy-balance climate models {{to investigate the}} reflectivity of ice. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could provoke the onset of an ice age.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch {{published}} {{a paper on}} early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and relatives were actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were the only true cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however that further work on the group might reveal different conclusions.|$|E

5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|While the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) of nodosaurids {{have not}} been firmly established, the genera Sauropelta, Silvisaurus and Pawpawsaurus are sometimes considered to be basal to geologically younger nodosaurids like Panoplosaurus, Edmontonia, and Animantarx. In a 2001 analysis, Carpenter included the former three genera in a sister clade to a group containing the latter three, although <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Panoplosaurus could belong to either clade, depending which taxa and characters were chosen.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature of his teammates, which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E
