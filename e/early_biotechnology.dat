40|$|A partial-equilibrium, two-country {{model is}} {{developed}} to analyze implications from {{the introduction of}} genetically modified (GM) products. In the model, innovators hold proprietary rights, farmers are (competitive) adopters, some consumers deem GM food to be inferior in quality to traditional food, and the mere introduction of GM crops affects the costs of non-GM food (because of costly identity preservation). Among the results derived, it is shown that, although GM innovations {{have the potential to}} improve efficiency, some groups can be made worse off. Indeed, it is even possible that the costs induced by GM innovations outweigh the efficiency gains.

40|$|Biotechnology {{techniques}} {{have been widely}} used for legumes - important crops with excellent nutritional characteristics and soil improvement qualities. Limited work has been carried out with underutilized legume crops such as velvet bean (Mucuna spp.), which have great potential for multiple uses. In recent decades, there has been increased interest in the potential of Mucuna spp. as a cover crop and green manure for tropical and subtropical regions. Mucuna is also used as a minor food crop in many countries and interest in it as livestock feed - a common use for it in the early 1900 s in the USA and elsewhere - is growing. Other minor uses exist, such as roasting the seeds as a coffee substitute. More importantly, L-dopa, extracted from Mucuna bean seeds and plants, is used for symptomatic relief of Parkinson';s disease. Despite these numerous qualities, some constraints have limited its adoption. Biotechnology techniques can provide a window of opportunity for new or expanding products of Mucuna. <b>Earlier</b> <b>biotechnology</b> work with Mucuna was mostly related to its medicinal uses and focused on the mechanism of L-dopa production. More recently, biotechnology has also been applied to identify the major virus diseases affecting Mucuna, to develop new diagnostic methods for early virus indexing of in vitro plants and to clean virus diseases using meristem and thermotherapy techniques, as well as to study genetic diversity through the use of molecular tools. There are still niches to be explored such as the numerous phytochemical qualities of Mucuna {{that can be used to}} benefit human and animal nutrition and health as well as the environment through use of these compounds in natural weed and pest control management...|$|R
30|$|The third {{strategy}} for avoiding venture capital influence {{was seen as}} entering a strategic development partnership with a large pharmaceutical company {{very early in the}} development process, rather than developing the product on one’s own and offering it to different companies at a later stage. The advantage of such a strategy was seen in being able to orient the work process towards the long-term necessities of drug development rather than having to consider the importance of presenting development highlights for the next financing round. While again one company in the cluster was seen as a successful example of this strategy, founders were aware that pharmaceutical companies offer such cooperation agreements to <b>early</b> stage <b>biotechnology</b> companies only in very rare cases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>earliest</b> {{industrial}} <b>biotechnology</b> {{originated in}} ancient China and {{developed into a}} vibrant industry in traditional Chinese liquor, rice wine, soy sauce, and vinegar. It is now a significant component of the Chinese economy valued annually at about 150 billion RMB.

2500|$|Amongst the <b>earliest</b> uses of <b>biotechnology</b> in {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturing {{is the use}} of recombinant DNA technology to modify Escherichia coli bacteria to produce human insulin, which was performed at Genentech in 1978. [...] Prior to the development of this technique, insulin was extracted from the pancreas glands of cattle, pigs, and other farm animals. [...] While generally efficacious in the treatment of diabetes, animal-derived insulin is not indistinguishable from human insulin, and may therefore produce allergic reactions. Genentech researchers produced artificial genes for each of the two protein chains that comprise the insulin molecule. [...] The artificial genes were [...] "then inserted... into plasmids... among a group of genes that" [...] are activated by lactose. [...] Thus, the insulin-producing genes were also activated by lactose. [...] The recombinant plasmids were inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria, which were [...] "induced to produce 100,000 molecules of either chain A or chain B human insulin." [...] The two protein chains were then combined to produce insulin molecules.|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, the moss Physcomitrella patens has been {{developed}} and employed as a model species for comparative studies of plant biology {{as well as a}} safe production system for <b>biotechnology.</b> <b>Early</b> on, the generation and dissemination of transcriptomic and genomic resources was an important focal point of Physcomitrella research, which, together with the ease of genetic modification and flexibility of cultivation, over the years has attracted more and more research groups all around the world to use this moss as a model for basic and applied research. The establishment of genomic resources has culminated {{in the role of the}} P. patens genome as a reference genome for plant evolution. There are two main parts of this chapter: in the first part we provide an overview and history of the established genomic resources and in the second part we summarize the current biological knowledge about the genome structure, nature of nonprotein- and protein-coding genes including codon usage bias, repeats and transposable elements encoded by the Physcomitrella genome and, where applicable, discuss these attributes in an evolutionary context. Furthermore, we focus on the duplicated parts of the moss genome, like the paralogous genes that were retained after ancestral, large-scale to whole-genome duplication events and can be used to gain insights into the evolutionary history of Physcomitrella. Finally, we conclude this chapter by highlighting a special class of ancient paralogs in the Physcomitrella genome that have been actively retained as redundant copies and might act as pseudoalleles...|$|R
40|$|Developments in {{biotechnology}} {{are increasingly}} {{bound up with}} food production, and have growing implications for practitioners and policy-makers in research and development. <b>Early</b> applications of <b>biotechnology</b> in agricultural production addressed yield potential and resistance in plants to diseases and insect pests. Nowadays, research has started to offer products that improve human health and nutrition or even repair environmental damage. These developments appear to be going so fast {{that it is difficult}} to keep up not only with the technical developments but also with related policy, safety and managerial implications. Potential benefits and risks to society need to be made clear, and scientists and policy makers made accountable to meet the demands from society. This increasingly asks for rapid exchange of information and experiences. Managing Agricultural Biotechnology responds to this need. The contributions address the relevance of biotechnology for the South; the problem of priority setting in agricultural research; how to manage biotechnological research and regional or international cooperation; environmental implications and the question of intellectual property rights.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the regional distribution {{of new life}} science company formation and highlights 'hotspots' of where new activity is relatively intense. The analysis indicates that there are generally two types of region, the first type contains life science clusters that were established during the early 2000 s and the second type displayed little or no significant life science activity during this period. This study analyses survey data (n= 580) and evidences new patterns of life science company activity within peripheral UK regions. The study shows that new life science activity is occurring away from the traditional 'Golden Triangle' of London, Cambridge and Oxford. New life science company activity {{can be found in}} peripheral regions such as the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, the North West and in Scotland. The evidence contained in this study suggests that new UK life science company activity is supported by the presence of UK biotechnology incubators. During the early 2000 s there were only a handful of biotechnology incubators in the UK, by 2012 there over twenty-five. This study provides evidence to suggest that UK biotechnology incubators {{play an important role in}} supporting new life science companies. Since the <b>early</b> 2000 s, <b>biotechnology</b> incubators have appeared in the same regions that display significant levels of new life science company activity. Furthermore, significant proportions of new life science companies are located in biotechnology incubators within regions that displayed little or no significant life science activity during the early 2000 s.

40|$|The {{pipeline}} productivity {{challenge facing}} large, publicly traded pharmaceutical companies, collectively {{referred to as}} "Big Pharma," is well known. The unprecedented success Big Pharma achieved {{over the past few}} decades in commercializing blockbuster products means that it is now faced with near-term patent expirations on such products, representing billions of dollars in lost sales and profits. In order to maintain its economic momentum, Big Pharma is increasingly relying on the universe of smaller, <b>early</b> stage <b>biotechnology</b> and pharmaceutical companies as a source of new products. Early stage companies may offer Big Pharma something beyond simply more product bets. Several recent consulting studies have shown that economic returns to Big Pharma of products sourced externally are greater than those developed internally, which raises the question: What, if anything, are early stage companies doing differently from Big Pharma in their product development programs? The goal of this thesis is to evaluate product development programs ("projects") and compare qualitatively and quantitatively the decisions for projects at key decision points between early stage pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and Big Pharma. Given that much of the critical discovery and R&D work on pharmaceutical products happens both before and during a product's entry into human clinical trials, this thesis focuses on those areas of the development continuum where R&D plays a central role. The key decision points are therefore: lead candidate selection/optimization, moving a project from pre-clinical trials into Phase I human clinical trials, and moving a project from Phase I to Phase II clinical trials in humans. (cont.) The thesis tests the hypothesis that small, early stage, publicly traded U. S. & Canadian biotech and pharma firms (Small Pharma) focused on 1 - 2 therapeutic areas who high levels of homogeneity in their decision making process, number of decision inputs, prioritization processes, and metrics for all three key decision points in the product development process irrespective of whether a product originates inside or outside the company. In comparison, Big Pharma companies will show heterogeneity in these variables for their projects. I have obtained data from primary interviews of industry executives within Big Pharma and Small Pharma firms. The therapeutic areas selected for the early stage company data set are: (1) cancer and autoimmune disease, (2) cardiovascular disease, and (3) infectious disease. The rationale for these therapeutic areas is that there is significant drug development activity taking place in these fields, and there are significant unmet medical needs within them. Additionally, both Big Pharma and Small Pharma companies are developing products in these fields. I compare these data sets statistically using Fisher's exact test and Yates' chi-square test. by Daniel S. Rippy. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, 2007.
