25|$|Manufacturing in Scotland {{has shifted}} its focus, with heavy {{industries}} such as shipbuilding and iron and steel declining in their importance and contribution to the economy. It <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>argued</b> {{that this has been}} in response to increasing globalisation and competition from low cost producers across the world, which has eroded Scotland's comparative advantage in such industries over the later half of the 20th century. However, the decline in heavy industry in Scotland has been supplanted with the rise in the manufacture of lighter, less labour-intensive products such as optoelectronics, software, chemical products and derivatives as well as life sciences. The engineering and defence sectors employ around 30,000 people in Scotland. The principal companies operating in the sector include; BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon, Alexander Dennis, Thales, SELEX Galileo and Babcock. The decline of heavy industry resulted in a sectoral shift of labour. This led to smaller firms strengthening links with the academic community and substantial, industry-specific retraining programmes for the workforce.|$|E

50|$|Like many contemporaries, Olivares was 'haunted' by Spain's {{potential}} decline, and saw part of {{the solution}} at least in a reform of the Spanish state. Olivares saw Catalan and the other provinces as paying less to the crown than they should, and did not really understand why the inhabitants should object to a fairer distribution of taxes. He was confident in the intellectual argument for a better defended, better ordered Spain, and never seems to have shown serious doubt that his plans would succeed, or understood the growing hatred against his rule. These plans took form first in Olivares' Unión de Armas, or 'Union of Arms' concept, put forward in 1624. This would have involved the different elements of Philip's territories raising fixed quotas of soldiers in line with their size and population. Despite being portrayed by Olivares as a purely military plan, it reflected Olivares' desire for a more closely unified Spain - although not, it <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>argued,</b> a completely unified kingdom.|$|E

This theory is strengthened by the idea of 'visual territories' which operates from the assumption that all ringfort in a region were probably occupied contemporarily, and that in a particular area one ringfort would be in the sight of at least one other neighbouring ringfort so that if one ringfort were attacked, relief would possibly come from a neighbouring one. Furthermore, a number of aspects of the generally circular nature of the ringfort highlight the defensive advantages, most notably that a circle as a shape [...] "offered broad perspectives of approaching attackers and allowed the maximum area to be enclosed relative to the length of the bank constructed." ...|$|E

Essentially every time someone used an American Express Card in the area, a 2-cent donation was triggered and each time new members applied for a card a larger contribution was made.

A pedagogy that both uses and reinforces the culture of ethnic minority students, implemented by ethnically similar teachers, is therefore thought to contribute to a more constructive school experience and strengthen the social and political status of the ethnic community as a whole. For this thesis, a group of Haitian educators working in Montreal area schools was interviewed to investigate the extent to which this approach is viewed as a potential solution to the low academic achievement of numerous Haitian students. Some evidence was found that culturally congruent education is, according to the experiences of some of the respondents, a potentially beneficial strategy to curtail educational inequality.

5000|$|It <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>argued</b> that Maxwell {{equations}} are manifestly Lorentz covariant {{while the}} electromagnetic stress-energy tensor {{follows from the}} Maxwell equations; thus the EM momentum defined from the EM tensor certainly respects the principle of relativity. For example, some scientists suggested that “the original (Abraham-Minkowski) debate is {{in regard to the}} 4 × 4 energy-momentum tensor (electromagnetic stress-energy tensor)”. However a study indicates that “such an argument is based on an incomplete understanding of the relativity principle”, and states that the EM stress-energy tensor is not sufficient to define EM momentum correctly. [...] That is because, in a material medium, which is different from empty space, a covariant EM tensor usually does not guarantee that all the elements of the tensor have the same physical meanings in all inertial frames due to the existence of possible [...] "intrinsic Lorentz violation", while the relativity principle requires that the mathematical equations describing a physical law must be the same in form in all inertial frames, and the specific physical implications of the equations must also be the same. For example, the principle of relativity requires: (i) the mathematical expressions of Maxwell equations be the same in form in all inertial frames, and (ii) the physical implications of all field quantities E, B, D, H, J and [...] appearing in the Maxwell equations be also the same.|$|E

The Carron Company established its ironworks at Falkirk in 1759, initially using imported ore but later using locally sourced Ironstone. The iron industry expanded tenfold between 1830 and 1844. The shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde increased greatly from the 1840s and by 1870 the Clyde was producing more than half of Britain's tonnage of shipping.

The latter are often said to be particularly or solely suitable for extensive husbandry mostly based on small ruminants. However, many local {{sheep and goat}} breeds are presently endangered. Both conserving these breeds and maintaining an active agricultural presence in marginal areas are presently two major priorities for agricultural and rural development policy in Europe. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse the spatial link between the geographic distribution of traditional, locally adapted sheep and goat breeds and the relative marginality of regions. The concept of marginal areas is discussed and defined and an index of relative marginality is computed in a Geographic Information System. The index combines land use, demographic and socio-economic data. The correlation between the marginality of a region measured by the index and the geographic distribution of sheep and goat breeds is analysed using a simple logit model. The broader interest of the index as a tool for agricultural and rural development policy applications is then discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of possible sources of relative advantage of small and large firms with respect to innovation, that have been put forward in the economic and management literature. The relative strengths of large firms lie mostly in resources, while those of small firms <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> <b>argued</b> in terms of behavioral characteristics. It is however not either small firms or large firms which are the better innovators. Small and large firms are likely to play complementary roles {{in the process of}} technical advance, {{in the sense that they}} are better at different types of innovation. A challenge for management would be to find ways to combine large firm resources with some of the advantages of small-scale organization, or for small firms to compensate some of their scale disadvantages by R&D cooperation and the development of networks. As an example of how large and small firm advantages may be combined, I discuss the case of 3 M. Maintaining mutually complementary relationships appears to be an increasingly important factor determining innovative success, especially for smaller firms. Two examples of successful networks of SME’s are discussed in the final section of the paper. ...|$|R

Hence, in this work, attention is focused on examining whether or not Africans do have a philosophy by establishing {{at least one of the}} avenues through which any philosophy can be expressed i. e. through a language. The oriental philosophy can be expressed in oriental language while western philosophy can be expressed in western language. Can African philosophy be expressed in African language like the other two world cultures? If it can, then, the existence of African philosophy is not impossible. Thus, this paper stands to examine language as a source through which authentic African philosophy as one of the authentic world recognized and famous philosophies can be possible...|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> <b>argued</b> that Christian V's {{personal}} {{courage and}} affability made him popular among the common people, but his image {{was marred by}} his unsuccessful attempt to regain Scania for Denmark in the Scanian War. The war exhausted Denmark's economic resources without securing any gains. Part of Christian's appeal to the common people {{may be explained by}} the fact that he allowed Danish commoners into state service, but his attempts to curtail the influence of the nobility also meant continuing his father's drive toward absolutism. To accommodate non-aristocrats into state service, he created the new noble ranks of count and baron. One of the commoners elevated in this way by the king was Peder Schumacher, named Count Griffenfeld by Christian V in 1670 and high councillor of Denmark in 1674.Griffenfeld, a skilled statesman, better understood the precarious situation Denmark placed itself by attacking Sweden at a time when the country was allied with France, the major European power of the era. As Griffenfeld predicted, Sweden's stronger ally France was the party that dictated the peace with Denmark's ally Holland, and in spite of Danish victory at sea in the battles against Sweden in 1675-1679 during the Scanian War, Danish hopes for border changes on the Scandinavian Peninsula between the two countries were dashed. The results of the war efforts proved politically and financially unremunerative for Denmark. The damage to the Danish economy was extensive. At this point, Christian V no longer had his most experienced foreign relations counsel around to repair the political damage — in 1676 he had been persuaded to sacrifice Griffenfeld as a traitor, and to the clamour of his adversaries, Griffenfeld was imprisoned for the remainder of his life.After the Scanian War, his sister, Princess Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark, married the Swedish king Charles XI, whose mother was a stout supporter of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. In spite of the family ties, war between the brothers-in-law was close again in 1689, when Charles XI nearly provoked confrontation with Denmark by his support of the exiled Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp in his claims to Holstein-Gottorp in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|E

Judaism is a corporeal religion, in which membership is based not on belief but rather descent from Abraham, physically marked by circumcision, and focusing on how to live this life properly. According to Boyarin, Paul saw in the [...] "symbol" [...] of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal messiah. He used this notion of messiah, so Boyarin, to argue for a religion through which all people—not just descendants of Abraham—could worship the God of Abraham. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.|$|R

When this idea became obsolete, the prevailing opinion of proponents and opponents alike shifted to the notion of the computer as merely adding to present design capabilities. This idea is so ingrained in our thinking that we still speak of “aidingi design with computers. It is clear to those who grasp the real potential of this still new technology - as in the case of many other major technological innovations - that it continues to change the way we design, rather than to merely augment or replace human designers. In the classroom the computer has the potential to radically change three fundamental ingredients: student, instruction, and instructor. It is obvious that changes of this kind spell out a commensurate change in design pedagogy. If the computer is going to be more than a passive instrument in the design studio, then design pedagogy will have to be changed, fundamentally. While the practice of computing in the studio continues to be a significant I aspect of architectural education, articulation of viable pedagogy for use in the design studio is truly rare.
