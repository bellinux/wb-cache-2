5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common <b>epiphytes</b> are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common <b>epiphytes</b> include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and grow on other plants (<b>epiphytes)</b> or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or <b>epiphytes,</b> often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E
40|$|Historically, small {{invertebrate}} grazers {{in marine}} plant communities {{have been considered}} to be a relatively homogeneous group in their impact on ecosystem processes. However, recent studies propose that species composition is an important agent in determining grazer effects. We used four mesocosm experiments to test the biomass-specific and density-dependent effects of common mesograzers in temperate regions (Littorina littorea, Rissoa membranacea, Idotea baltica and Gammarus oceanicus) on <b>epiphyte</b> and eelgrass biomass and productivity. Mesograzer species identity strongly influenced <b>epiphyte</b> accumulation and eelgrass growth, where Rissoa was the most efficient mesograzer (per biomass) and Gammarus had the weakest impact. Density-dependent effects varied considerably among species. Both gastropod species reduced <b>epiphyte</b> accumulation in direct proportion to their density, and Littorina had the strongest negative effect on <b>epiphyte</b> biomass. The impact of Idotea seemed to level off to a threshold value and Gammarus had no density-dependent effect on <b>epiphyte</b> accumulation at all. Rissoa and Idotea increased eelgrass productivity in accordance with their effect on <b>epiphyte</b> accumulation, whereas Littorina showed a less positive effect than could be expected by its strong impact on <b>epiphyte</b> biomass. Gammarus had no significant impact on eelgrass growth. Our results show that the different functional traits of superficially similar mesograzers can have important consequences for ecosystem processes in macrophyte systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of two cryptic, seagrass-inhabiting omnivorous fishes, the fan-bellied leatherjacket Monacanthus chinensis and the variable sabretoothed blenny Petroscirtes variabilis, on seagrass <b>epiphyte</b> biomass are described. Overall, M. chinensis significantly reduced <b>epiphyte</b> biomass by 35 · 1 % after 18 [*]h in experimental aquaria, whilst P. variabilis showed a non-significant 15 · 7 % reduction. It is concluded that some cryptic omnivorous species {{play an important}} role in <b>epiphyte</b> removal in seagrass beds...|$|R
40|$|Red algae {{demonstrate}} significant {{phenotypic plasticity}} and convergent evolution, making morphological species identification difficult. Microscopic {{members of this}} lineage further complicate identification by their limited number of morphological features. An unidentified red algal <b>epiphyte</b> (minute in size and composed of a few cells) was discovered growing on another red alga (Camontagnea oxyclada) collected in Stanley, Tasmania, Australia. This organism was originally detected as contamination during routine DNA barcoding surveys. Genetic data facilitates the discrimination between morphologically similar red algae, including this unique sample of Camontagnea oxyclada with its unknown red algal <b>epiphyte.</b> The objective {{of this research was}} to sequence commonly used phylogenetic markers (cox 1, cob, rbcL, psaB, psaA, psbA) from both the host and <b>epiphyte</b> to place them in a wider red algal phylogenetic context, and to annotate the organellar genome contigs of the host and <b>epiphyte.</b> ^ DNA was extracted for the combined red algal host and <b>epiphyte</b> using a micro-phenol-chloroform method and sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform. The phylogenetic markers for each organism were then located and aligned within a concatenated data set. Phylogenetic placement of the organisms was determined using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. The robust placement of the host, Camontagnea oxyclada, as a sister genus to Rhodothamniella in the Palmariales, Nemaliophycidae, was confirmed. The <b>epiphyte,</b> on the other hand, was firmly allied as a sister to the genus Ballia, Balliales, also within the Nemaliophycidae, but at a large genetic distance. A new florideophyte order will be created to classify the novel alga. The organellar genome contigs of the host and <b>epiphyte</b> were annotated, after de novo assembly, from the Miseq data, referencing currently available Florideophycean genomes from Genbank. The majority of the mitochondrion (mtDNA) and plastid (ptDNA) genomes were recovered as several contigs, for both the host and the <b>epiphyte.</b> A total of 25 protein encoding genes and 20 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) were recovered for the host mitochondrion genome. The <b>epiphyte</b> had 12 protein encoding genes and 14 tRNAs recovered. The unique arrangement of the cox 1 gene is conserved across the host and <b>epiphyte</b> in the mtDNA. Additionally, 178 protein coding genes and 29 tRNAs were recovered for the host plastid genome, and 161 protein coding genes and 25 tRNAs were recovered for the <b>epiphyte</b> plastid genome. For both the host and <b>epiphyte</b> ptDNA the segment of DNA from the chlL-chlN genes through the ycf 60 -rps 6 genes, just before the ribosomal RNAs, was inverted when compared to the Calliarthron tuberculosum plastid genome. The phylogenetic placement of this new <b>epiphyte</b> in the red algal tree of life has helped to uncover a potentially new order and further clarify red algal diversity. The mitochondrion and plastid contigs of the host and <b>epiphyte</b> provide insight into organellar genome evolution in red algae as a whole and specifically within the Nemaliophycidae where both organisms group phylogenetically. ...|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} tree support their own {{specialised}} invertebrates. In their natural habitats, 284 {{different species of}} insect have been found on the English oak (Quercus robur) and 306 species of invertebrate on the Tasmanian oak (Eucalyptus obliqua). Non-native tree species provide a less biodiverse community, for example in the United Kingdom the sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern Europe, has few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports {{a wide range of}} lichens, bryophytes and other <b>epiphytes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant <b>epiphytes,</b> such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as <b>epiphytes.</b>|$|E

40|$|Field {{studies have}} shown {{a wide array of}} {{responses}} of vascular <b>epiphyte</b> diversity to human disturbance-assemblages of disturbed habitats range from largely unchanged to severely impoverished when compared with intact forest. This variability is not well understood. We explored the hypothesis that the relative impoverishment of disturbed-habitat <b>epiphyte</b> assemblages is a function of local climate, by analyzing the available literature on <b>epiphyte</b> diversity on isolated trees as a model system. We found that assemblages of moist and moderately seasonal areas experience considerably stronger impoverishment than those of aseasonally wet or distinctly dry areas. We argue that the integrity of the vertical microclimatic gradient is more crucial for the maintenance of <b>epiphyte</b> diversity in moderately seasonal forests than in distinctly dry or aseasonally wet forests...|$|R
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for <b>epiphytes</b> to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among <b>epiphytes,</b> emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} the region {{are known to be}} {{evergreen}} type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. The topmost level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona ciliata), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, <b>epiphytes</b> (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region.|$|E

5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon <b>epiphytes</b> Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of <b>epiphytes.</b> Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E
25|$|Some South American {{tropical}} {{species are}} <b>epiphytes,</b> {{and can be}} found growing in wet moss and spongy bark on trees in rainforests, or even in the watery leaf-rosettes of other <b>epiphytes</b> such as various Tillandsia (a type of bromeliad) species. Rosette-forming <b>epiphytes</b> such as U.nelumbifolia put out runners, searching for other nearby bromeliads to colonise.|$|E

25|$|Bromeliads {{seem very}} well preadapted to carnivory, {{but only one}} or two species can be {{classified}} as truly carnivorous. By their very shape, bromeliads will benefit from increased prey-derived nutrient input. In this sense, bromeliads are probably carnivorous, but their habitats are too dark for more extreme, recognisable carnivory to evolve. Most bromeliads are <b>epiphytes,</b> and most <b>epiphytes</b> grow in partial shade on tree branches. Brocchinia reducta, on the other hand, is a ground dweller.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{individuals}} of Orthalicus reses reses grow is dependent upon the availability of food, and how quickly their food is replenished after being grazed.

25|$|Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) {{flourish}} in the park, due partly to the area's mild oceanic climate. The park is internationally significant for bryophytes.

Many of them live as <b>epiphytes,</b> growing on the branches and trunks of trees.|$|E
25|$|A {{commensalism}} is {{an interaction}} {{in which one}} species benefits and the other species is unaffected. <b>Epiphytes</b> (plants growing on other plants, usually trees) have a commensal relationship with their host plant because the epiphyte benefits in some way (e.g., by escaping competition with terrestrial plants or by gaining greater access to sunlight) while the host plant is apparently unaffected.|$|E
