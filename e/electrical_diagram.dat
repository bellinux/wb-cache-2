40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>diagram</b> is {{foundation}} of studies in electrical science. A circuit diagram convey many {{information about the}} system. Behind any device {{there are plenty of}} electrical ingredients which perform their specific tasks, today all the electrical software tools failed to effectively convert the information automatically from a circuit image diagram to digital form. Hence electrical engineers should manually enter all information into computers, and this process takes time and bring errors with high probability. Moreover, when the diagram is hand drawn, the problem is more complicated for any electrical analysis. Thus, in this paper we propose a new method using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to make a machine that can directly read the electrical symbols from a hand drawn circuit image. The recognition process involves two steps: first step is feature extraction using shape based features, and the second one is a classification procedure using ANN through a back propagation algorithm. The ANN was trained and tested with different hand drawn electrical images. The results show that our proposal is viable and brings good performances...|$|E
40|$|Consequently, {{many other}} main circuit components, in {{addition}} to the filter components, such as switching equipment, CTs, etc, must be installed. The filters will therefore take up considerable space in a converter sta-tion. 2. 2 De-coupling of filtering and reactive power supply The development of new, effective AC filters, described in a separate section of this paper, makes it possible to perform the filtering function through a single filter bank with small Mvar rating. The new AC filter thus allows de-coupling of the functions of the filtering and the reactive power generation to a large extent. In this situation, the traditional way of generating the required reactive power would be to install a number of shunt capacitor banks. However, during the last few years, another concept, the capacitor commutated converter, abbreviated CCC, which provides a much more interesting solution, has been studied and developed. 2. 3 The CCC concept The <b>electrical</b> <b>diagram</b> of a CCC is shown in Fig. 2.
