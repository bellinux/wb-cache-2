5|$|Initially, the New Zealand attack progressed well, but the German {{defenders}} regained their composure and {{the attack}} lost momentum against heavily fortified defensive positions. By 21:00, the NZ 24th Infantry Battalion had fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> slow {{house to house}} fighting to {{the centre of the}} town, but were pinned down with no prospect of further progress without significant armoured support. However, a combination of concealed minefields and well dug in German armour made the task of the Allied tanks impossible. In the early hours of 8 December, the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—ordered a withdrawal from the town with a view to renewing the attack after further softening up from artillery and bombers.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, the great Renaissance began to elbow <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> to the exclusion of Gothic design. But the process was not sudden, and much transition work has great merit. The rood screen at Hurst, Berkshire, the stall work of Cartmel Priory, Westmorland, and the bench ends of many of the churches in Somerset, give good illustrations. But the new style was unequal to the old in devotional feeling, except in classic buildings like St Paul's Cathedral, where the stalls of Grinling Gibbons better suit their own surroundings. The rest of this article will therefore be devoted in the main to domestic work, and the exact location of examples can only be given when not the property of private owners or where the public have access.|$|E

25|$|The {{planners}} for {{the operation}} were faced with a significant problem. While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260km from the border and deep inside Angola. This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> and out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia - SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape. Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage.|$|E

25|$|She had {{her final}} year of {{competition}} in 1936 and the biggest races of her career came at the Berlin Olympic Games. In June, prior to the Olympics, she helped set a European record in the 4 × 100 m relay, timing 46.5 seconds in Köln {{with a team of}} Emmy Albus, Krauss, and Grete Debus-Winkels. At the Berling Olympics, Dollinger won both her heat and semi-final in the women's 100m but was again narrowly beaten out of the medal positions and finished fourth (this time to her compatriot Krauss). Redemption seemed be on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> the women's 4×100 metres relay heats, where Albus, Krauss, Dollinger and Ilse Dörffeldt established a new Olympic and world record time of 46.4 seconds – finishing a full second ahead of the British team. In the relay final the German team had built up a large lead by the point that Dollinger handed the baton to Dörffeldt for the last leg of the race. Dörffeldt dropped the baton, however, much to the disappointment of the home crowd, and the team were disqualified. This was Dollinger's last performance at a major event and ended her career without having won an Olympic medal.|$|E

500|$|Mehldau often plays a {{separate}} melody with each hand, {{and one of}} the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint. He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: [...] "If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in.</b> If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that." [...] Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of [...] "All the Things You Are" [...] on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and [...] "I Didn't Know What Time It Was" [...] on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.|$|E

Frangipani returned with an answer from Suleiman, on 6 February 1526, initiating the first steps of a Franco-Ottoman alliance. [...] Suleiman eventually wrote an ultimatum to Charles, asking for the immediate release of Francis—and demanding a yearly tax from the Holy Roman Empire; when this was not forthcoming, the Ottomans launched an invasion of Hungary in the summer of 1526, aiming to reach Vienna.|$|E

Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him but is that by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E
500|$|The press-boxes of Kilburn's time, {{particularly}} in Yorkshire, were unfriendly and serious places. According to Wisden, [...] " [...] was a tall, austere {{man who had}} little truck with press-box banter." [...] According to writer Derek Hodgson, Kilburn was shy. However, his views and methods were regarded as old-fashioned in the later stages of his career. Kilburn was often compared to his contemporary from Lancashire, Neville Cardus, but his style was dissimilar. Cardus wrote in a romantic style whereas Kilburn preferred factual accuracy; according to Wisden, Kilburn was [...] "harder, less flashy, more punctilious". Journalist Frank Keating writes: [...] "Neville Cardus was acclaimed the Wordsworth of cricket writing, while across the Pennines they hailed Kilburn as the Coleridge. With good reason." [...] Kilburn's writings on the Yorkshire players of the 1930s and 1940s made them well-known {{to the public as}} personalities, and he wrote several pieces for the Yorkshire Post which became famous. Kilburn had a deep love of cricket, and worried it was losing <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> embracing one-day matches and sponsorship, although he did not believe that progress was necessarily bad. He believed that cricketers should be chivalrous, and greatly admired stylish play. He severely criticised anything on the field which he believed fell short of acceptable standards, including the occasion in 1967 when Yorkshire won the County Championship after engaging in time-wasting tactics to avoid losing a game. He retired in 1976, but continued to follow the sport very closely.|$|E
