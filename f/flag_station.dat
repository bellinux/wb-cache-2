This flag is shown at the discretion of the marshals manning the station.|$|E
25|$|In all championships {{which use}} the FIA International Sporting Code, {{as well as}} North American road racing, the white flag {{indicates}} {{the presence of an}} official car or a competitor moving at below normal speed in the section of track covered by the <b>flag</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
500|$|At the <b>Flag</b> <b>Station</b> Wilkes and {{his eight}} {{remaining}} men built a circular wall of lava rocks {{and covered the}} shelter with a canvas tent. A snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from altitude sickness. That night (December 23), the snow on the canvas roof caused it to collapse. At daylight some of the group went down the trail to retrieve firewood and the gear abandoned on the trail the day before. After another day's climb, nine men reached the rim of Mokuʻāweoweo. They {{could not find a}} way down its steep sides so chose a smooth place on the rim for the camp site, at coordinates [...] Their tent was pitched within [...] of the crater's edge, secured by lava blocks.|$|E
25|$|The South African {{government}} {{published guidelines}} for proper {{display of the}} flag at designated <b>flag</b> <b>stations,</b> in Government Notice 510 of 8 June 2001 (Gazette number 22356). These rules apply only to official <b>flag</b> <b>stations</b> {{and not to the}} general public.|$|R
25|$|In some series, a {{white flag}} is shown from all <b>flag</b> <b>stations</b> {{on the first}} lap of a {{practice}} or qualifying session so competitors will know which stations are manned.|$|R
50|$|Set out to {{minimize}} large cuttings, large fills, {{and to avoid}} the need for bridges, the Murray Harbour Subdivision consisted of twenty-two stops: initially 9, then 13, booking <b>stations</b> and nine <b>flag</b> <b>stations.</b> The Booking Stations, in design, had a pleasing construction and arrangement, with a freight shed and sometimes with detached facilities. The <b>Flag</b> <b>Stations</b> over time changed from being ‘Open Ended Sheds’ to ‘Closed In Sheds’ - with single or double doors and windows. In addition to the stations, there were two water tanks and a full engine house - it located in Murray Harbour.|$|R
2500|$|The {{junction}} {{with the}} main line was at a <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> known as Beach, and the line terminated at Hutt Park, a 122-metre long platform by the western bank of the Hutt River. In the 1901 Working Timetable these two stops are called Petone Junction and Racecourse Platform respectively. [...] Trains ran whenever there was a race meeting, approximately {{four times a year}} for one or two days, from Te Aro {{at the end of the}} Te Aro Extension via Lambton Railway Station, a predecessor of Wellington Railway Station. They were run by the New Zealand Railways Department on behalf of the Hutt Park Railway Company and typically employed a WA class tank locomotive as motive power.|$|E
2500|$|The ship's bell from [...] (which {{served as}} a troopship from 1942 to 1949) was removed when the ship was sold by her Australian owners in 1960, and was {{presented}} to the College in 1978. It is now positioned {{at the base of the}} <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> near the parade ground and is used daily as part of the cadets' flag duties. Many of the original buildings from when the College was first opened in 1911 still stand and continue to be used today, having been heritage listed. An example of this is the officers' mess, known as 'Duntroon House', which is an imposing stone building, that was actually built as the Campbell family's house before the land was purchased by the Crown.|$|E
2500|$|Ragsdale and Ball, {{now known}} as the founders of the city, began to compete with each other by laying out lots for new {{development}} on their respective land sections. The competition intensified over the desired name for the settlement. Ball believed the word [...] "meridian" [...] was synonymous to [...] "junction," [...] so he, along with the industrial citizens of the city, preferred that name, but the agrarian population of the city preferred [...] "Sowashee," [...] which means [...] "mad river" [...] in a Native American language and is the name of a nearby creek. Also, Ragsdale wanted to name the new settlement Ragsdale City after himself. Ball soon erected a small wooden station house and coerced the owners of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to grant depot privileges to the site. The owners agreed, provided the station was constructed according to their specifications and was furnished at the community's expense. For nearly two years, though, the site was treated as a mere <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> and denied ordinary station accommodations while the expense of station maintenance fell on Ball himself.|$|E

5000|$|Services through Clareville {{started with}} two return weekday mixed trains, an {{arrangement}} that lasted many decades. No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains. [...] As was typically the case for <b>flag</b> <b>stations,</b> trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers and wagons if required to do so.|$|R

60|$|At {{last the}} train came {{that was to}} take our hero to the {{railroad}} station of Camptown Falls. It was merely a <b>flag</b> <b>station,</b> but the conductor said he would stop there for any passenger who might wish to get off. The railroad was a single-track affair, running through the woods {{and across the country}} stretches, and the train consisted of one passenger car and several freights.|$|E
60|$|When he {{got down}} at the <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> his {{annoyance}} returned. If there was any ground for his being sent for, {{he ought to have}} been told, and if there was not, he had been caused a loss of time that could have been well employed. He resolved to tell Lawrence his views upon this as he took the road to the hotel, but stopped with a beating heart when he entered the veranda.|$|E
60|$|The Judge was at {{a meeting}} of the Raisin Growers' Association, and the boys were busy {{organizing}} an athletic club, on the memorable night of Manuel's treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> known as College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between them.|$|E

60|$|Lucy listened. She had {{forgotten}} the train {{for the last few}} minutes, and it seemed to be going fast. The sharp snorting of the mountain engine and rhythmic clang of wheels seemed to indicate that its long climb had not been interrupted. The Montreal express did not stop at the <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> unless the conductor was warned. She felt daunted as she realized that Foster might not have come, and she had not told her mother she had telegraphed for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess we'll {{take our}} chances," [...] said Robertson; and Number Forty panted louder, hurling red sparks aloft as he rushed her at an up-grade. Still, his brows {{contracted}} when, some time later, he beckoned me, and I saw a wide lake draw near with silky drifts racing across its black ice. They also flowed across the track ahead, while beyond it the loom {{of what might}} be a <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> was faintly visible against a driving bank of cloud.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey Thurston, Mrs. Leslie, and Thomas Savine of course, {{could not}} know of this conversation, but the woman was anxious as they rode {{together}} into sight of the little <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> shortly before the Atlantic express was due. When the others dismounted, Thomas Savine, who had been summoned by telegram from Vancouver, remained discreetly behind. It was very cold, darkness was closing down on the deep hollow among the hills, and some little distance up the ascending line, a huge freight locomotive was waiting {{with a string of}} cars behind it in a side track. Thurston pointed to the fan-shaped blaze of the great head lamp.|$|E

6000|$|Mackay {{had started}} before our {{conversation}} was finished, and it cost Boone and {{me a long}} gallop {{to come up with}} him, while it was only by dint of hard riding that we eventually reached the station some hours after the departure of the train. Mackay first of all wired to the stations down the line, and then explained: [...] "That's just a useless duty. Yon man is keen enough to know he might find the troopers waiting for him. He'll leave the cars at the <b>flag</b> <b>station</b> where there's nobody to detain him, and, buying a horse at the first ranch, strike south for the border. It would be desirable that we grip him before he reaches it." ...|$|E
60|$|As they {{approached}} it a harsh clanking and the tolling of a bell rose {{from behind the}} trees, {{and they had to}} wait while a locomotive and a string of freight cars jolted across the trail into a neighboring side track. When the train had passed Mr. Oliver and his companions crossed the rails and entered a desolate <b>flag</b> <b>station,</b> which consisted of a roughly boarded, iron-roofed shack and a big water tank. In front of it was an open space strewn with fir stumps, and beyond the latter three or four frame houses rose among the trees. The door of the shack was shut, and while they stood outside it the sound of an approaching train grew steadily louder and a jet of steam blew noisily from the valve of the locomotive waiting in the side track.|$|E
