5|$|Although the Privy Council is {{primarily}} a British institution, officials <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> Commonwealth realms are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors. However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Governor-General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still accorded the style Right Honourable, but without membership of the Council. Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors. Canada also has its own Privy Council, the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (see below). Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a relict humid karst area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests that the past environment in northwestern Madagascar was also more humid. Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> localities in northwestern Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E

5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but <b>from</b> <b>some</b> <b>other</b> group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
