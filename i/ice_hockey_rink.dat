5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Veidekke and construction cost NOK238 million. Grants were given from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and SINTEF for energy economization. The {{work on the}} hall was concluded on 1 February 1993. It was the 27th indoor <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The pitch is far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink.</b> The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of two halves of 45 minutes each, matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|State {{grants and}} a {{municipal}} guarantee were secured in 1980, with construction {{starting in the}} fall. The arena was built around the existing artificial rink. Because the hall could not be completed {{in time for the}} 1980–81 season, Storhamar was permitted to play the season in the Second Division. Storhamar Ishall became the 11th indoor <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> in Norway when it opened in August 1981. The venue was to be partially financed through renting it out during the summer, including to an annual town fair. These ideas fell through and the municipality was forced to take over the venue.|$|E

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
5|$|The hall cost NOK134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{the plans}} for an indoor arena, {{primarily}} for handball, was launched again, {{but the cost of}} NOK6 million was not able to be financed. Following the work with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the plans resurfaced, this time with an <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> to be the centerpiece. In 1985, Lillehammer Municipal Council accepted an agreement with the Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF), which offered to finance 50% of a new multi-use arena in Lillehammer. The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK65 million. After Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became necessary to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. In June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues to the Stampesletta area, and to put Håkons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial among the politicians, and many councilors voted in support of the originally-planned decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality. Håkons Hall cost NOK238 million and it opened on 1 February 1993. Prior to the Olympics, the power lines across the fields were dug down to give better television images. The bid for the Olympics had also included using Stampesletta for the speed skating events, but with the demands for an indoor venue, it was instead decided to build Vikingskipet in Hamar.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Sonja Henie {{offered to pay}} the cost of {{covering}} the arena with a roof. This {{was at the time}} rejected by the municipality, citing concerns with the venue's architecture being spoiled. However, the lack of a roof placed any event the mercy of the weather, and it gradually became evident that a roof would have to be built. When it was installed in 1971, it was at the cost of the municipality. The stadium was then converted from standing to a seated stands, reducing capacity from 10,000 to under 5,000 spectators. It also saw the removal of the stage. This made it Norway's sixth indoor ice rink. The youth rink, built next to Jordal Amfi, opened in 1989, as the twentieth indoor <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>rink</b> in the country. The same year the venue received a series of minor upgrades, followed up with a new ventilation and lighting system in 1993 and a new audio system in 1994.|$|E
