5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} {{has often}} been compared to the television panel game QI. Both were co-created by Lloyd, several of the Museum's 'curators' and comic guests have appeared regularly on QI, and the QI Elves (QI's research team, who provide hosts Stephen Fry and Sandi Toksvig with live information as required during the programme) provide the research. As a result, some critics consider the radio show to be a spin-off of the TV programme, and some have further ventured that The Museum of Curiosity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as its forerunner. Most reviews of The Museum of Curiosity, however, are positive.|$|E

[...] GameTrailers stated that [...] "another viable challenger has stepped onto the stage."

500|$|The similar {{colouration}} {{may cause}} confusion with Boletus projectellus, but the latter species is usually more robust, {{and has a}} reticulated stipe. [...] Additionally, B.projectellus has the largest spores in the Boletaceae, up to about 30µm in diameter. Another lookalike is Austroboletus gracilis, but this species {{does not have a}} blue bruising reaction, and its pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish. Compared to I.badia, B.subtomentosus fruit bodies have narrower stipes, paler brown, dry caps, and wider pores that do not stain blue on bruising. This latter species <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> to eat. In western North America, I.badia is replaced by the similar B.zelleri, which also grows both on the ground and on rotten wood. The European species Xerocomus bubalinus can be mistaken for I.badia, but it has a paler yellow-brown cap flushed with pinkish-red, and is not sticky when wet.|$|E

Consequence of Sound's Chris Coplan found Jay Z's rap unenthusiastic, but said that Rihanna is as {{emotional}} and invested in her singing as she was on Saturday Night Live. People magazine's Chuck Arnold called the song [...] "another moment in the sun." [...] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin thought that it is a collaboration that [...] "does not go unnoticed". On the critical side, Priya Elan of NME wrote that the song is a [...] "gamble that doesn't pay off".

But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart." [...] Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it [...] "laughable to just plain boring, Hannibal is toothless to the end." [...] David Thomson, writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound, praised the film. [...] "It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun...dirty, naughty and knowing." [...] Thomson does make clear, however, {{he is a great}} fan of director Ridley Scott's work. He adds: [...] "It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved." [...] Variety magazine in its review said [...] "Hannibal <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as Lambs... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E
500|$|... "Ring the Alarm" [...] {{received}} polarized {{responses from}} contemporary music critics, who {{noted that it}} was a marked departure from Knowles' previous material.

The Boston Globe Sarah Rodman noted that it finds Knowles in [...] "full hell-hath-no-fury mode", singing with grit and urgency that feel genuine. A critic of Billboard magazine viewed [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as a memorable release even though he wrote that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as Knowles' 2003 single [...] "Crazy in Love". He praised her distorted vocals and the [...] "ranting assault of a lyric", which she uses to convince her love interest. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] torrid, and wrote that Knowles [...] "sounds positively horrified by the prospect of relinquishing the luxury goodies her boyfriend has bought her". Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone stated that she sings with [...] "enough frantic, quavering intensity to make you believe she really is crazy in love". Marcos Chin of Vibe magazine described [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as [...] "both a sexual invitation and a threat". Darryl Sterdan of Jam! described [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as a [...] "shrill tantrum of green-eyed monsterdom", and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times described it as a [...] "canny display of emotional vulnerability". Tom Breihan of The Village Voice commented that [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] may become Knowles' [...] "You Oughta Know".|$|E
