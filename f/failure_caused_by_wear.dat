40|$|The {{application}} of hard wear-resistant coatings is expanding into various sectors of industry to protect tools and other components from <b>failure</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>wear</b> and corrosion. However, in forming industry {{it is still}} rather an exception than a rule to find coated forming dies. This study has objectives to investigate wear behaviour of P/M Vanadis 6 ledeburitic steel with PVD-TiN and TiCN coatings. The tests were {{carried out in the}} laboratory and industrial process conditions. The obtained results under operating conditions show that the {{application of}} PVD coatings appears as a very effective method for increasing the lifetime and wear resistance of cold stamping dies...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{development}} is now driven by cost, performance, governmental regulations and customer demands. Several {{of the requirements}} have tribological associations. Tribological improvements which consist in lowering friction and improving wear resistance in engines, will {{play a major role}} to increase reliability and life cycle. The components studied here are parts of the valvetrain mechanism of heavy-duty Diesel engines. The injection cam {{is one of the most}} problematic parts of the camshaft, as it is subjected to high pressures from the fuel injector. Lubrication is of significant importance in the prevention of cam <b>failure</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>wear.</b> However, the satisfactory lubrication of the cam and roller contact has proved to be one of the most difficult tribological design challenges to take up. For a lubricated contact, the degree of separation between surfaces has a very strong influence on the type and amount of wear. This degree of separation is termed as specific film thickness; its value provides a measure of the severity of asperities interaction in the lubricated contact. In this report, attention is drawn on the evaluation of oil film thickness in the cam-roller contact, in order to predict regimes of lubrication and thus to identify the probable wear zones of the injection cam. Then, confrontation with experimental results is performed(observation of worn cam surfaces). Future work to achieve is to discover the influence of the different parameters on oil film thickness, by performing a multivariate analysis. The next step will focus on modelling the wear of injection cams, and finally establishing quantified correlations between wear and specific film thickness...|$|E
40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} {{inspection and}} maintenance interval optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often {{inspection and maintenance}} activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on inspection and maintenance interval estimation modeling {{is available in the}} concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown inspection and maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment inspection and maintenance interval without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment inspection and maintenance interval considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal inspection and maintenance interval is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing inspection and maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown inspection and maintenance interval for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an inspection and maintenance interval for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned inspection and maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally <b>failure</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>wear</b> or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective inspection and maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown inspection and maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown inspection and maintenance strategy...|$|E

It was also recommended that the firing mechanism be modified to prevent inadvertent firing of the round during movement of the firing pin from the safe to fire position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board determined that inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and eventual failure of a critical flight control system during flight. The probable cause was stated to be [...] "a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut threads. The thread <b>failure</b> was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> excessive <b>wear</b> resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly".|$|R
40|$|In prognostics it is {{possible}} to apply several approaches with the aim to detect incipient <b>failures,</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> progressive <b>wear,</b> of electromechanical actuators (EMA) in primary flight commands. The anticipation of a failure has to be performed through a correct interpretation of the degradation pattern, so to trig an early alert for maintenance and to properly schedule the servomechanism replacement. This paper proposes a prognostic approach based on the simulated annealing optimization method, able to identify symptoms of degradation before the behavior of the actuator becomes anomalous; friction failures are considered as the case study. The approach is validated through an experimental test bench, resulting in an adequate robustness and a high degree of confidence in the ability to early identify faults, with a low amount of false alarms or not annunciated failure...|$|R
40|$|Ion plating is an ion {{assisted}} or {{glow discharge}} deposition technique, where ions or energetic atoms transfer energy, momentum and charge to the substrate {{and the growing}} film in a manner which can be controlled to favorably modify surface, subsurface chemistry, and microstructure. The glow discharge energizing effects from the initial nucleation stages to the final film growth are discussed. As a result, adherence, coherence, internal stresses, density and morphology of the coatings are significantly improved, over the conventional (nonion-assisted) techniques which in turn favorably affect the surface initiated <b>failures</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> friction, <b>wear,</b> erosion, corrosion and fatigue. Ion plated films because of their graded coating/substrate interface, fine, uniform, densely packed film structure also induce a surface strengthening effect which improved the mechanical properties such as yield, tensile strength and fatigue life. Since a uniform, continuous film can be obtained at lower nominal film thickness, this effect is of great importance in solid film lubrication and in corrosion protection...|$|R

5000|$|On August 9, 2007, Air Moorea Flight 1121 crashed {{shortly after}} {{taking off from}} Temae Airport. The de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter was bound for Tahiti's Faa'a International Airport. The report found that the crash was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the <b>failure</b> of the pitch control cables {{following}} the retraction of the flaps after take-off, which causes significant torque on that aircraft and thus additional pressure on the cables. The <b>failure</b> was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> significant <b>wear</b> {{due to the lack}} of special maintenance and inspections for the stainless-steel cables (which are more subject to wear than their carbon steel counterparts), and exacerbated by the jet-blast of an A340 while the aircraft was parked. Another contributory cause for the crash were found to be the lack of pilot training for loss of pitch control. [...] All 19 passengers and the sole crew member died. Amongst those 19 passengers were two European Union officials.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate if a capacitive sensor could be used to detect indications of failure in lumbar disc replacements. Lumbar disc replacement <b>failure</b> is often <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>wear</b> of the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene layer of the disc replacement. Wear is a problem that is not generally detectable until the patient experiences pain at which point total failure of the disc replacement is likely. The ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene layer of the disc replacement was modeled and tested under various load and wear conditions to determine if these conditions, which have been linked to potential failure of the replacement, elicited a change in capacitance readings. The wear conditions generally resulted in increased capacitance readings, while the high load situations resulted in decreased capacitance readings. It was concluded that a capacitive sensor is capable of predicting the potential failure of a lumbar disc replacement as evidenced by changes in capacitance readings. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mo-based {{composites}} with Al 2 O 3 particles {{were developed}} {{in order to enhance}} the wear resistance of molybdenum alloys. Using Al 2 O 3 power and pure Mo power as raw materials, the Molybdenum powders mixed with Al 2 O 3 particles were prepared using planetary ball mill. And then the Mo-based composites with 3 - 10 vol. % Alumina were prepared by compaction and sintering at 1840 °C. The morphology of the Molybdenum powder and microstructure of the composites were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The micro-hardness, density and wear property of composites were researched. The results show that the microstructure of composites is composed of α-Al 2 O 3 particles and Molybdenum matrix. With the increase of Alumina content, the microhardness of Molybdenum matrix increases, and the density first increases and then decreases. The friction coefficient of composite is scarcely affected by the alumina content. While the wear resistance of the composites rises with the increase of Alumina content. The <b>wear</b> <b>failure</b> is <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> abrasive <b>wear</b> characterized <b>by</b> obvious plow furrow and abrasive dust on the worn surface...|$|R
5000|$|Following the race, Sebastian Vettel voiced harsh {{criticism}} of tyre supplier Pirelli, concerning {{not only his}} own but also Nico Rosberg's tyre failure on Friday. He was quoted saying: [...] "I {{think it is a}} sort of thing that keeps going around and no-one mentions. It it is unacceptable. If Nico tells us he did not go off the track, he didn't go off the track, why should he lie to us? It is the same with me, I didn't go off the track - it is out of the blue the tyre exploded ...." [...] He saw the safety of the drivers at risks, asserting that [...] "if it happens 200 metres earlier, I am not standing here now." [...] Pirelli's Motorsport Director Paul Hembery reacted to Vettel's accusations by saying: [...] "I am not going to criticise Sebastian. It is a hot moment and I don't want to enter into a war of words over that - it is pointless for everybody. We were concerned when we saw the number of laps that were going to be done. Nobody really suggested {{they were going to do}} a one-stop race and it was a bit of a surprise - if anything people were talking about doing three stops rather than two." [...] Nico Rosberg however backed up his compatriot Vettel, telling the press: [...] "The exploding tyres is poor. It shouldn't happen. That it keeps on happening in other categories as well and with me on Friday. Both of us were so lucky. If it had happened a couple of metres later or earlier, we would have one of the biggest shunts ever. They need to figure out something to make it safer." [...] He also called for immediate action considering the [...] - the race following Spa-Francorchamps - due to its nature as the fastest race of the year. Pirelli reacted by demanding a maximum stint length for their tyres, a suggestion the company had already put in at the end of [...] The day after the race, Pirelli announced that they had found cuts on other tyres from other teams, mainly on the rear tyres, and that they were still searching for the cause of the damages. However, the company reasserted their stance that while Rosberg's <b>failure</b> was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> external damage, Vettel's was due to [...] "pure wear". Vettel received additional support from Coulthard, who wrote that Vettel was [...] "right to tackle Pirelli" [...] over the issue of tyres, as well as Coulthard's former teammate Mika Häkkinen. Vettel once again defended the team's decision to try a one-stop race on the Tuesday after the race, saying: [...] "Our strategy was never risky, at any point. The team is not to blame." [...] When the tyre supplier released the findings of their own investigation into the matter, the company needed to overturn their claim that the <b>failure</b> was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>wear,</b> since the report proved that the damage to Vettel's tyre was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> debris.|$|R
