It was too pale--greys flowing into lavenders, and one star or a white gull suspended just so--too pale as usual.

She knows that a song like 'Bellyache' is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> more sideways glances than Top 40 airplay, and that's fine with her." [...] Estelle Tang of Elle labeled it a [...] "banger about bad decisions".
