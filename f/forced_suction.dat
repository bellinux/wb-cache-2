40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{performance}} of <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomy {{was not reported}} {{for the treatment of}} acute basilar artery occlusion. This study compared revascularization performance between intra-arterial fibrinolytic treatment and <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomy with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Fifty-seven patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with intra-arterial fibrinolysis (n 25) or <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomy (n 32). Baseline characteristics, successful revascularization rate, and clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, the frequency of patients receiving intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, and mean time interval between symptom onset and femoral puncture did not differ between groups. The <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomy group had a shorter procedure duration (75. 5 minutes versus 113. 3 minutes, P. 016) and higher successful revascularization rate (88 % versus 60 %, P. 017) than the fibrinolysis group. Fair outcome, indicated by a modified Rankin Scale 0 – 3, at 3 months was achieved in 34 % of patients undergoing <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomy and 8 %of patients undergoing fibrinolysis (P. 019), and themortality rate was significantly higher in the fibrinolysis group (25 % versus 68 %, P. 001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified the <b>forced</b> arterial <b>suction</b> thrombectomymethod as an independent predictor of fair outcomewith adjustment for age, sex, initial NIHSS score, and the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (odds ratio, 7. 768; 95 % CI, 1. 246 – 48. 416; P. 028) ...|$|R

40|$|Plate anchor {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of anchors used in the construction and maintenance work of various on-land and offshore structures. An accurate estimation of the uplift capacity of anchor foundations is necessary for an economical design as well as for the safety and stability of structures. This paper outlines the effect of shape of anchor plates on their breakout capacity, through a series of model tests. Both shallow and deep anchor behaviours were investigated under conditions developing <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> and without <b>suction</b> <b>force.</b> The results of these tests are presented in terms of load-displacement behaviour, variation of breakout factors (with and without <b>suction</b> <b>force)</b> with depth of embedment, the critical embedment depth of anchors and variation of <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> with embedment ratio. Further, the variations of breakout factor ratio with aspect ratio and embedment ratio are reported.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Loess is {{characterized}} by an open structure of fine volcanic sand and silt particles with connecting clay bridges and buttresses at contacts. At low moisture content, the formation presents high stiffness and shear strength. When the moisture content increases, the soil structure undergoes a sudden volume collapse. This experimental study of Argentinean loess includes laboratory tests (index properties, shear wave velocity, permittivity and conductivity) and field tests (CPT, SPT and down-hole seismic). Micro-level analytical models of electrical <b>forces,</b> <b>suction</b> and cementation are developed to gain insight into the observed behavior. It is shown that geophysical methods present significant advantages that are complementary to standard field measurements for the characterization of loess deposits. ...|$|R

30|$|The “Planar Walker” (Fig.  2 a) uses a <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> {{to stick}} to a wall. Many other wall {{climbing}} robots also employ this method [8 – 10]. Such robots are fitted with a suction cup to stick their body to the wall. Generally, these cups include a controllable vacuum motor. Robots using <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> can move freely on wall surfaces, and heavy devices can be mounted on the robot when the <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> is sufficiently strong. However, this mechanism has several drawbacks for our application. Robots that employ this mechanism require a continuous energy supply to maintain the robot’s adhered status. Moreover, estimation of a robot’s position is not easy; without additional sensors, this estimation includes errors, and these errors accumulate according to increments in moving distance.|$|R
50|$|Slab <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} plate tectonic driving <b>forces.</b> Slab <b>suction</b> occurs when a subducting slab drives flow in the nearby mantle. This flow then exerts shear {{tractions}} on nearby plates. This driving force is important when the slabs (or portions thereof) are not strongly attached to the rest of their respective tectonic plate. They cause both the subducting and overriding plate to move {{in the direction of the}} subduction zone. Slab suction is the weakest of the three major forces involved in plate motion, the others being slab pull, the strongest, and ridge push.|$|R
40|$|Leaking {{in water}} pipe is a {{critical}} issue in Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait where water is scarce. In-pipe robots can be dispatched to discover the network and inspect the inner surface of the pipe. This thesis describes the design and characterization of suction pads for in-pipe robots. The suction cups are made of hyperelastic materials that contain air channels inside. Instead of using conventional suction technique that is prone to leaking and loosing adhesion <b>force,</b> the <b>suction</b> cup is actuated by compressed air or liquid, which deforms the geometry of the cup to achieve suction. In order to verify the geometry changes during actuation, a uniaxial tension test was done on the elastic material used to acquire the material properties and the suction cup designs were then simulated using FEA in ABAQUS. Next, prototypes were designed in SolidWorks and fabricated using soft lithography techniques. To measure the <b>suction</b> <b>force,</b> pressure measurements were taken both inside the prototype channels and underneath the suction cup. Results show that a Positive Pressure Actuated Suction-cup (PPAS) of diameter forty millimeters can achieve <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> up to 68 N.

40|$|Summary. -Camber {{and twist}} {{is applied to}} the problem of {{reducing}} the drag due to incidence, of thin triangular or swept-back wings, at supersonic speeds, with subsonic leading edges and supersonic or sonic trailing edges. Two cases are considered: (i) with leading-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> ignored, (ii) with leading-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> included. It is found that twist, especially towards the wing tips, is more effective in reducing drag, for given lift, for the larger values of tan yjtan u, where y is the semi-apex-angle and ft is the Mach angle, and that camber is more effective for the smaller values, though, in general, the best results are obtained by a suitable combination of camber and twist. For triangular wings, with suction ignored, the maximum percentage drag reduction varies from about 10 per cent (for sonic leading edges) to 50 per cent (for very slender plan-forms) and, if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are included, from zero (for very slender plan-forms) to about 10 per cent (when the leading edges are sonic). The effect of the swept-back trailing edge is, in general, to increase the maximum percentage drag reduction for given lift if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are ignored; but to decrease the maximum reduction for smaller values of tan yjtan ft, and to increase the maximum reduction for values of tan yjtan ft near to one, if <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> are included. [...] _~ 1.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} works in Fluid Dynamics {{at the edge of the}} 19 th century was a short paper [130] written by Henry Selby Hele-Shaw (1854 – 1941). There Hele-Shaw first described his famous cell that became a subject of deep investigation only more than 50 years later. A Hele-Shaw cell is a device for investigating two-dimensional flow of a viscous fluid in a narrow gap between two parallel plates. This cell is the simplest system in which multi-dimensional convection is present. Probably the most important characteristic of flows in such a cell is that when the Reynolds number based on gap width is sufficiently small, the Navier-Stokes equations averaged over the gap reduce to a linear relation similar to Darcy’s law and then to a Laplace equation for pressure. Different driving mechanisms can be considered, such as surface tension or external <b>forces</b> (<b>suction,</b> injection). Through the similarity in the governing equations, Hele-Shaw flows are particularly useful for visualization of saturated flows in porous media, assuming they are slow enough to be governed by Darcy’s low. Nowadays, the Hele-Shaw cell i...|$|R

The method is applicable to both subsonic and supersonic flow. It is shown that the improved Woodward panel method is capable of accurately predicting leading-edge and side-edge <b>suction</b> <b>forces</b> in subsonic and supersonic flow. Therefore, the method can be used not only to predict the vortex lift of complex planforms through the method of suction analogy, but also to calculate some lateral-directional stability derivatives...|$|R

The objective of pre-implaiitation diagnosis would be to sample a minimal amount of cellular material of the conceptus for diagnosis prior to transfer.

40|$|Background: Disposable tonometers are {{increasingly}} being adopted partly because of concerns over the transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and partly for convenience. Recently, we have found one such tonometer (Tonojet by Luneau Ophthalmologie, France) underestimated the intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods: We hypothesized that this underestimation {{was caused by a}} difference in the surface property of the tonometers. A tensiometer was used to measure the <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> resulting from interfacial tension between a solution of lignocaine and fluorescein and the tonometers. Results: The results showed that the <b>suction</b> <b>force</b> was significantly greater for the Goldmann compared to the Tonojet. Conclusions: The magnitude of this force was too small to account for the difference in IOP measurements. The Tonojet was less hydrophilic than the Goldmann, and the contact angle of the fluid was therefore greater. For a given tear film, less hydrophilic tonometers will tend to have thicker mires, and this may lead to underestimation of the IOP. When such disposable tonometers are used, it is recommended care should be taken to reject readings from thick mires. © Springer-Verlag 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
