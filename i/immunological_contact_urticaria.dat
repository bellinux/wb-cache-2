40|$|Contact urticaria, is {{characterized}} by an urticarial wheal-and-flare reaction {{at the site of}} contact by an allergen. <b>Immunological</b> <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria,</b> while less common than non-immunological contact urticaria, has more potentially serious consequences, and therefore, its recognition and treatment is important. <b>Immunological</b> <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> is a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Potential complications include organ system involvement other than skin and even anaphylaxis and death. A vast majority of <b>immunological</b> <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> is work-related.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of severe <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> with {{systemic}} involvement resembling an anaphylactic reaction, following {{the application of a}} topical corticosteroid. This was caused by hexylene glycol, an excipient in the formulation. Glycols are widely used in cosmetics, foods and topical and systemic drugs. In particular, glycols are present in many topical drugs used by dermatologists.

40|$|In most cases, <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> is {{acute and}} is {{diagnosed}} straightforward; indeed it appears {{immediately after the}} application of the urticariogen(s) and disappears promptly after removal of the contact. On some rare occasions, <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> is chronic for two main reasons: sometimes, it is provoked by an unknown urticariogen; in other cases, {{it is one of the}} clinical signs of protein contact dermatitis. In both situations, diagnostic procedures to be applied are of prime importance; treatment is submitted to the elimination of the responsible urticariogen. Acute and chronic varieties of <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> can be subdivided into two categories: immunological and non-immunological.

40|$|Fish is {{a common}} cause of food allergy. The {{reactions}} usually occur after its ingestion. In most immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions, the allergens are gastroresistant and heat-stable proteins of low molecularweight (parvalbumin). On the other hand, isolated <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> following the handling of raw fish but without symptoms after its ingestion was found among cooks and professional fish handlers. In these cases, the fish allergens are gastrosensitive and thermolabile, {{as demonstrated by the}} decrease in the diameter of the wheal in the skin-prick test using cooked fish.

40|$|In {{the group}} of <b>urticaria,</b> <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> {{syndrome}} is a particular variety. In these patients, appearance of typical skin lesions is preceded by contact of the skin and mucous membranes with various inhaled allergens, nutrients or contact details. Furthermore, symptoms connected with <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> syndrome are characterized by gradual, stepwise waveform, which can be easily generalized – patients may develop systemic symptoms {{similar to those found}} in the angioedema, asthma or anaphylactic shock. It is an attribute of <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> syndrome in the course of which potentially life-threatening symptoms may develop after contact of the skin with the allergen. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood; both immunological and non-immunological mechanisms are taken into account, therefore <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> syndrome can be classified into two categories – allergic and non-allergic. An intriguing phenomenon seems to be the immediate reaction after exposure to low molecular weight allergens – haptens, such as metals, which are usually the cause of delayed allergic reactions. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation indicating a coincidence of the onset of allergy with contract with allergen, and helpful exposure tests. Treatment consists of supportive antihistamines and corticosteroids – locally and systemically. In the case of anaphylaxis, appropriate treatment intensification of the integration of pressor amines and hydration is necessary. It is also regarded that prevention is advisable, which consists of relevant information to avoid situations connect...|$|R
40|$|Background: There have {{recently}} been reports suggesting that sensitization to food allergens may occur outside the intestinal tract, especially through the skin. To clarify the role of epicutaneous sensitization in food allergy, we investigated the clinical characteristics of adult patients with food allergies preceded by <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> due to the same foods. Methods: We investigated clinical characteristics of 15 patients (20 – 51 years of age; 5 men and 10 women), who had food allergies preceded by <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria.</b> Results: Fourteen patients were <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> due to the causative foods during occupationally cooking, whereas 1 patient during face pack. In the occupational group, causative foods included rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables, fish, shrimp and cuttlefish; in the fresh cucumber paste case the cause was cucumber. In the 15 patients, the causative foods were fresh, not processed, and were tolerated by most (9 / 15, 60 %) after heating. Regarding to symptoms after ingestion of the causative foods, the most frequently induced symptoms was oral symptoms (14 / 15, 93. 3 %), followed by urticaria (4 / 15, 26. 7 %), abdominal symptoms (3 / 15, 20 %). The duration between the start of jobs or face pack, and the onset of <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> was from 1 month to 19 years (mean, 8. 7 years). The duration between the onset of <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> and the onset of food allergy was from {{a few weeks to}} 6 years (mean, 11 months). One sushi cook experienced severe anaphylactic shock after ingestion of fish. In the occupational group, 13 of 15 patients (86. 7 %) had atopic dermatitis or hand eczema, indicating that the impaired skin barrier might be a risk for food allergies induced by epicutaneous sensitization. Conclusions: Epicutaneous sensitization of foods could induce food allergy under occupational cooking and skin-care treatment with foods in adults...|$|R

To investigate these mediators, three nurses with <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> syndrome caused by exposure to cefotiam hydrochloride (CTM), and five normal controls were evaluated. IgE antibodies specific for CTM were detected by the radioallergosorbent technique (RAST). In response to CTM, cytokines were released from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and sulfidoleukotrienes were released from peripheral blood leukocytes. RAST counts in the three nurses with this syndrome exceeded those in the normal controls. The stimulation index of the leukotrienes released from the peripheral blood leukocytes in response to CTM also exceeded those in the normal controls. Higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were also detected in the supernatant of the patients' PBMC.

A wheal-and-flare response is a skin eruption that may follow injury or injection of an antigen. It is characterized by swelling and redness caused by a release of histamine. The reaction usually occurs in three stages, beginning {{with the appearance of}} an erythematous area at the site of injury, followed by development of a flare surrounding the site; finally a wheal forms at the site as fluid leaks under the skin from surrounding capillaries. CUS has been categorized as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with IgE (a type of anti-body) playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Investigations dealing with CUS seem to suggest that a percentage of <b>urticarias</b> encompass a <b>contact</b> mechanism.|$|R

Objective In this study we clarify the different occupational dermatoses on hands and forearms among veterinarians, using data collected in different dermatological patch-test expert centres in Belgium and the Netherlands. Methods Instead of questioning veterinarians themselves, which has been done in different studies in the past, we contacted dermatologists in Belgium and the Netherlands, questioning them about their experiences with dermatoses among veterinarians. Results Seven dermatologists described a total of 58 veterinarians. Infectious dermatoses were described in 12 cases (20. 7 %). The non-infectious dermatoses (46 cases, 79. 3 %) can be classified as <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> and as irritant or allergic contact dermatitis.

40|$|Abstract: Acid {{anhydrides}} are low-molecular weight chemicals {{known to}} cause respiratory irritancy and allergy. Skin allergy has on rare occasions been reported. A total of 3 subjects with occupational exposure to methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) from an epoxy resin system were studied to evaluate {{the nature of their}} reported skin and nose complaints (work-related anamnesis, specific IgE, <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> examinations, and ambient monitoring). Using a Pharmacia CAP system with a HHPA human serum albumin conjugate, specific IgE antibody was detected in serum from 1 (33. 3 %) out of the 3 workers. One unsensitized worker displayed nasal pain and rhinorrhea only when loading liquid epoxy resins into the pouring-machine (2. 2 mg MHHPA/m 3 and 1. 2 mg HHPA/m 3), probably being an irritant reaction. Two workers had work-related symptoms at relatively low levels of exposure (geometric mean 32 – 103 µg MHHPA/m 3 and 18 – 59 µg HHPA/m 3); one complained of only rhinitis, and the other was sensitized against HHPA and displayed both rhinitis and <b>contact</b> <b>urticaria</b> (the face and neck). The worker’s skin symptoms were evidently due to airborne contact, since she had not had any skin contact with liquid epoxy resin or mixtures of MHHPA and HHPA. These urticaria symptoms were confirmed by a 20 -min closed patch test for MHHPA, but not by that for HHPA. The causative agent was considered to be MHHPA, although the specific IgE determination to MHHPA was not performed...|$|R
