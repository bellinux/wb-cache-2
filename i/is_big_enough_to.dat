With the number of students per batch increasing every year, the need to expand this campus will become more serious in the near future.|$|E

Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity has every encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E

An E8 gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons. To account for the 248 fermions in the lowest multiplet of E8, these would either have to include anti-particles (and so have baryogenesis), have new undiscovered particles, or have gravity-like (spin connection) bosons affecting elements of the particles spin direction. Each of these possess theoretical problems.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the rank}} and file had left, Blamey {{addressed}} the officers. He questioned whether they were worthy of their men, and told them they must improve. Potts was initially dismissive about Blamey's address, when informed about it by Major Albert Caro. He passed on the news in a letter to Dawn; [...] "... apparently most of the troops take the speech as a colossal joke against the speaker..." [...] He did however write to Allen asking him to [...] "take the necessary action" [...] regarding Blamey's remarks. By the New Year he had been given further details and was enraged. Again writing to his wife; [...] "Hugh sent me a precis of his (T's) speech to the old team and to the officers. Hells Bells, it was a cowardly bit of work and untrue in every detail.

2500|$|... "The {{outbreak}} of war revivified the vague ideas of revolution {{which had been}} floating about {{in the mind of}} young Bengal for the last ten years and the hopes of those who had throughout been waiting for the opportunity, and the possibility of a successful revolt seemed imminent," [...] wrote Nixon. [...] "It was probably some time in September 1914 that Jatin Mukherjee came to Calcutta in order to take such steps as England’s participation in a war with Germany seemed to call for in this direction.". Judging the time ripe for them to make full preparations for a revolution, Jatin’s men undertook taxi-cab robberies to provide funds for this purpose, as described in the Rowlatt Report. [...] Hence, on 26 August 1914, Shrish Chandra Mitra (Habu), one of his loyal associates, smuggled fifty Mauser pistols and forty-six thousand cartridges from the Rodda (arms dealers) in Kolkata, handed them over to Atul, before disappearing for good. Jatin Mukherjee distributed these dreadful arms to various units. Conceived by Jatin, as does a skilful stage manager, Atul chalked out a series of daring overt acts under the immediate leadership of Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy: these are all duly catalogued in the Rowlatt Report. Successive emissaries returned from Europe and America with the good news of the arrival of arms obtained from German authorities by the Berlin Committee. Balasore was chosen by Germany to land a shipment. Jatin with a handful of associates took shelter there. Then Atul dispatched Harikumar Chakravarti, Dr Jatin Ghoshal, Satish Chakravarti and a batch of workers with boats, rifles and other requisites to the other selected port at Raymangal in the Sundarbans. When information came that the Police had discovered Jatin's hideout in Balasore, Naren Ghose Chaudhury proposed spontaneously to rush to the spot for a showdown; Jadugopal Mukherjee objected: [...] "Dada <b>is</b> <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> look after himself. Let us disperse." [...] Atul was stunned by this cynical order. After the failure of the Indo-German conspiracy and after Jatin’s untimely death, disheartened Atul and [...] other Jugantar leaders went underground in 1915, remaining so for about seven years. Even then, for several years, the revolutionaries entertained the hope of smuggling arms for an insurrection. In June 1916, Atul sent through Ananta Haldar a letter for Bhavabhushan Mitra at Deoghar, [...] "who was one of the trusted men of the party. Both Ananta and Bhava Bhushan were dealt with under the Defence Rules and interned in Bengal." [...] (Sealy, p24). [...] In the teeth of sporadic Police attempts to arrest them, once, in Chandernagore, while nursing [...] Charu Ghose, [...] Atul with the ailing co-worker on his shoulders, scaled the hospital wall. Dr Govindin, the Civil Surgeon, narrated this to Bhupendrakumar Datta. According to Nixon: [...] "Jatin Mukherjee had at this time gone to Balasore, and Atul Ghosh was a big figure in the arrangement for these outrages." [...] In July 1916, [...] "Atul Ghosh was still the prompting spirit of all these gangs, and in the Barisal party, too, he seems to have wielded some influence.".|$|E
