30|$|It {{is clearly}} {{observed}} in the study that the calculated <b>effective</b> <b>weights</b> for each parameter are not equal to the theoretical weight assigned in DRASTIC method.

It assists in the work of: steering gear, pitch propellers, watertight doors, cargo hatch covers, cargo and mooring winches, deck cranes, stern ramps etc. The damage caused by transient flows (which include among others water hammer) are often impossible to repair at sea.

The presented study compares the results of research on the impact of a simplified way of modeling the hydraulic resistance and simplified <b>effective</b> <b>weighting</b> functions build of two and three-terms on the estimated results of the pressure changes.

Consistency and stability of such a system of currency baskets are investigated through an application of the Frobenius-Perron Theorem on semipositive square matrices. It is established that devaluations preserve (while sufficiently large revaluations undermine) these properties. This asymmetry is caused by the use of arithmetic baskets which do not preserve <b>effective</b> <b>weights</b> when exchange rates differ from their base settings. 1...|$|R

50|$|Throw-weight is {{a measure}} of the <b>effective</b> <b>weight</b> of {{ballistic}} missile payloads. It is measured in kilograms or tonnes. Throw-weight equals the total weight of a missile's warheads, reentry vehicles, self-contained dispensing mechanisms, penetration aids, and missile guidance systems—generally all components except for the launch rocket booster and launch fuel. While throw-weight may refer to any type of warhead, in normal modern usage it almost exclusively refers to nuclear or thermonuclear payloads. It was once also a consideration in the design of naval ships and the number/size of guns they carried.|$|E

As the tractor travels the course, the weights are pushed forward of the sled's axles, pushing {{the front of the}} sled into the ground, {{synthetically}} creating a gain in weight until the tractor is no longer able to overcome the force of friction. Most sleds have grouser bars that act like teeth and dig into the soil to stop the sled.|$|E

The method classifies basic human body activities, such as walking, running, gymnastic exercises and others. Applying Burt-Adelson Pyramid approach, the system extracts useful features consisting of multi-resoutional optical flows. This paper also reports coarseness limit of spatial resolution of optical flow for activity recognition; optical flows of 8 sub-areas covering {{the human body}} area are minimum requirement for the recognition. Also, the experiment examines <b>effective</b> <b>weighting</b> of multi-resoutional feature components.

In this paper a clear link is established between the selec-tion of effective weightings and the approximately isotropic shrinkage that the distribution of acoustic cepstral features undergo {{in the presence of}} additive noise. An elucidation of the theoretical relationship between the cepstral shrinkage and the variance of the HMM audio log-likelihoods is then explored. 1...|$|R
50|$|Copycat's {{architecture}} is tripartite, {{consisting of a}} slipnet, a working area (also called workspace, similar to blackboard systems), and the coderack (with the codelets). The slipnet is a network composed of nodes, which represent permanent concepts, and weighted links, which are relations, between them. It differs from traditional semantic networks as the <b>effective</b> <b>weight</b> associated with a particular link may vary through time according to the activation level of specific concepts (nodes). The codelets build structures in the working area and modify activations in the slipnet accordingly (bottom-up processes), and {{the current state of}} slipnet determines probabilistically which codelets must be run (top-down influences).|$|E

50|$|Railcar movers {{are fairly}} lightweight, {{so in order}} to gain more {{traction}} some models transfer weight from the car they are hauling onto their own wheels to increase their <b>effective</b> <b>weight.</b> These models use steel wheels on steel rail, much like a locomotive, which provides a more consistent traction among wider variety of conditions. The steel wheels also last far longer than rubber tires and overall cost less to operate. In Australia, construction equipment such as loaders and telehanders are converted to shunting use and on these machines, the boom lift is used to transfer weight from the car to the drive wheels. In Europe, trucks (lorries) fitted with railway wheels and couplings are used as rail car movers (often called towing or shunting vehicles).|$|E

A WaterWheel user can put up to 200 pounds (90 kg) {{of water in the}} [...] "wheel", a broad drum with round edges and a steel handle, transforming the water to an <b>effective</b> <b>weight</b> of approximately 22 pounds (10 kg).

By reducing the number of daily trips needed to collect water, the WaterWheel allows women and children in developing countries to devote more time and energy to educational and economic activities. In addition, the WaterWheel is a sustainable solution for water transportation. It does not require any energy or other supplies in order to operate. It also does not require repairs over its 10-15 year life.|$|E
50|$|The {{downhole}} fluid {{pressures are}} controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the hydrostatic pressure {{provided by the}} mud column. Should {{the balance of the}} drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the casing), and/or inside the drill pipe. This is commonly called a kick. Ideally, mechanical barriers such as blowout preventers (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the blow-out preventer), a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the <b>effective</b> <b>weight</b> of the fluid.|$|E

Conventional weighting networks are shown to be ineffective against such Doppler sidelobes structures. Thus an innovative method is introduced to design <b>effective</b> <b>weighting</b> networks based on the solution of a constrained optimization problem. The performed analysis against both simulated and real data demonstrates that the proposed technique allows a significant improvement in terms of Peak to Sidelobes Ratio thus making the considered waveform more attractive for passive local area surveillance...|$|R
