5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define their sexuality. However, {{a survey by the}} UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> bisexual, and the ONS suggests that this is in line with other surveys showing the number between 0.3% and 3%. Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same-sex households, such as those performed by the U.S. census, and estimates of total gay, lesbian, or bisexual population by the UK government. However, polls in Australia have recorded a range of self-identified lesbian or bisexual women from 1.3% to 2.2% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E

5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women. Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly <b>gay</b> <b>or</b> lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E
