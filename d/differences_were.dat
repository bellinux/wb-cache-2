5|$|Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, {{while the}} rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Class <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> not {{as great}} in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more {{permanently}} in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites.

Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{study was}} {{published}} that examined genetic variation among five Indian equine breeds—the Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, Bhutia, and Zanskari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest genetic distance from the Marwari, and a much closer genetic distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only genetic, but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental adaptability. The physical <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended at least in part from the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E
5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found between mammoths and elephants, which affect {{the sequence of}} more than 1,600 proteins. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> noted in genes {{for a number of}} aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Morchella sextelata is morphologically {{indistinguishable from}} several other morel {{species in the}} M.elata clade, {{including}} M.septimelata, M.brunnea, M.angusticeps, and M.septentrionalis. M.septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M.brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M.angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M.septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44°N northward) in eastern North America. M.septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M.sextelata.

The winner of the stage received one point, the second rider two points, et cetera. After the eighth stage, only 16 cyclists were remaining, and the results from the first eight stages were recalculated, with only the remaining cyclists, and the points were redistributed among the remaining riders in accordance with their positions in those stages.|$|E
