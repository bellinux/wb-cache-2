2500|$|The [...] "one {{year out}} of high school" [...] {{requirement}} is {{in addition to the}} age requirement. For example, although O. J. Mayo turned 19 in November 2006, six months before his high school graduation, he was not <b>eligible</b> <b>until</b> the 2008 draft, a year after his high school class graduated. Stern stated the rules were business-related and not a [...] "social program", citing the need to see players perform against higher competition before they are evaluated for valuable draft picks. The rule effectively mandated that players spend at least one year in college. High school players who would otherwise have jumped directly into the NBA were instead playing in college for the required year before leaving and entering the draft—a phenomenon known as one and done. Some colleges have embraced this rule to their advantage, notably the University of Kentucky, among others. Many of their players have played the one mandatory year, leaving after their freshman season to enter the draft. The NBA Development League is one alternative to college. Players can earn five-figure salaries, but the level of competition is possibly lower than in the Division I level in college. Some players, most notably Brandon Jennings, have also played overseas in lieu of college.|$|E
