40|$|Background: Septins {{belong to}} the GTPase {{superclass}} of proteins and have been functionally implicated in cytokinesis {{and the maintenance of}} cellular morphology. They are found in all eukaryotes, except in plants. In mammals, 14 septins have been described that can be divided into four groups. It has been shown that mammalian septins can engage in homo- and heterooligomeric assemblies, in the form of filaments, which have as a basic unit a hetero-trimeric core. In addition, it has been speculated that the septin filaments may serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of additional proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with human septins 1 - 10, which include representatives of all four septin groups. Among the interactors detected, we found predominantly other septins, confirming the tendency of septins to engage in the formation of homo- and heteropolymeric filaments. Conclusions/Significance: If we take as reference the reported arrangement of the septins 2, 6 and 7 within the <b>heterofilament,</b> (7 - 6 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 7), we note {{that the majority of the}} observed interactions respect the ""group rule"", i. e. members of the same group (e. g. 6, 8, 10 and 11) can replace each other in the specific position along the <b>heterofilament.</b> Septins of the SEPT 6 group preferentially interacted with septins of the SEPT 2 group (p< 0. 001), SEPT 3 group (p< 0. 001) and SEPT 7 group (p< 0. 001). SEPT 2 type septins preferentially interacted with septins of the SEPT 6 group (p< 0. 001) aside from being the only septin group which interacted with members of its own group. Finally, septins of the SEPT 3 group interacted preferentially with septins of the SEPT 7 group (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, we found non-septin interactors which can be functionally attributed to a variety of different cellular activities, including: ubiquitin/sumoylation cycles, microtubular transport and motor activities, cell division and the cell cycle, cell motility, protein phosphorylation/signaling, endocytosis, and apoptosis.

40|$|The {{human genome}} codes for 13 {{members of a}} family of filamentforming GTP-binding {{proteins}} known as septins. These have been divided into four different subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity. The differences between the subgroups are believed to control their correct assembly into <b>heterofilaments</b> which have specific roles in membrane remodelling events. Many different combinations of the 13 proteins are theoretically possible and it is therefore important to understand the structural basis of specific filament assembly. However, three-dimensional structures are currently available for only three of the four subgroups. In the present study we describe the crystal structure of a construct of human SEPT 3 which belongs to the outstanding subgroup. This construct (SEPT 3 -GC), which includes the GTP-binding and C-terminal domains, purifies as a nucleotide-free monomer, allowing for its characterization in terms of GTP-binding and hydrolysis. In the crystal structure, SEPT 3 -GC forms foreshortened filaments which employ the same NC and G interfaces observed in the heterotrimeric complex of human septins 2, 6 and 7, reinforcing the notion of ‘promiscuous’ interactions described previously. In the present study we describe these two interfaces and relate the structure to its tendency to form monomers and its efficiency in the hydrolysis of GTP. The relevance of these results is emphasized by the fact that septins from the SEPT 3 subgroup may be important determinants of polymerization by occupying the terminal position in octameric units which themselves form the building blocks of at least some <b>heterofilaments.</b> FAPESP (08 / 58316 - 5, 06 / 57573 - 9, 08 / 57910 - 0, 98 / 14138 - 2) CNPq (573607 / 2008 - 7) CAPE...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{identified a}} novel protein called syncoilin, a putative intermediate filament protein that interacts with alpha-dystrobrevin, {{a member of}} the dystrophin-associated protein complex. Syncoilin is found at the neuromuscular junction, sarcolemma, and Z-lines and is thought to be important for muscle fiber integrity. Based on the similar protein structure and cellular localization of syncoilin and desmin, we proposed that these proteins interact in vivo. The data presented confirm an interaction between syncoilin and desmin and demonstrate their co-localization in skeletal muscle. Intriguingly, whereas these proteins interact, COS- 7 cell expression studies show that desmin and syncoilin do not assemble into <b>heterofilaments.</b> Furthermore, fractionation assay and immunofluorescence study of H 2 K myoblasts and myotubes suggest that, unlike typical intermediate filament proteins, syncoilin does not participate in filament formation with any protein. However, it is possible that syncoilin is involved in the anchoring of the desmin intermediate filament network at the sarcolemma and the neuromuscular junction. This interaction is likely to be important for maintaining muscle fiber integrity and may also link the dystrophin-associated protein complex to the cytoskeleton. The dysfunction or absence of syncoilin may result in the disruption of the intermediate filament network leading to muscle necrosis. Syncoilin is therefore an ideal candidate gene for muscular dystrophies and desmin-related myopathies...|$|R
