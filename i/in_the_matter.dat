5|$|Brooks {{then took}} a {{petition}} to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873 and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of quo warranto, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> and dismissed the case. They gave a lengthy explanation {{as to why the}} General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.|$|E

5|$|In 1789 Marshall {{was elected}} again to a {{convention}} to consider separation from Virginia. After Kentucky's separation from Virginia in 1792, {{he was elected}} to represent Woodford County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. The most notable piece of legislation he authored was an act that simplified the classification and taxation of land. He was reelected to his position in 1794. He opposed allocating men or supplies for George Rogers Clark's proposed attack upon the Spanish at New Orleans. The attack was promoted by Edmond-Charles Genêt, and Marshall accused sitting governor Isaac Shelby of complicity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

Henry thus resolved to bully the priests.|$|E

In their view, testing was necessary if the UK nuclear program were {{to continue to}} develop.

5|$|The Daruvar Agreement, {{mediated}} {{by the head of}} the United Nations (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, was negotiated in secrecy. When the central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the arrangement, the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested. The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Fischer soon left the area.|$|E
5|$|The RSK's {{response}} to the agreement ended Fischer's efforts. Moreover, Fischer, Zabala and Platzer were criticised by the UN, citing their excessive assertiveness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Fischer left Croatia, and Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. The Zagreb–Belgrade motorway was reopened in December 1994 through an agreement between {{the governments of the}} RSK and Croatia. However, a series of armed incidents in late April 1995 led to a Croatian military intervention and the capture of the portion of Sector West previously controlled by the RSK in Operation Flash in early May.|$|E

A delay was also caused when Pryor {{suffered a heart attack}} in April 1991, and was replaced on the committee by Jeff Bingaman. Bingaman spent months learning the complex materials involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> only to resign in July due to a conflict of interest. Pryor was reassigned to the committee in August 1991, so as to not further delay its deliberations.|$|E

The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of the Brooks case as well.|$|E

Four tissue blocks were sampled from <b>the</b> entire white <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> a uniform random fashion. The length density of <b>the</b> myelinated fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> {{was obtained from the}} isotropic, uniform, random sections ensured by the isector. The volume density of <b>the</b> myelinated fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> was estimated by point counting. The total length and the total volume of <b>the</b> myelinated fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> were estimated by multiplying <b>the</b> white <b>matter</b> volume and <b>the</b> length density and the volume density of <b>the</b> myelinated fibers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white <b>matter,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> size of nerve fibers was derived by measuring the profile diameter perpendicular to its longest axis. The results were satisfactory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that the sampling variance introduced by the stereological estimation procedure was a minor fraction of the observed variance.
