In the first, it analyses the repercussion of the crisis on young people using information from certain social indicators (employment, mobility and education). It then outlines the subjective perception of the crisis, i. e., how they are experiencing it and what their hopes are regarding the economy and politics. The third part focuses on how young citizens have responded to the situation politically. The article finishes by considering what <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from that response in terms of citizenship education...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} social change is clearly central to discussions of oppressive systems and discourses which exist within current {{cultural}} contexts. Drawing on literature concerned with changing sexist and racist practices we reflect on the complexities of these debates. As feminist psychologists, we are {{particularly interested in the}} ways in which various strands of psychological theorising may come to embody, support and resist systems and practices of racialised and gendered oppression(s). In this paper, we discuss particular historical and contemporary efforts to subvert or deconstruct racist and sexist discourses within the context of particular theorisations of power to which specific calls for social change are aligned. Moreover, arguing from discursive and social constructionist standpoints, we consider how material and theoretical <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> out to encourage change in practice...|$|E
40|$|Gambling on poker {{has become}} a very popular {{activity}} among teenagers worldwide. However, to date, research exploring the consumer behavior of teenage poker players and contrasting poker players’ profile and personality with other gamblers is scarce. Our research addresses this gap and analyzes data from 2, 000 15 - 19 year-olds {{to better understand the}} demographic and psychological correlates of poker gambling. Our analysis suggests that poker players are more impulsive and sensation-seeking driven than other teenage gamblers, and they also possess more distorted gambling-related cognitions. There is a greater prevalence of problem gambling among poker players compared to those gamblers who do not bet on poker. There is evidence of comorbidity of teenage gambling with alcohol, but not with the use of tobacco and recreational drugs.

40|$|Intravenous digital {{subtraction}} angiography {{was used}} to determine prospectively the positional variations of the common carotid bifurcation in 100 consecutive patients with clinically suspected arteriosclerotic disease. The most common position (97 / 200, 48. 5 %) of the external carotid artery was anteromedial to the internal carotid artery. Position of the external carotid artery anterolateral to the internal carotid artery was noted in 26 / 200 (13 %) bifurcations, but this anatomical variant was more common on the right (21 / 100) than on the left (5 / 100) (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical {{validity of the}} tourism-led growth hypothesis in the top ten tourist destinations in the world (China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States) using the quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach and a new index of tourism activity that combines {{the most commonly used}} tourism indicators. This methodology, recently introduced by Sim and Zhou (2015), provides an ideal framework with which to capture the overall dependence structure between tourism development and economic growth. The empirical results primarily show a positive relation between tourism and economic growth for the ten countries considered with substantial variations across countries and across quantiles within each country. The weakest links are noted for China and Germany, possibly because of the limited importance of the tourism sector relative to other major economic activities in those countries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a small-scale exploratory investigation of code-switching (CS) between English and Farsi by 4 Iranian English foreign language (EFL) teachers in elementary level EFL classrooms in a language school in Isfahan, Iran. Specifically, the present study aimed at exploring the syntactical identification of switches and the functions that the switches served. The data consist of field notes and scripts of audio-recordings of the teachers’ talk collected during classroom observations. The findings suggest that CS is a frequently applied strategy and a valuable resource for bilingual teachers in foreign language classrooms, and its judicious and skillful use can boost the quality of teaching. Moreover, it was found that EFL teachers in this study tended to use the learners’ L 1 (i. e., Farsi) to serve a number of pedagogic and social functions, which contributed to better teacher-student classroom interaction. <b>Implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> for language teacher education programs and for further research on systematic investigation into actual classroom practices. </p...|$|E
40|$|Teacher {{attrition}} {{is costly}} for districts, both financially {{and in terms}} of student achievement. Districts often address teacher attrition by focusing on recruitment practices or by offering induction support for novice teachers. However, new teachers continue to leave the profession at alarming rates. This qualitative case study provides insight into how new teachers cope with the frustrations and challenges of entry-level teaching. The study examines the entry-level experiences of twelve novice teachers from urban secondary schools, including the perceptions of teaching they developed prior to entry, the aspects of teaching they found most frustrating, how they made sense of what was happening to them, and how they adapted their own behaviors in response to what they experienced. Viewed within a theoretical framework for examining the "newcomer experience" developed by Meryl Reis Louis in 1980, the data suggest that traditional group approaches to supporting novices fail to address the highly individual way in which newcomers "make sense" of teaching as they progress through a series of stages from anticipation through adaptation. From the data, <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in terms of "what matters" in the design of support systems for new teachers...|$|E

Second, the effort of Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) in managing the Ringgit in certain fluctuation bands has successfully maintained Malaysian’s macroeconomics equilibrium in the sample period of study. Third, economists who wish to extend the simple PPP exchange rate model into the more complicated monetary exchange models may do so comfortably, at least in the text of Malaysia. Nonetheless, such attempt should be tailored in a nonlinear way to suit the nonlinear characteristic of exchange rate behaviour.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} remittances and economic growth in Nigeria, using an error correction modeling approach for the period 1981 to 2011.

However, remittances show a signifi cant negative relationship with output in the short run. Also, while foreign aid as an external source of capital have both short and long term signifi cant infl uence on economic growth in Nigeria, its counterpart FDI can only exert positive impact on RGDP in the short run.

40|$|In {{response}} to contemporary concerns, and using neglected primary sources, {{this article explores}} the professionalisation of teachers of Religious Education (RI/RE) in non-denominational, state-maintained schools in England. It does so from the launch of Religion in Education (1934) and the Institute for Christian Education at Home and Abroad (1935) to {{the founding of the}} Religious Education Council of England and Wales (1973) and the British Journal of Religious Education (1978). Professionalisation is defined as a collective historical process in terms of three inter-related concepts: (1) professional self-organisation and professional politics, (2) professional knowledge, and (3) initial and continuing professional development. The article sketches the history of non-denominational religious education prior to the focus period, to contextualise the emergence of the professionalising processes under scrutiny. Professional self-organisation and professional politics are explored by reconstructing the origins and history of the Institute of Christian Education at Home and Abroad, which became the principal body offering professional development provision for RI/RE teachers for some fifty years. Professional knowledge is discussed in relation to the content of Religion in Education which was oriented around Christian Idealism and interdenominational networking. Changes in journal name in the 1960 s and 1970 s reflected uncertainties about the orientation of the subject and shifts in understanding over the nature and character of professional knowledge. The article also explores a particular case of resistance, in the late 1960 s, to the prevailing consensus surrounding the nature and purpose of RI/RE, and the representativeness and authority of the pre-eminent professional body of the time. In conclusion, the article examines some <b>implications</b> which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from this history for the prospects and problems of the professionalisation of RE today...|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity {{are high in}} Kuwait. Metabolic Syndrome is associated with both. It is expected to find the syndrome higher than in other countries. Objective: To assess the {{prevalence of}} MS using two different diagnostic criteria, the Interna tional Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program—Third Adult Treatment Panel Modified for age (NCEP-ATP III). Study design: A multi-stage random sample study. Methods: The analysis of {{data for this study}} was based on a sample of 303 male Kuwaiti adolescents, 10 - 19 years of age selected from intermediate and high schools. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests on blood samples were carried out. The IDF criterion requires waist circumference (WC) plus two of the following criteria: triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood sugar (FBS) and blood pressure (PB). The ATP III criterion requires three of the above parameters. The parameters mentioned must show increase in their values except for HDL which must show decrease in either criterion used. Results: Each of the two criterion revealed that the prevalence of MS was 14. 8 % and 19. 5 %, using the IDF and the ATP III criteria, respectively. HDL decreased in each of the two diagnostic criteria and the other four parameters increased, satisfying the diagnostic requirements of either criterion. Conclusions: Significant <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from these results, {{especially when it comes to}} being at risk of type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). </p...|$|E
40|$|Innate immune {{responses}} in general, and type I interferons (T 1 IFNs) in particular, {{play an important}} and often essential role during primary viral infections, by directly combatting the virus and by maximizing the primary adaptive immune response. Several {{studies have suggested that}} T 1 IFNs also contribute very substantially to the secondary (recall) response; they are thought (i) to be required to drive the early attrition of memory T cells, (ii) to support the subsequent expansion of surviving virus-specific memory cells, and (iii) to assist in the suppression and clearance of the infectious agent. However, many of these observations were predicated upon models in which T 1 IFN signaling was interrupted prior to a primary immune response, raising the possibility that the resulting memory cells might be intrinsically abnormal. We have directly addressed this by using an inducible-Cre model system in which the host remains genetically-intact during the primary response to infection, and in which T 1 IFN signaling can be effectively ablated prior to secondary viral challenge. We report that, in stark contrast to primary infection, T 1 IFN signaling is not required during the recall response. IFNαβR-deficient memory CD 8 + and CD 4 + memory T cells undergo attrition and expansion with kinetics that are indistinguishable from those of receptor-sufficient cells. Moreover, {{even in the absence of}} functional T 1 IFN signaling, the host's immune capacity to rapidly suppress, and then to eradicate, a secondary infection remains intact. Thus, this study shows that T 1 IFN signaling is dispensable during the recall response to a virus infection. Moreover, two broader <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn.</b> First, a T cell's requirement for a cytokine is highly dependent on the cell's maturation / differentiation status. Consequently, second, these data underscore the importance of evaluating a gene's impact by modulating its expression or function in a temporally-controllable manner...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the stage of}} {{planetary}} formation during which the particulate material is still dispersed as centimeter-to-meter sized primordial aggregates. During this stage, particles are able to settle toward the midplane into a layer of mass density comparable to or much {{greater than that of}} the gas. Nonlinear, coupled interactions between the particles and the nebula gas become significant and ultimately determine the vertical profiles of the particle density and the mean velocities of the particles and the nearby gas. This is the environment in which the earliest planetesimals probably form. Our numerical models rely on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations for the gas and particles and are fully viscous and turbulent (and, for the particles. compressible). Our turbulence modeling uses a Prandtl local shear parametrization, validated by laboratory experiments. We have developed a new model for particle diffusion involving the profile of the nebula gas turbulence and the particle Schmidt number, which is a function of particle size and density. We model a cool, quiescent nebula at 1 AU (280 K) and 10 AU (90 K) and a higher temperature stage (1000 K) at 1 AU. Our main results include: (a) rapid accretion of planetesimals by gravitationally unstable fragmentation on an orbital time scale (the 'Goldreich-Ward instability') is unlikely to occur until objects have already accreted by some other process to the mass of the largest known meteorite samples, if at all; (b) from 'seeds' as small as 10 m, growth of 10 - to 100 -km planetesimals can proceed rapidly by drift-augmented accretion in the particle-rich midplane with orbital decay of about 1 % for the growing planetesimals; (c) outward transport of vapor and small entrained chips can account for significant radial compositional and mineralogical mixing in primitive meteorite parent bodies.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis reports on a study into the decision-making that takes place within the six monthly statutory review of the cases {{of children in the}} care or {{under the supervision of the}} Local Authority. The research had four aims: 1. To develop a typology of review decisions whereby decisions taken in reviews could be classified according to their salient features. 2. To ascertain the level of the subsequent implementation of the decisions taken in reviews and to consider what factors contribute to or hinder their implementation. 3. To identify the functions of statutory reviews and the perceptions of the members of social work teams of the functions appropriate to reviews. 4. To consider the role and the importance of statutory reviews within the context of overall child care practice. The empirical research was undertaken in three social work area offices within one local authority. Information was gathered from almost three hundred reviews. The researcher, having first read the case record, attended two consecutive six-monthly reviews on the child. The social workers involved in these reviews were questioned on their opinions on reviews in general and on each review attended. Those 'researched' reviews gave rise to almost nine hundred review decisions, which were analysed according to the typology of decisions, and the level of their subsequent implementation was assessed. This study was designed as a policy-orientated study. Hence the research is presented first, within the broad context of developments in child care policy since the war, and second, in relation to the literature on statutory sreviews arising both from research studies and from policy documents. Furthermore, the concluding chapter points to the policy <b>implications</b> that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from the research findings, together with suggestions for policy changes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} some {{analytical}} questions {{that arise in}} the modern theory of con-sumption based on the intertemporal utility maximization model, {{also known as the}} Euler equation approach. It thus builds on the theoretical and empirical literature which has stemmed from the seminal contribution by Hall (1978), who extended the basic life cycle – permanent income model of consumption to the case of uncertainty. In reviewing this literature and the theoretical developments and extensions that the original model has undergone due to the need of accounting for the puzzling empirical evidence, the thesis aims at highlighting the crucial role that the preference parameters play in the specifica-tion of the theoretical content of the model and its predictions, and in the definition of the policy <b>implications</b> that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from it. Crucial as the role of preference parameters <b>may</b> <b>be</b> both in theory and practice, our analysis reveals, also by making use of some simulation exercises, the substantial inability of the Euler equation approach to give definite content to such parameters, due to the heavy dependence of the results of parameter estimation on the specification of the utility function. The first paper offers a survey of the literature which, following Hall (1978), has en-gaged in the task of testing the model against empirical evidence and proposing successive extensions and refinements of the original model ending up in the current enriched ver-sions of it. The paper draws on other surveys but focuses in particular on an overall as-sessment of the theoretical implications of the extensions which the literature has proposed. The second paper focuses on the literature directly aiming to estimate the pa-rameters characterizing preferences – offering in this respect a specific survey which seems to be lacking in the literature – and highlights the crucial role of the specification of the utility function in such estimates. Drawing on this result, the third paper proposes a number of original simulation exercises aimed at showing that the same time profile of consumption and saving may give rise to the estimation of rather different values of the crucial preference parameters depending on the particular utility function adopted...|$|R

Advisor: Dr. Judith Lambrecht. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 224 pages, appendices A-E. The {{purpose of the}} present study is to investigate the relative strength of parent involvement versus ethnicity and how they affect the academic achievement gap between racial backgrounds of Caucasian, African-American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American as measured by the reading portion of the State Site of Research Comprehensive Assessments-Series (SSRCA-II). The sample <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> from Connecting Parents to Educational Opportunities (CPEO) parents and their children who are in the district which was the site for this research. To be classified as a CPEO parent, he/she had to have completed a seven-week course at one of the research participant's Title I school sites since its 2008 inception year to present. The composition of student racial backgrounds in the present study was 53 % Caucasian and 25 % African-American students, which made up 78 % of the sample. Hispanic, Asian, and Native American students at percentages of 12 %, 7 %, and 3 %, respectively, represented the remaining 22 % of the sample. The inferential statistical results are based on the logistic regression analyses. Parenting and ethnicity variables, which were both independent variables, did not significantly improve any of the models' ability to predict students' reading proficiency. However, social economic status (SES), control variable, remained statistically significant through all of the analyses. Referring to the research question, the major finding from the research showed that SES was a significant predictor of student reading achievement. The findings were not expected but informative in terms of reshaping the discussion on academic achievement. The present study was not an experiment. Therefore, causal claims cannot be made, but <b>implications</b> for practice <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from the data analyses. Insights gained and ideas to ponder based on the data analyses are the (a) Cradle to Prison Pipeline, (b) equity of opportunities, and (c) business education. A pathway has been laid to answer the research question and provide new knowledge to school districts and the research community with a focus on equity, achievement and excellence for K- 12 students. The focus on parent involvement and ethnicity should be redirected to address the challenges of SES. Parent involvement and ethnicity are factors in the achievement gap issue. However, addressing SES primarily may bring greater reduction in the achievement gap and increased student achievement among public school students...|$|R

This study resulted from the researcher's interest in the processes of social change. In 1970 Salvador Allende, heading a leftist coalition, was elected president of Chile. In the following three years, multiple processes were implemented to bring about a new society in Chile. They varied in ideological consistency and effectiveness. Mass media have long been of interest to the researcher, who determined to follow the processes through which a traditional mass communication medium, the comic book, was brought towards consistency with leftist ideology. Many comic book readers in Chile were adults, and all changes had to allow for a pluralistic society. The problem {{of the study was to}} provide a qualitative description of the process and impact of underlying ideological elements in the shaping of informal educational interventions as evidenced by comic book production in Chile from 1970 to 1973, isolating critical factors affecting methodology, message content, implementation, and overall effectiveness of this medium as implemented within Chile's pluralistic society. The historical case study provided answers for the following research questions: (1) What specific cases of comic book usage could be considered as most representative of the differences in ideology, methodology, message content, dissemination, and perceived effectiveness? (2) Were practical compromises of ideological consistency made in order for social-change messages delivered by comic books to be considered more attractive or competitive within the pluralistic society of that time period?

The problem {{of this study was to}} determine how the needs of the changing family in a changing society could be better met within the elementary school curriculum. Several questions guided the development of an infusion model for the existing elementary school curriculum that would address the unmet needs: (1) What changes have occurred within the family and its societal relationships to necessitate possible changes within the elementary school? (2) What aspects of the curriculum require changes to meet the needs of the changing family? (3) How may the role of the teacher, other school personnel, and parents change to meet the needs of the changing family?In order to develop the infusion model, the design of this study consisted of a review of the literature about the changing family, future elementary school changes needed based on the needs of the changing family, and future role changes of the elementary school teacher, other school personnel, and parents to meet the needs of the changing family in a changing society. An evaluative checklist, based upon the ideas set forth in the model, was included. Several <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from this study. Many changes within the family structure and its relationship to society have occurred within a short period of time. Divorce runs rampant in every stratum of society. More women are employed because they seek the independence or are divorced and need the money. Fewer mothers at home have affected families. If the changing family is to be helped, then schools and society must work together. The school personnel, community people, business people, and lawmakers could take a more active role in helping families and with child care. Parents could help by letting their needs be known.

40|$|In a young proto{{planetary}} disk, planetary objects undergo orbital migration due to {{the gravitational}} torques exerted by their surrounding gas. It has been an outstanding issue that an earth-sized planet embedded in a gas-rich environment may rapidly migrate into its host star. In this dissertation, I study some of the processes that affect the orbital migration of planetary objects and their roles on planet formation scenarios. Sharp density features in protoplanetary disks, for instance {{at the edge of}} a magnetically dead zone, have recently been proposed as effective barriers to slow down or even stop the problematically fast migration of planetary cores into their central star. Density features on a radial scale approaching the disk vertical scale height might not exist, however, since they could be Rayleigh (or more generally Solberg-Høiland) unstable. Stability must be checked explicitly in one-dimensional viscous accretion disk models because these instabilities are artificially eliminated in the process of reducing the full set of axisymmetric equations. The disk thermodynamics, via the entropy stratification, and its vertical structure also influence stability when sharp density features are present. We propose the concept of Rayleigh adjustment for viscous disk models: any density feature that violates Rayleigh stability (or its generalization) should be diffused radially by hydrodynamical turbulence on a dynamical time-scale, approaching marginal stability in a quasi-continuous manner. Due to the gravitational influence of density fluctuations in the gas disk subject to magneto-rotational instability, planetesimals and protoplanets undergo diffusive radial migration as well as changes of other orbital properties. The magnitude of the effect on particle orbits has important consequences for planet formation scenarios. To accurately measure the gravitational influence of turbulent density fluctuations on particle orbits, numerical simulations capturing both large-scale and small-scale coherent structures are required. Using local shearing boxes with various resolutions up to 64 points per disk scale height and horizontal sizes up to 16 scale heights, we systematically study the corresponding density structure and particle orbit evolution. We consider ideal magnetized disks with isothermal equation of state, and compare disks with and without vertical stratification. We find that although the results converge with resolution for fixed box dimensions, the response of the particles to the gravity of the turbulent gas strongly depends on the horizontal box dimension. Our results indicate the dominance of large-scale density structures, which are closely related to recently discussed zonal flow models of protoplanetary disks. Based on heuristic arguments, some <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from the measurements of our local models. The radial diffusive migration of protoplanets induced by magneto-rotational turbulence may be unimportant compared to secular migration. Kilometer-sized planetesimals moving in magneto-rotational turbulence may not suffer from mutual collisional destruction, except for those in the inner region of a young protoplanetary disk.

40|$|The {{classification}} of the lexicon into categories (in {{the sense of}} ‘word classes’ or ‘parts of speech’) has been a fundamental matter of concern in linguistics since ancient times and the criteria for defining and delimiting the different categories have shifted according to the trends in linguistic theory (Hopper & Thompson 1984). Building on the Neogrammarians’ view (among others, Paul 1891), recent studies, such as Ramat (1999) and Bauer (2005), claim that lexical categories should {{not be seen as}} monolithic unities but as (structured) bundles of (formal, functional and semantic) features. The mainstream of current investigation in functional-cognitive linguistics follows this viewpoint and two major <b>implications</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from it. On the one hand, certain lexical items may combine more prototypical features of a particular lexical category than others. On the other hand, lexical items may combine properties of different categories. Diachronically speaking, the latter statement implies that shifts from one category to another may readily occur. Category change, broadly defined as the shift from one word class to another, is inherent to different processes of change, yet it is usually not given much consideration. Since the 1980 s, language change and innovation have essentially been accounted for by processes of grammaticalization and lexicalization (cf. Lehmann 1995 [1982], Brinton & Traugott 2005), with category change mostly seen as an accidental side-effect of these processes. However, in spite of their considerable merits, recent studies have pointed out major shortcomings of these approaches and have started to admit the relevance of constructions and context to language and language change. The fact that Construction Grammar, a linguistic framework that considers language as a complex network of ‘constructions’ (i. e. form-function pairings), has recently gained a lot of interest (cf. Goldberg 1995, Croft 2001, Hoffmann & Trousdale 2013) should be interpreted in this context. Against this background, I will revisit the definition of (lexical) category and category change. The focus will be on category change processes with a lexical item as output. I will set out different criteria that underlie the distinction between the main processes of category change (derivation, conversion, transposition and reanalysis). At the same time, the benefits of a Construction Grammar approach to category change will be demonstrated. More particularly, I adopt the view that a lexical category {{can be seen as a}} matrix of formal (morphosyntactic) and functional (semantic) features. As a consequence, lexical categories can be understood as abstract instances of ‘constructions’ and category change will be shown to be closely connected to the process of ‘constructionalization’, i. e. the creation of new form-meaning pairings (Traugott & Trousdale 2013). Since the shift to another category in general involves prominent changes at the formal level because the item has to conform to the morphological and syntactic properties (in the sense of complement types or inflectional properties, for instance) of the new word-class it belongs to, and this is logically reflected at the functional-semantic level too, it mostly results in the creation of a new construction. It will, however, also be shown that constructionalization is not involved in all types of recategorization. Furthermore, I will advance that the constructionist approach offers the advantage of accounting for the variety of input categories (ranging from morphemes to multi-word units) as well as for some problematic characteristics related to certain types of category change, such as context-sensitivity, counterdirectionality and defectiveness.
