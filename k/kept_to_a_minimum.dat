5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{designed}} by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the Regia Marina, based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main guns of a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire. In addition, the ship's superstructure and funnels were to be <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before clutch completion, {{which often}} leads {{to the death of}} the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} High Seas Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2006 {{following}} {{the completion of}} Jump Ultimate Stars as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> {{to focus attention on}} Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, Pandora's Tower went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, Pandora's Tower had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.|$|E

5|$|In late 1917, the High Seas Fleet {{began to}} conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December, German cruisers and destroyers intercepted and {{destroyed}} two British convoys to Norway. This prompted Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys in the North Sea. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet. At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> to prevent the British from learning of the operation. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters.|$|E
5|$|Over the Rainbow is {{the debut}} {{album of the}} child singer Connie Talbot, and was {{released}} 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. Talbot, who had entered the public eye after her appearance on the first series of Britain's Got Talent at age six, signed with Rainbow, an independent label, after briefly recording with Sony BMG. Over the Rainbow consists entirely of covers of pop and Christmas songs, and was recorded primarily in a spare {{room in the house}} of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt not to interrupt Talbot's childhood by disrupting her regular activities. Although public appearances were initially <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum,</b> Talbot did make appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
50|$|Administratively, Sundby {{belonged to}} the civil parish of Tårnby. In 1793, the northnmost part of the area, Amagerbro, was {{transferred}} to Copenhagen whose so-called Demarcation Line, which heavily restricted construction within a certain distance from the city walls, <b>kept</b> development <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b>|$|R

25|$|Keeping {{regulators}} {{warm and}} dry before diving, and limiting breathing from the regulator before immersion will {{reduce the risk of}} regulator freezing. Purging or any other cause of high flow rate markedly increases the probability of freezing and should be <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> absolute <b>minimum.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the history of}} clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered holes to be <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum,</b> restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good tone. In 1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder. It was airtight and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes. Müller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys. This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th-century makers made many enhancements to Müller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} E850 named Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded slowly, at Maunsell’s insistence, {{to ensure that}} the weight was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 gallon 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 gallon 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, Wyoming was to be demilitarized and {{converted}} into a training ship. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. Wyoming was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944; the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12-inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5-inch/38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed; these modifications allowed Wyoming to train anti-aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. Modifications to Arkansas during World War II were <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> In 1942, Arkansas received a new tripod foremast and bridgework, along with more anti-aircraft guns throughout the war. By 1945, she carried nine quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounts and twenty-eight 20 mm Oerlikons, and the number of 3-inch guns had been increased to ten.|$|E
50|$|Setup and {{configuration}} is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bare <b>minimum</b> {{because of}} the bottom-up approach utilized in the self-organizing network. There is no notion of a coordinator or network manager entity compared to technologies such as Zigbee or WirelessHART. This reduces the effort spent on setup and maintenance.|$|R
25|$|The Beatles {{sessions}} {{allowed the}} four members {{to work on}} separate projects {{at the same time}} and, as <b>a</b> result, <b>kept</b> tensions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> However, tempers flared during the recording session on 22 August 1968, and Ringo Starr walked out and announced that he had quit.|$|R
50|$|However, because {{errors in}} C code can easily lead to {{segmentation}} violations or to more subtle bugs, which crash the editor, and because writing C code that interacts correctly with the Emacs Lisp garbage collector is error-prone, {{the number of}} functions implemented as primitives is <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>minimum.</b>|$|R
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum.</b> For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present {{from the beginning of}} development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman {{who did not want to}} be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|Storage {{life for}} all teas can be {{extended}} by using desiccant or oxygen-absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in air-tight containers (except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is recommended and temperature variation <b>kept</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum).</b>|$|E
