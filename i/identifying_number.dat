5|$|With {{the other}} females not {{selected}} for immediate death, Frank {{was forced to}} strip naked to be disinfected, had her head shaved, and was tattooed with an <b>identifying</b> <b>number</b> on her arm. By day, the women were used as slave labour and Frank was forced to haul rocks and dig rolls of sod; by night, they were crammed into overcrowded barracks. Some witnesses later testified Frank became withdrawn and tearful when she saw children being led to the gas chambers; others reported that more often she displayed strength and courage. Her gregarious and confident nature allowed her to obtain extra bread rations for her mother, sister, and herself. Disease was rampant; before long, Frank's skin became badly infected by scabies. The Frank sisters were moved into an infirmary, which {{was in a state}} of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. Edith Frank stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for her daughters and passing her rations to them through a hole she made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.|$|E

5000|$|When given a Navon figure test, {{people with}} {{dyslexia}} have difficulty automatically identifying graphemes with phonemes, {{but not with}} <b>identifying</b> <b>numbers</b> with magnitudes. [...] On the other hand, people with dyscalculia have difficulty automatically <b>identifying</b> <b>numbers</b> with magnitudes, but not letters and with phonemes. This suggests a dissociation between subjects with dyslexia and dyscalculia. These developmental learning disabilities do not cause general problems with identifying symbols to their mental representations, but rather create specific challenges.|$|R

They do not coincide with any other <b>identifying</b> <b>number</b> such as the car's VIN code, dealer or zone order, production sequence, nor build date. For example, the numbers on the 1970 models ranged from 014469 to 18584.|$|E
25|$|However, {{usually the}} {{syndicate}} re-formed {{for the next}} calendar year with {{more or less the}} same membership and the same <b>identifying</b> <b>number.</b> In this way, a syndicate could have a continuous existence going back (in some cases) 50 years or more, but each year was accounted for separately. There would have been 50 separate incarnations of this example syndicate, each one a separate trading entity that underwrote insurance for one calendar year only.|$|E

In cases where the transcription of the sign remains in doubt, Bennett's number serves to identify the sign. The signs on the tablets and sealings often show considerable variation from each other and from the representations below. Discovery {{of the reasons for the}} variation and possible semantic differences is a topic of ongoing debate in Mycenaean studies.|$|E

500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the nape of her neck, with her <b>identifying</b> <b>number</b> sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be [...] "the perfect soldier," [...] Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold her breath underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name [...] "Guevara" [...] for herself.|$|E
500|$|At least 700 {{grizzly bears}} are {{believed}} {{to exist in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes Shoshone National Forest, with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest. The grizzly is listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the forest is one of their last strongholds. For what are considered to be [...] "nuisance bears", non-lethal traps are set to capture them {{so that they can be}} relocated to remote areas, away from civilization. In the case of the grizzly, each captured bear is tranquilized and then ear tagged with an <b>identifying</b> <b>number.</b> Each number is registered, and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety, they are exterminated. The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities. This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive black bear. An active management program, in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears. Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds, and bear-proof trash receptacles are located in the front-country zones throughout the forest. In the backcountry, food must be stored some distance from campsites, and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters.|$|E

This study concludes that such variations are minor and that the pathway that children follow when learning to <b>identify</b> <b>numbers</b> follows the same pattern across different groups. This finding is significant in furthering our knowledge of children’s early mathematics development; it suggests that there is a universal developmental scale from which the diverse aspects of mathematical development can be viewed. This lays the foundation for international comparisons of the mathematical development of young children...|$|R

2500|$|Two key {{classes of}} {{regulatory}} molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's {{progress through the}} cell cycle. Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules. Many of the genes encoding cyclins and CDKs are conserved among all eukaryotes, but in general more complex organisms have more elaborate cell cycle control systems that incorporate more individual components. Many of the relevant genes were first identified by studying yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae; genetic nomenclature in yeast dubs many of these genes cdc (for [...] "cell division cycle") followed by an <b>identifying</b> <b>number,</b> e.g. cdc25 or cdc20.|$|E
