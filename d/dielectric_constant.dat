The static dielectric measurements {{have been achieved}} by using the new set up presented in the previous work based on a low-pass filter. From the experimental data, excess <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants,</b> ɛE have been calculated and reported. An empirical polynomial equation was used for correlating the data of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants</b> for the aqueous solutions. In addition, the measured static <b>dielectric</b> <b>constants</b> data have been calculated {{on the basis of}} the empirical modification of the Kirkwood theory for multicomponent systems.

5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of the material.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Several {{condensed}} matter experiments involve {{scattering of}} an experimental probe, such as X-ray, optical photons, neutrons, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe {{depends on the}} observation energy scale of interest. Visible light has energy {{on the scale of}} 1 electron volt (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> and refractive index. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 keV and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (<b>dielectric</b> <b>constant)</b> of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E

5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant.</b> Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated. These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E
25|$|Solvents can be broadly {{classified}} into two categories: polar and non-polar. A special case is mercury, whose solutions {{are known as}} amalgams; also, other metal solutions exist which are liquid at room temperature. Generally, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of the solvent provides a rough measure of a solvent's polarity. The strong polarity of water is indicated by its high <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of 88 (at 0°C). Solvents with a <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of less than 15 are {{generally considered to be}} nonpolar. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> measures the solvent's tendency to partly cancel the field strength of the electric field of a charged particle immersed in it. This reduction is then compared to the field strength of the charged particle in a vacuum. Heuristically, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of a solvent {{can be thought of as}} its ability to reduce the solute's effective internal charge. Generally, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>constant</b> of a solvent is an acceptable predictor of the solvent's ability to dissolve common ionic compounds, such as salts.|$|E
