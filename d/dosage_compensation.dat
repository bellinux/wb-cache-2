25|$|While the {{epigenetic}} mechanisms behind <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> {{in birds}} are poorly understood, especially {{in comparison to}} the well-studied mechanisms of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in humans and Drosophila, several recent studies have revealed promising sequences. One example is MHM (male hypermethylated) RNA, an Xist-like long noncoding RNA that is expressed only in female chickens (ZW). It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome. This MHM locus is heavily studied as a site of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> because male Z chromosomes are hypermethylated and thus underexpress genes in this area in comparison to female Z chromosomes which are hyperacetylated and overexpress these genes. There has been debate on whether the MHM locus constitutes <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> however, since scientists claim that even if the MHM locus has been found to have significantly greater expression in females than in males, it could not even be considered to be a <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> mechanism since it does not balance gene dose between the Z chromosome and autosomes in the heterogametic sex.|$|E
25|$|Though all of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b> This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target. However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an additive effect on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> mechanics. This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> fate. Thus, in this model organism, the achieved level of X-chromosome expression is directly correlated to the activation of multiple XSEs that ultimately function to repress xol-1 expression in a developing worm embryo. A summary of this C. elegans mechanism of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> is illustrated below.|$|E
25|$|The sex {{chromosomes}} {{of birds}} evolved separately {{from those of}} mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two male X chromosomes of Drosophila. However, bird mechanisms of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as “less effective” at <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> than mammals. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may {{play an important role in}} recruiting <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans. Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main {{mechanisms}} of achieving <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> which are widely {{documented in the}} literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in Mus musculus), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in Drosophila melanogaster), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in Caenorhabditis elegans). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory research setting. A summary of these forms of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and monotreme species).|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} DCC in {{this form}} of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> was {{postulated}} by Barbara J. Meyer in the 1980s, and its individual components and their cooperative function were later parsed out by her lab. Notably, in 1999, data from Meyer’s lab showed that SDC-2 is a particularly important transcriptional factor for targeting the DCC to the X chromosome and for assembling DCC components onto the X chromosomes in XX embryos. More recently, Meyer’s lab has shown that proteins known as X-linked signal elements (XSEs) operate in concert with SDC-2 to differentially repress and activate other genes in the <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> pathway. By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in worms, Meyer’s group demonstrated which XSEs specifically {{play a role in}} determining normal <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b> They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes—including sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39—act in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites. Xol-1 expression is tightly regulated during early development, and is considered the most upstream gene in sex determination of C. elegans. In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.|$|E
25|$|In this XX/XO sex {{determination}} system, gene expression on the X chromosome is equalized by downregulating expression of genes on both X chromosomes of hermaphroditic XX organisms by half. In these XX organisms, the <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> complex (DCC) is assembled on both X chromosomes {{to allow for}} this tightly regulated change in transcription levels. The DCC is often compared to the condensin complex, which is conserved across the mitotic and meiotic processes of many species. This complex {{is crucial to the}} condensation and segregation of chromosomes during both meiosis and mitosis. Because data substantiates the theory that <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in other species is caused by chromatin-wide modifications, many theorize that the DCC in particular functions similar to the condensin complex in its ability to condense or remodel the chromatin of the X chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|Platypuses are a monotreme species whose {{mechanism}} of sex determination {{has been extensively}} studied. There is some contention in academia about the evolutionary origin and the proper taxonomy of platypuses. A recent study revealed that four platypus X chromosomes, {{as well as a}} Y chromosome, are homologous to some regions on the avian Z chromosome. Specifically, platypus X1 shares homology with the chicken Z chromosome, and both share homology with the human chromosome 9. This homology is important when considering the {{mechanism of}} <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in monotremes. In 50% of female platypus cells, only one of the alleles on these X chromosomes is expressed while in the remaining 50% multiple alleles are expressed. This, combined with the portions that are homologous to chicken Z and human 9 chromosomes imply that this level of incomplete silencing may be the ancestral form of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{pattern of}} <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> caused by random X-inactivation, is {{regulated}} across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, {{at the beginning}} of most female mammal development, both X chromosomes are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X. In germ cells, inactivated X chromosomes are then once again activated to ensure their expression in gametes produced by female mammals.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for this mechanism of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> was discovered prior to scientists’ understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, Murray Barr and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of “nucleolar satellites, which they observed {{were present in the}} mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed heterochromatin, but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.|$|E
25|$|X-{{inactivation}}. The inactivation of one X chromosome {{takes place}} during the early development of mammals (see Barr body and <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation).</b> In placental mammals, the inactivation is random as between the two Xs; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her X chromosomes. In marsupials it is always the paternal X which is inactivated. In human females some 15% of somatic cells escape inactivation, {{and the number of}} genes affected on the inactivated X chromosome varies between cells: in fibroblast cells up about 25% of genes on the Barr body escape inactivation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{species that}} do not follow the {{previously}} discussed conventions of XX females and XY males must find alternative ways to equalize X-linked gene expression among differing sexes. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans (or C. elegans), sex {{is determined by the}} ratio of X chromosomes relative to autosomes; worms with two X chromosomes (XX worms) develop as hermaphrodites, whereas those with only one X chromosome (XO worms) develop as males. This system of sex determination is unique, because there is no male specific chromosome, {{as is the case in}} XX/XY sex determination systems. However, as is the case with the previously discussed mechanisms of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> failure to express X-linked genes appropriately can still be lethal.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> {{actually}} originated from {{an understanding of}} organisms in which males upregulated X-linked genes two-fold, and was much later extended {{to account for the}} observation of the once mysterious Barr bodies. As early as 1932, H.J. Muller carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an X-linked gene. Muller introduced a mutant gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase “dosage compensation” to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization.|$|E
25|$|Despite these advances, it was {{not until}} Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann {{performed}} more advanced autoradiography experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes. Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes. Their studies showed equal levels of uridine incorporation in the single male X chromosome and the two female X chromosomes. Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of RNA synthesis in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller’s hypothesized <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the genes}} which escape {{inactivation}} are present along regions of the X chromosome which, unlike {{the majority of the}} X chromosome, contain genes also present on the Y chromosome. These regions are termed pseudoautosomal regions, as individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in these regions (like an autosome), unlike the majority of genes along the sex chromosomes. Since individuals of either sex will receive two copies of every gene in a pseudoautosomal region, no <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> is needed for females, so it is postulated that these regions of DNA have evolved mechanisms to escape X-inactivation. The genes of pseudoautosomal regions of the Xi do not have the typical modifications of the Xi and have little Xist RNA bound.|$|E
25|$|In {{organisms that}} use {{this method of}} <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> the {{presence}} {{of one or more}} X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread {{along the length of the}} chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. The implications of this spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> is {{the process}} by which organisms {{equalize}} the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes. In order to account for varying numbers of sex chromosomes, different organisms have acquired unique methods to equalize gene expression amongst the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes, different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual gene is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene. For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{two-fold}} increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome. It is common in such organisms for the Y chromosome to be necessary for male fertility, but not for it to play an explicit role in sex determination. In Drosophila, for example, the sex lethal (SXL) gene acts as a key regulator of sexual differentiation and maturation in somatic tissue; in XX animals, SXL is activated to repress increased transcription, while in XY animals SXL is inactive and allows male development to proceed via increased transcription of the single X. Several binding sites exist on the Drosophila X chromosome for the <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> complex (DCC), a ribonucleoprotein complex; these binding sites have varying levels of affinity, presumably for varying expression of specific genes. The Male Specific Lethal complex, composed of protein and RNA binds and selectively modifies hundreds of X-linked genes, increasing their transcription to levels comparable to female D. melanogaster.|$|E
25|$|MOZ (Monocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein), Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and Tip60 (Tat Interacting Protein) {{all make}} up MYST, another well known family that {{exhibits}} acetylating capabilities. This family includes Sas3, essential SAS-related acetyltransferase (Esa1), Sas2, Tip60, MOF, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1. The {{members of this}} family have multiple functions, not only with activating and silencing genes, but also affect development and have implications in human diseases. Sas2 and Sas3 are involved in transcription silencing, MOZ and TIF2 are involved {{with the formation of}} leukemic transclocation products while MOF is involved in <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in Drosophila. HAT domains for this family are approximately 250 residues which include cysteine-rich, zinc binding domains as well as N-terminal chromodomains. The MYST proteins Esa1, Sas2 and Sas3 are found in yeast, MOF is found in Drosophila while Tip60, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1 are found in humans. Tip60 has roles in the regulation of gene transcription, HBO has been found to impact the DNA replication process, MORF is able to acetylate free histones (especially H3 and H4) as well as nucleosomal histones.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to humans and flies, some plants also {{make use of}} the XX/XY <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> systems. Silene latifolia plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies [...] have shown male S. latifolia expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the S. latifolia did not practice <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, {{it has been suggested that}} S. latiforia and its <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either aneuploidy or polyploidy. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> in mammals {{is largely}} {{achieved}} through the silencing {{of one of}} two female X chromosomes via X-inactivation. This process involves histone tail modifications, DNA methylation patterns, and reorganization of large-scale chromatin structure encoded by the X-ist gene. In spite of these extensive modifications, not all genes along the X chromosome are subject to X-inactivation; active expression at some loci is required for homologous recombination with the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of the Y chromosome during meiosis. Additionally, 10-25% of human X chromosome genes, and 3-7% of mouse X chromosome genes [...] outside of the PARs show weak expression from the inactive X chromosome.|$|E
2500|$|X-inactivation (also called lyonization) is {{a process}} by {{which one of the}} copies of the X {{chromosome}} present in female mammals is inactivated. The inactive X chromosome is silenced by its being packaged {{in such a way that}} it has a transcriptionally inactive structure called heterochromatin. As nearly all female mammals have two X chromosomes, X-inactivation prevents them from having twice as many X chromosome gene products as males, who only possess a single copy of the X chromosome (see <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation).</b> The choice of which X chromosome will be inactivated is random in placental mammals such as [...] humans, but once an X chromosome is inactivated it will remain inactive throughout the lifetime of the cell and its descendants in the organism. Unlike the random X-inactivation in placental mammals, inactivation in marsupials applies exclusively to the paternally derived X chromosome.|$|E
50|$|While {{there has}} not been {{extensive}} research on other organisms with the ZW sex-determination system, in 2007, researchers announced that chickens' and zebra finches' sex chromosomes do not exhibit any type of chromosome-wide <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> and instead seem to dosage compensate on a gene-by-gene basis. Specific locations on the chicken Z chromosome, such as the MHM region, are thought to exhibit regional <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation,</b> though researchers have argued that this region does not actually constitute local <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b> Further research expanded the list of birds that do not exhibit any type of chromosome-wide <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> to crows and ratites, thus implying that all avian chromosomes lack chromosome-wide <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation.</b> Both transcriptional and translational gene-specific <b>dosage</b> <b>compensation</b> have been observed in avian sex chromosomes.|$|E
