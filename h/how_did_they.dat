5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, {{but was it}} an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or {{a man in a}} crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
