40|$|HIGH-POWERED MONEY {{as defined}} here—bank {{reserves}} and currency {{held by the}} public—is ultimately {{under the control of}} governments, which have authority to alter the conditions of issue and to change the quantity outstanding. Statutory regulations concerning money therefore {{play an important role in}} the monetary histories of most countries and in particular of the United States. This country had an inconvertible paper standard from the Civil War until 1879. It was on the gold standard from then until 1933, except for an <b>embargo</b> <b>on</b> <b>gold</b> exports during World War I. Since 1934 it has had the so-called gold bullion standard, which—because of the huge gold stock ac-cumulated in excess of statutory requirements during the 1920 's and 1930 's—until the late l 950 's allowed the government much of the freedom of an inconvertible standard. Those regulations account for much of the behavior of high-powered money in this country, though they do not alone explain the timing and amplitude of many variation...|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{gold standard}} {{was established in}} 1821 by the United Kingdom as the Bank of England enabled redemption of its banknotes for gold bullion. France, Germany, the United States, Russia, and Japan each embraced the standard one by one from 1878 to 1897, marking its international acceptance. The first departure from the standard occurred in August 1914 when these nations erected trade <b>embargoes</b> <b>on</b> <b>gold</b> exports and suspended redemption of gold for banknotes. Following the end of World War I on November 11, 1918, Austria, Hungary, Germany, Russia, and Poland began experiencing hyperinflation. Having informally departed from the standard, most currencies were freed from exchange rate fixing and allowed to float. Most countries throughout this period sought to gain national advantages and bolster exports by depreciating their currency values to predatory levels. A number of countries, including the United States, made unenthusiastic and uncoordinated attempts to restore the former gold standard. The {{early years of the}} Great Depression brought about bank runs in the United States, Austria, and Germany, which placed pressures <b>on</b> <b>gold</b> reserves in the United Kingdom {{to such a degree that}} the gold standard became unsustainable. Germany became the first nation to formally abandon the post-World War I gold standard when the Dresdner Bank implemented foreign exchange controls and announced bankruptcy on July 15, 1931. In September 1931, the United Kingdom allowed the pound sterling to float freely. By the end of 1931, a host of countries including Austria, Canada, Japan, and Sweden abandoned gold. Following widespread bank failures and a hemorrhaging of gold reserves, the United States broke free of the gold standard in April 1933. France would not follow suit until 1936 as investors fled from the franc due to political concerns over Prime Minister Léon Blum's government.|$|R
