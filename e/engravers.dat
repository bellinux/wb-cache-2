5|$|Notable {{painters}} and <b>engravers</b> Władysław supported and who attended his royal court included Peter Paul Rubens, Tommaso Dolabella Peter Danckerts de Rij, Wilhelm Hondius, Bartłomiej Strobel, and Christian Melich. His royal orchestra was headed by kapellmeister Marco Scacchi, seconded by Bartłomiej Pękiel.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's <b>engravers</b> fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, {{at a lower price}} to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and <b>engravers</b> led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E
5|$|Bewick had {{at least}} 30 pupils who worked for him and Beilby as apprentices, {{the first of which}} was his younger brother John. Several gained {{distinction}} as <b>engravers,</b> including John Anderson, Luke Clennell, Charlton Nesbit, William Harvey, Robert Johnson, and his son and later partner Robert Elliot Bewick.|$|E

5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving. This is due both to his skill and to the method, which unlike the wood cut technique of his predecessors, carves against the grain, in hard box wood, using fine tools normally favoured by metal <b>engravers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boydell {{sought out}} the most eminent {{painters}} and <b>engravers</b> {{of the day to}} contribute paintings for the gallery, engravings for the folio, and illustrations for the edition. Artists included Richard Westall, Thomas Stothard, George Romney, Henry Fuseli, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Smirke, James Durno, John Opie, Francesco Bartolozzi, Thomas Kirk, Henry Thomson, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, Josiah Boydell.|$|E
5|$|His {{career began}} when he was apprenticed to {{engraver}} Ralph Beilby in Newcastle upon Tyne. He became {{a partner in the}} business and eventually took it over.

60|$|It may be here objected that I {{ought not}} to have felt so sure as I did of the woman's guilt, until I had got more {{evidence}} against her. The knife might have been stolen from her, supposing she was {{the person who had}} snatched it out of the <b>engraver's</b> hands, and might have been afterward used by the thief to commit the murder. All very true. But I never had a moment's doubt in my own mind, from the time when I read the damnable line in the <b>engraver's</b> book.|$|R
5|$|A {{commemorative}} {{was wanted}} by the State of Illinois {{to mark the}} centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. It met no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process. After it passed, the two <b>engravers</b> produced designs, but Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo required changes, not {{all of which were}} made.|$|E
5|$|Of John and Susannah Sartain's children, Samuel (1830–1906), Henry (1833–1895), William Sartain (1843–1925) and Emily were {{painters}} and <b>engravers,</b> beginning {{a legacy of}} Sartain family artists and printmakers. Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support and connections. She carried on the mezzatint engraving technique that he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the <b>engravers</b> Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to paint the ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E

50|$|Baratti {{studied and}} worked for a time at an <b>engraver's</b> {{workshop}} in Bassano del Grappa. He primarily engraved portraits and religious themed works, many of which appeared in publications at the time. Baratti died in 1787.|$|R
50|$|The one leu coin design {{changed in}} 1910. On the obverse, {{the title was}} split either side of Carol I with the <b>engraver's</b> name, TASSET underneath. On the obverse was a woman walking, with the country name in the top left corner, the {{denomination}} in the top right, {{the year in the}} bottom right and the <b>engraver's</b> name (Costache) BASSARAB in the bottom left. The reverse design was {{similar to that of the}} French one franc coin, as both countries were in the Latin Monetary Union. The coins were minted in Brussels and Hamburg, with the Brussels coins having 106 reeds on the edge compared to 102 from Hamburg. Mintage continued up to 1914 with none minted for 1913.|$|R
5|$|The {{works of}} William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed {{popularity}} in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions {{of his works}} were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and <b>engravers.</b> He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor George Steevens to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.|$|E
5|$|Charles E. Barber {{was born}} in London in 1840. His grandfather, John Barber, led the family to America in the early 1850s. Both John and his son William were <b>engravers</b> and Charles {{followed}} in their footsteps. The Barber family initially lived in Boston upon their arrival to the United States, though they later moved to Providence to allow William {{to work for the}} Gorham Manufacturing Company. William Barber's skills {{came to the attention of}} Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, who hired him as an assistant engraver in 1865; when Longacre died in 1869, William Barber became chief engraver and Charles was hired as an assistant engraver.|$|E
5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple <b>engravers.</b> The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E
50|$|Friedrich Wilhelm Heine {{spent the}} first forty {{years of his life}} in Germany. At the age of {{fourteen}} he was a copper and steel <b>engraver's</b> apprentice and later attended the Leipzig and Weimar Academies in Germany, working as a book illustrator and designer from 1861 to 1866.|$|R
50|$|Flipart {{was born}} in Paris. His father was the {{engraver}} Jean Charles Flipart, under whom he received his initial training in the <b>engraver's</b> art. His brother Charles Joseph Flipart, who was later noted both for his engraving and painting oeuvre, also received his initial training under the father's hand.|$|R
50|$|The Children's Literature Research Collection at the Free Library of Philadelphia houses typescripts, galley proofs, and <b>engraver's</b> proofs {{for several}} of Honness' books, which she {{published}} between 1957 and 1966. The library staff extemporaneously interviewed her and fellow authors Carolyn Haywood and Donald Cooke in 1953 and 1958.|$|R
5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare new designs. He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's <b>engravers</b> and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} plays. It was also reused in later folios, although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later <b>engravers</b> copying the original printed image.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{moves into}} {{crystallography}} and mineralogy, describing the octahedral {{shape of the}} diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem <b>engravers</b> to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
50|$|Clearing {{the site}} began in 1864, and {{required}} {{the demolition of}} over 100 buildings, including the <b>Engraver's</b> Arms pub, a coffee roasting works, a smithy, a coal yard and various warehouses. The project was encouraged by the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to open the Albert Monument in 1869.|$|R
