40|$|A Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law {{exists in}} Japan. This law was {{effective}} since 1949 and minor revision {{has been made}} a number of time. However, a major revision of this law was made in 1988 and was effective for school year 1990. The purposes of this study are following: 1) To clarify the status of curricula for the pre-service training of lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education before and after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law; 2) To Compere and to clarify the differences of new curricula from old ones; and 3) To find out the trends and probrems of curricula for the pre-service training of science teachers. The main results were as follows; 1) There is a variety of professional education curricula for lower secondary science teachers in national colleges of education. 2) In 1990, the average number of credits for Science Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoka-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) was not different as compared with the case of 1988. However, the legal number of credits for Laboratories as a part of Science Subjects was changed from 4 to 8 after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. And actual number of credits for these subjects increased according to the law. The doubling of the number of credits for Laboratories meets with the approval of over 600 f the institutions. However, there is no backing of collateral increase of faculty members and budget, therefore a heavy burden must necessarily be imposed on science faculty members. 3) The number of credits for Professional Teaching Subjects (2 ̆ 7 Kyoshoku-senmon-kamoku 2 ̆ 7) increased after revision of the Teacher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Certificate</b> Law. However, the number of credits for Methodology of Science Teaching (2 ̆ 7 Rika-Kyoikuho 2 ̆ 7), which is an integrative subject in pre-service training courses for science teachers, decreased. Though other science education subjects are offered in most of the institutions, yet students will have no time to study these subjects, because of Laboratories and Professional Teaching Subjects with the exception of Methodology of Science Teaching. ...|$|R

40|$|The E-book "Nucleation and Crystallization of Glasses and Glass-Ceramics" {{highlights}} historic {{perspectives and}} current {{research in the}} field of glass-ceramic technology. Glass-ceramic technology is promising to provide us with materials of high strength, high toughness, unique electrical/electronic or magnetic properties, exceptional optical or unusual thermal or chemical properties. The greater diversity of microstructure-property arrangements and processing routes over glasses and ceramics are responsible that glass-ceramics are the preferred choice of materials in many technical, consumer, optical, medical/dental, electrical/electronic, and architectural fields. This includes increasing uses of glass-ceramic materials for environment and energy applications in the last decades. The positive development of glass-ceramic technology has become true in particular due to the pioneering spirit, resourcefulness, and courage of researchers of the first generation. Extraordinary and, therefore, to be distinguished is the work of the glass-ceramic <b>inventor</b> <b>S.</b> Donald Stookey to whom this Research Topic is dedicated.

In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore studying Physical Chemistry at Tsinghua University in Beijing. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain and extensive hair loss. Ultimately she was diagnosed on Usenet with poisoning by thallium. To this day, there is still speculation as to the poisoner's identity among Chinese expatriates overseas. The primary (and only) suspect of the police investigation, Sun Wei, is a member of a family with high-level political connections, which may have been used to halt and suppress the results of the investigation. Sun Wei was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said she was the only student who had access to thallium compound at the school. The investigation's results have never been released to Zhu Ling's parents or the general public.
