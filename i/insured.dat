Also the expected insurance efficiency is analyzed in a type of a nonlinear function that may get different values according to its variable (refuse of <b>insuring,</b> full asset insurance, and partial asset loose). It is shown that when <b>insuring</b> the full asset insurance efficiency with deductible differs from expected efficiency without deductible. The conditions when it is advantageous to <b>insure</b> the asset without deductibles are determined.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the <b>insured</b> and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured.

The mandate increased the size and diversity of the <b>insured</b> population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs.

Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000houses and damaged 13,000homes and businesses, leaving 25,000people homeless. About 150businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. <b>Insured</b> damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩650billion (KRW, $565million), mostly property damage.

By comparison, this total was ₩2.52trillion (KRW, $1.9billion USD) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between the <b>insured</b> and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interactions}} between the risk of food insecurity and the decision to health <b>insure</b> in the Palestinian Territories. The risk of adverse health conditions is insurable; the risk of food insecurity is a background risk and no market insurance exists. The vulnerability to food insecurity influences the individual utility from health <b>insuring.</b> We present a competing risk model to reveal this interdependence. We specify the empirical model as a bivariate probit model and evaluate the impact of food insecurity on the household decision to health <b>insure.</b> We find evidence of significant complementarity between the risk of food insecurity and the propensity to health <b>insure.</b> The predicted conditional probabilities reveal that the propensity to health <b>insure</b> is higher in presence of food insecurity among Palestinian households. This study shows that, in presence of a background risk, there are complementarities among risks that policy should be mindful of. ...|$|R
