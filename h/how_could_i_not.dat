25|$|Suddenly I’m here at {{the post}} office. The mail is going out today and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> write to my Sarenka? Just now, my husband, little Bernhard was here. He looks good and feels well. I’m curious about how you are, how your health is. We are well and plan {{to go to the}} camp. Today is a {{gorgeous}} day, we are in the best of spirits and have great hopes for the future…Don’t worry, girl, it’ll be fine. Be brave, stay well. Warm regards from my entire family and our Bernhard.|$|E
500|$|American {{rock band}} The Flaming Lips {{recorded}} [...] "SpongeBob & Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy". They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in [...] Tweedy said, [...] "I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness {{at the bottom of the}} sea as 'advanced darkness' <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block." [...] Avril Lavigne recorded the series' theme for the soundtrack. Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead, singing [...] "You Better Swim" [...] (a derivative of their 1992 song [...] "You'd Better Run"); Prince Paul ("Prince Paul's Bubble Party"); Ween ("Ocean Man"), and the Shins ("They'll Soon Discover", partially written in 2001).|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} nothing better,' cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, {{as they always}} {{did when he was}} pleased. 'But <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> get there? <b>Not</b> by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!' ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he swore}} so fervently by his Christ that I {{was sure he}} would never break the oath. After he had sworn I told him <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rest because of the strange fears which oppressed me.|$|R
500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and {{the best we can do}} for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E
2500|$|A Democratic Progressive Party {{legislator}} in Taiwan, Yu Tien made offensive comments regarding Muslims, {{claiming they}} were a [...] "light hearted joke", linking terrorism to Muslims while campaigning. His wife had {{said she was a}} “Muslim terrorist early on … like Osama bin Laden.” Yu replied: “People have been saying that I am afraid of my wife. Faced with such a Muslim militant, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be afraid?” He then apologized after the incident, saying he was [...] "Deeply apologetic", and [...] "We weren’t trying to connect Muslims with terrorists and we hope the public doesn’t misunderstand us. We respect every religion.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reintroduction}} of Vicki {{was part}} of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's [...] "iconic" [...] father Den, Johnson said, [...] "I was 2 when he left EastEnders [...] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [...] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and no one does edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. EastEnders is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They were {{a strong}} body, but <b>how</b> strong <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell. A hundred Prussians marching will {{make as much}} noise as five hundred Frenchmen, but even {{allowing}} for that I should {{think there will be}} at least one strong battalion, perhaps more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Run away? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> {{even know}} which way the river lay; and was it {{possible}} for me to cross the desert on foot, or find the chance of a camel? The Senoosis would have killed me. Even with you to help me, see what dangers surround me; alone, I should have perished, like Hagar in the wilderness, with no angel to save me.' ...|$|R
60|$|But at {{last the}} allotted moment arrived--the moment for which I {{had been trying to}} prepare myself, for <b>how</b> long <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> even guess. A great Sagoth came and spoke some words of command to those who watched over me. I was jerked roughly to my feet and with little {{consideration}} hustled upward toward the higher levels.|$|R
6000|$|As all {{was thus}} {{suddenly}} revealed to me I laughed unpleasantly at myself, for, on my soul, I {{had been thinking}} well of Mary of late. Always foolishly inflated about David, she had been grudging him even to me during these last weeks, and I had forgiven her, putting {{it down to a}} mother's love. I knew from the poor boy of unwonted treats she had been giving him; I had seen her embrace him furtively in a public place, her every act, in so far as they were known to me, had been a challenge to whoever dare assert that she wanted anyone but David. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> being a woman, have guessed that she was really saying good-bye to him? ...|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} that second blissful revelation which came to me from my mother. Happy as it made {{me to know that}} death would not put an end to my existence, my state after the first joyful relief was not one of perfect happiness. All she said to comfort and make me brave had {{produced}} its effect--I knew now that death was but a change to an even greater bliss than I could have in this life. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> yet six, think otherwise than as she had told me to think, or have a doubt? A mother is more to her child than any other being, human or divine, can ever be to him in his subsequent life. He is as dependent on her as any fledgling in the nest on its parent--even more, since she warms his callow mind or soul as well as body.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} whether Lady Diana viewed them as bad {{companion}}s for her son, or her son as a bad companion for them; but she was very severe about it, and when I thought of the hunt dinner at Foling, my heart sank, even while I was indignant at any notion of distrusting Harold; and it did indeed seem to me that he had learnt where to look for strength and self-command, and that he had a real hatred and contempt of evil. Yet I should have been more entirely happy about him if he had not still held aloof from all those innermost ordinances, of which he somehow did not feel the need, or understand the full drift. Nor would he bow himself to give to any man the confidence or the influence over him he had given to an incapable girl like me. And if I should have feared for the best brought up, most religious of young men, in such scenes as I was told were apt to take place at Killy Marey, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be anxious for my nephews? But nothing ever turns out as one expects.|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> {{much more}} <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> say {{in praise of}} {{travelling}} on our own neglected legs? But it is getting late; dark night-clouds are marching slowly over the sky, to the whistling music of the wind; we must leave our bank by the roadside, pass {{one end of the}} old bridge, walk along a narrow winding street, and enter our hospitable little inn, where we are welcomed by the kindest of landladies, and waited on by the fairest of chambermaids. If Looe prove not to be a little sea-shore paradise to-morrow, then is there no virtue in the good omens of to-night.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> found <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> scar {{myself was}} by {{understanding}} completely that Gus {{was doing something}} to protect the family. These chemists that he’s cultivated, the people that work for him, bodyguards, and everyone else, {{the people in the}} laundry, the people in the chicken place — he cares about them. So in order to protect them, he has to do this thing, because this person has been exposed, and he’s gotta take care of business to protect the family. [...] - [...] Giancarlo Esposito ...|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> different, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but reflect, is {{all this}} from the gin palaces of London! There, there is indeed a {{dazzling}} splendor of gas light. But there is nothing artistic, nothing refined, nothing appealing to the imagination. There are only hogsheads, and barrels, and the appliances for serving out strong drink. And there, for one sole end, the swallowing of fiery stimulant, come the nightly thousands--from the gay and well dressed, to the haggard and tattered, in the last stage of debasement. The end is the same--by how different paths! Here, they dance along the path to ruin, with flowers and music; there, they cast themselves bodily, as it were, into the lake of fire.|$|R

5000|$|Erin Gruwell is {{the woman}} who began the Freedom Writers and {{compiled}} her students’ stories into The Freedom Writers Diary. She started teaching {{in the fall of}} 1994 at Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California. In interviews, she has said that she thinks she is the one who changed the most. “Everything I was told not to do, I did. They told me not to smile. I smiled. They told me never to show emotion. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be a person, though? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> be compassionate and give a student a hug when they were hurting? I changed the most. I became the student.” ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> embrace with {{grateful}} memories all the Episcopal Conferences in the world, which I met in {{the course}} of their visits ad limina Apostolorum! Besides, how could I fail to remember all the Christian Brothers and Sisters - non-Catholics! And the Rabbi of Rome and likewise all the representatives of non-Christian religions, not to mention all the representatives of the worlds of culture, science, politics and the media! ...|$|E
60|$|I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in {{representing}} to {{myself in the}} most lively colours, how I must have acted, if I had got {{nothing out of the}} ship; <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have so much as got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must have perished first: that I should have lived, if <b>I</b> had <b>not</b> perished, like a mere savage: that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, lad, I guessed as you {{had had a}} hand in the {{business}} somehow. When I was standing tied up against the mast I had to keep my mouth shut; but I had the use of my eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make you out among them. I might have missed you, of course; but your company was formed up close to where I was standing, and I thought I should have seen you if you had been there. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> think what had become of you; but when the men came pouring down again without their arms, and I heard them cursing and swearing because the sailors and the officers and all was found in readiness to receive them, it somehow came to my mind as that you was at the bottom of it--though <b>how,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{for the life of me}} make out, for I knew you had gone below when I did." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{amid all}} my {{infinite}} miseries, came sweetly the cherub Hope--for I {{thought of my}} precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid: it would <b>not</b> move. <b>I</b> felt my wrists for the bell-rope: {{it was not to}} be found. And now the Comforter fled for ever, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully prepared--and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. <b>I</b> was <b>not</b> within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from home-while among strangers--when, or <b>how,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember--and it was they who had buried me as a dog--nailed up in some common coffin--and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and nameless grave.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2011 Irish Islamist militant Khalid Kelly {{was arrested}} for {{threatening}} to assassinate Barack Obama.

50|$|Gilbert works {{mainly in}} oils on both landscapes and {{abstract}} compositions, sometimes using gold or silver leaf. Gilbert's {{view is that}} the disparate styles of his paintings reflect who and where he is. The New Forest, Gilbert's home, is a major inspiration: 'I would be a fool not to use the ever-changing colours that the seasons bring. Sunlight through the trees, early morning mists across the river, a bluebell wood right on my doorstep, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>NOT</b> paint this?'.|$|E

5000|$|Ben Stiller {{admitted}} that a sequel was [...] "a possibility" [...] and on January 22, 2010, co-writer Thomas Lennon said to Access Hollywood, [...] "That after {{the success of}} two Night at the Museum films, it's no surprise that 20th Century Fox is looking to develop a third and that those suspicions are indeed true and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> you <b>not?</b> <b>I</b> think it's a really outstanding idea to do Night at the Museum 3, in fact," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that," [...] he added with a raised eyebrow. [...] "I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It {{might be in the}} works." [...] In an interview, Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that {{it was only in the}} [...] "ideas stage".|$|R
60|$|My {{reflections}} on this theme {{were still in}} progress when dinner was announced. Mr. Waterbrook went down with Hamlet's aunt. Mr. Henry Spiker took Mrs. Waterbrook. Agnes, whom I should have liked to take myself, was given to a simpering fellow with weak legs. Uriah, Traddles, and I, as the junior part of the company, went down last, <b>how</b> we <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> was <b>not</b> so vexed at losing Agnes as I might have been, since it {{gave me an opportunity}} of making myself known to Traddles on the stairs, who greeted me with great fervour; while Uriah writhed with such obtrusive satisfaction and self-abasement, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gladly have pitched him over the banisters. Traddles and I were separated at table, being billeted in two remote corners: he in the glare of a red velvet lady; I, in the gloom of Hamlet's aunt. The dinner was very long, and the conversation was about the Aristocracy--and Blood. Mrs. Waterbrook repeatedly told us, that if she had a weakness, it was Blood.|$|R
60|$|This {{ceremony}} concluded, the two attendant women led {{her round}} the altar {{to the stone}} chair, upon which she seated herself. Next fire was kindled in the bowl on the tripod {{in front of the}} chair, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see; but perhaps it was already smouldering there. At any rate it burnt up in a thin blue flame, on to which Harût and the head priestess threw something that caused the flame to turn to smoke. Then Isis, for I prefer to call her so while describing this ceremony, was caused to bend her head forward, so that it was enveloped in the smoke exactly as she and I had done some years before in the drawing-room at Ragnall Castle. Presently the smoke died away and the two attendants with the feathered head-dresses straightened her in the chair where she sat still holding the babe against her breast as she might have done to nurse it, but with her head bent forward like that of a person in a swoon.|$|R

60|$|However, I {{did as he}} bade me, {{that you}} may be sure; and having thus taken my leave of him, I never saw him more, for he found means {{to break out of the}} bailiff's house that night or the next, and go over into France, and for the rest of the {{creditors}} scrambled for it as well as they <b>could.</b> <b>How,</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>not,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come at no knowledge of anything, more than this, that he came home about three o'clock in the morning, caused the rest of his goods to be removed into the Mint, and the shop to be shut up; and having raised what money he could get together, he got over, as I said, to France, from whence I had one or two letters from him, and no more. <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> see him when he came home, for he having given me such instructions as above, and I having made the best of my time, I had no more business back again at the house, <b>not</b> knowing but <b>I</b> might have been stopped there by the creditors; for a commission of bankrupt being soon after issued, they might have stopped me by orders from the commissioners. But my husband, having so dexterously got out of the bailiff's house by letting himself down in a most desperate manner from almost the top of the house to the top of another building, and leaping from thence, which was almost two storeys, and which was enough indeed to have broken his neck, he came home and got away his goods before the creditors could come to seize; that is to say, before they could get out the commission, and be ready to send their officers to take possession.|$|R
