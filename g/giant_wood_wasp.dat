25|$|Although Xeris {{spectrum}} {{does not}} have any symbiotic fungi, it often takes advantage of the fungal symbionts of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> species. A study of the reproductive strategies of Xeris spectrum showed that the females often lay their eggs on wood where other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps</b> of species with symbiotic fungi have already laid their eggs. This allows the Xeris spectrum larvae to benefit from the fungi. In addition, adult Xeris spectrum emerge from their holes at two different times: one group emerges in summer with the species of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps,</b> while the other group emerges the next spring.|$|R

5000|$|The Anaxyelidae are a <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> family {{within the}} Symphyta, {{containing}} {{only a single}} living species, Syntexis libocedrii, (also called the cedar <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> or incense-cedar <b>wood</b> <b>wasp),</b> though the family has an extensive Mesozoic fossil record; this species is thus a [...] "living fossil". It has the remarkable behavior of ovipositing only in recently burnt incense-cedar (Calocedrus), red cedar (Thuja) or juniper (Juniperus); the wood is often still smoldering when the wasp is laying its eggs, and the larvae develop in the wood. It occurs from the mountains of central California to southern British Columbia, but is very rarely seen, except by firefighters.|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, {{we explain}} why the low gravity {{encountered}} on Mars or on the Moon and the low mass of the probes, landers and rovers that carry drilling devices limit classical drilling techniques.

Biologists have identified the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp,</b> an insect {{that is capable of}} "drilling" into wood to lay its eggs. A low mass and low power system, like an insect, capable of drilling into wood is of the highest interest for planetary drilling and terrestrial drilling alike. The general working principle of the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> drill ("dual reciprocating drilling") will be exposed and the potential benefits of imitating the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> for planetary drilling will be highlighted. Since the nature of wood is highly fibrous but the nature of extraterrestrial and terrestrial soils are not, it is necessary to adapt the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> ovipositor to our target soils.

As a university lecturer your time is devoted of course to lecturing in your subject, and attending numerous meetings: staff meetings, tutorial board meetings and all that sort of thing which I personally detested.

And I wanted to make a stills, colour stills, record of the whole story. And I had to develop equipment for that, and it worked pretty well. Over the three or four years I got a pretty complete record of the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> and its parasites and the way they behaved. But, on the stills of course, you cannot show the real behaviour. You’ve just got a series of shots that are a fraction in time, whereas you want to show exactly what the insect does and how it gets its egg to the host and so on and so forth...|$|R
