Normally the silicon acts as both the source of photoelectrons, {{as well as providing}} the electric field to separate the charges and create a current. In the <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> the bulk of the semiconductor is used solely for charge transport, the photoelectrons are provided from a separate photosensitive dye.

2500|$|Typically a {{ruthenium}} metalorganic dye (Ru-centered) {{is used as}} a monolayer of light-absorbing material. The <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> {{depends on}} a mesoporous layer of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide to greatly amplify the surface area (200–300 m2/g , as compared to approximately 10 m2/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type [...] and the holes are absorbed by an electrolyte {{on the other side of}} the dye. The circuit is completed by a redox couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by screen printing or ultrasonic nozzles, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from degradation under heat and UV light and the cell casing is difficult to seal due to the solvents used in assembly. The first commercial shipment of DSSC solar modules occurred in July 2009 from G24i Innovations.|$|E

50|$|TiO2 {{nanoparticles}} are synthesized {{in several}} tens of nanometer scales (~100 nm). In {{order to make}} a photovoltaic cell, molecular sensitizers (dye molecules) are attached to the titania surface. The dye-absorbed titania is finally enclosed by a liquid electrolyte. This type of <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> is also known as a Grätzel cell. <b>Dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell</b> has a disadvantage of a short diffusion length. Recently, supermolecular or multifunctional sensitizers have been investigated so as to enhance carrier diffusion length. For example, a dye chromophore has been modified by the addition of secondary electron donors. Minority carriers (holes in this case) diffuse to the attached electron donors to recombine. Therefore, electron-hole recombination is retarded by the physical separation between the dye-cation moiety and the TiO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 5. Finally, this process raises the carrier diffusion length, resulting in the increase of carrier lifetime.|$|E

50|$|A promising, {{emerging}} type {{of solar}} cell is the <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> This type of cell still {{depends on a}} semiconductor (such as TiO2) for current conduction on one electrode, but with a coating of an organic or inorganic dye {{that acts as a}} photosensitizer; the counter electrode is a platinum catalyst for H2 production.

50|$|Hybrid <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> {{based on}} <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> are {{fabricated}} by dye-absorbed inorganic materials and organic materials.

However, titania only absorbs {{a small fraction of}} the UV spectrum. Molecular sensitizers (dye molecules) attached to the semiconductor surface are used to collect a greater portion of the spectrum. In the case of titania <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells,</b> a photon absorbed by a dye-sensitizer molecule layer induces electron injection into the conduction band of titania, resulting in current flow. However, short diffusion length (diffusivity, Dn≤10−4cm2/s) in titania <b>dye-sensitized</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cells</b> decrease the solar-to-energy conversion efficiency.
