40|$|Infiltration is an {{integral}} part of the ventilation system and process. Infiltration affects the quality of the barn environment and can also increase the winter heating cost. Precise data on infiltration is very important in the design of ventilation systems for animal barns. Many researchers have suggested that ASHRAE’s ‘crack’ method is not suitable for predicting infiltration of animal barns. Among the available methods, pressurization methods are commonly used in infiltration quantification and the power law model gives the best prediction of the infiltration rate. For this research project, 18 swine <b>finishing</b> <b>rooms</b> and three swine gestation rooms were tested for their infiltration characteristics. At 20 Pa pressure difference across the room envelope, the average as-is leakage rate for the 18 swine <b>finishing</b> <b>rooms</b> was 6. 43 ± 1. 68 ACH; whereas, the average leakage rates through curtains, fans and other components were 1. 47 ± 0. 71 ACH (about 23...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, Winters interviewed fellow artist Kiki Smith for her eponymous book, which was {{published}} later that year. Also {{at the turn of}} the decade, Winters was invited by the Val Saint Lambert glass factory in Belgium to create glass-works. The artist continued to work with the factory for several years, making his own pieces and offering his input as a designer. Some of the works, a group of glass heads and hats, the artist made were exhibited in 1990 at the Centre d’Art Contemporain Geneve in Geneva, Switzerland. Later in the year they were included in his solo exhibition at Brooke Alexander Gallery in New York City. They were also shown at Facts and Rumours, an exhibition at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam, the Netherlands in 1991.Winters had a solo exhibition at Van Esch Galerie in Eindhoven, the Netherlands called I am not Indifferent in 1991. The show consisted of paintings, glass heads, and bronze sculpture. [...] Two years later he had another solo exhibition at the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, entitled Human Nature. Several hundred heads, made of glass and ceramic, lined the walls and were arranged in rings on the floor. Also on display were various paintings and bronzes. [...] At one end of the gallery Winters set up a work space where he also answered questions about the pieces on display and showed video of the creation of the pieces.In 1994 Winters had a show at the Michael Klein Gallery in New York City entitled Notes from the <b>Finishing</b> <b>Room,</b> a solo exhibition of paintings. [...] The artist also collaborated with fellow Benicia natives and glass artists Lee Roy Champagne and Michael Nourot to create pieces for Glass Roots, held in his hometown of Benicia, California at the Arts Benicia Center Gallery.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the aerial contaminants affecting pig activity and evaluate the correlation between pig activity and aerial contaminants in a pig confinement building. This experiment was performed in a confinement growing and <b>finishing</b> <b>room,</b> and the data presented in this article was collected over a period of 50 days, with sampling every 2 days from June to September 2003. Air samples were taken in the middle of empty pens on both sides of the pig confinement building. In this study, we demonstrated statistically significant negative relationships between pig activity and temperature, relative humidity and ammonia, while total dust positively regressed with pig activity. Based on these experimental results, we reasoned that increases in temperature, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia in the pig building suppressed pig activity and that high levels of total dust in the pig building was attributable to increases in pig activity. The exposure limit values of aerial contaminants, such as particulate matter, gaseous compounds and airborne microorganisms related to the pigs ’ health should be established in order to promote the performance and welfare of the pigs...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{workers can}} {{be exposed to}} {{hazardous}} concentrations of airborne contaminants such as, particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Exposure to these contaminants {{has been associated with}} a high prevalence of acute and chronic respiratory symptoms: coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and phlegm, as well as a reduction in lung function. Commercial low-cost indoor air quality (IAQ) monitors have the ability to detect many of the contaminants commonly found in agriculture. Limited research has been conducted on the performance of low-cost monitors in different occupational settings. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate whether the Foobot (Airboxlab, San Francisco, CA, USA), a low-cost (IAQ) monitor, is sufficiently robust to operate in agricultural environments and provide useful and accurate information to farmers. Foobots were deployed at two sites, a tractor repair shop (“Shop”) for 43 days and a <b>finishing</b> <b>room</b> in a swine production building (“Barn”) for 40 days, where they monitored PM 2. 5, CO 2, and VOCs. Reference direct-reading monitors to compare Foobot readings were collocated with the Foobots. Paired sample results were compared over 19 days at the shop and 21 days at the barn. At neither of the two sites did the Foobots meet the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) acceptable bias criterion of ± 10...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytic}} {{epidemiological survey}} {{was carried out}} in 105 French farms to identify factors associated with Salmonella shedding by finishing pigs. This study gave out a list of 7 risk factors using a logistic model. The aim of the present survey was to validate this model on a second sample of batches of pigs in order to estimate their Salmonella status. The validation study was carried out from April 2003 to August 2005 on 64 finishing pig batches distinct from those used originally to generate the logistic model. In each farm, Salmonella shedding of a batch of pigs {{at the end of the}} finishing phase was assessed using swabs as described in the analytical study. Questionnaires were filled in with the farmer to collect data related to management routines. Blood samples from 10 growing and 10 finishing pigs were taken to assess sanitary risk factors: status vs Lawsonia intracellularis and Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus. Salmonella contamination status of a <b>finishing</b> <b>room</b> before loading, a further identified risk factor, was tested by environmental swabbing procedure. The estimated risk with the standard error, of Salmonella shedding was calculated using the logistic model and compared to the bacteriological Salmonella status of each batch. Several thresholds are proposed and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values related to each cut-off value were calculated. A cut-off value of 0. 34 maximised both sensitivity (76. 9 %) and specificity (68. 6 %) of the model. Whatever the threshold, the accuracy of the Salmonella non-shedding predicted status is better than the Salmonella shedding predicted status. In a bacteriological sampling programme, this model could be a useful tool to identify batches with low risk of Salmonella shedding and to focus attention on those getting a high probability for being positive...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} an add-on project to the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) {{and focused on}} {{comprehensive}} measurement of odor emissions considering variations in seasons, animal types, and olfactometry laboratories. Odor emissions from four of 14 NAEMS sites with nine barns/rooms (two dairy barns at the WI 5 B and IN 5 B sites, two pig <b>finishing</b> <b>rooms</b> at IN 3 B, and two sow gestation barns and a farrowing room at the IA 4 B site) were measured during four 13 -week cycles. Odor emissions were reported per barn area (OU h- 1 m- 2), head (OU h- 1 head- 1), and animal unit (OU h- 1 AU- 1). The highest overall odor emission rates were measured in summer (1. 2 × 105 OU h- 1 m- 2, 3. 5 × 105 OU h- 1 head- 1, and 6. 2 × 105 OU h- 1 AU- 1), and the lowest rates were measured in winter (2. 5 × 104 OU h- 1 m- 2, 9. 1 × 104 OU h- 1 head- 1, and 1. 5 × 105 OU h- 1 AU- 1). The highest ambient odor concentrations and barn odor emissions were measured from the sow gestation barns of the IA 4 B site, which had unusually high H 2 S concentrations. The most intense odor and the least pleasant odor were also measured at this site. The overall odor emission rates of the pig <b>finishing</b> <b>rooms</b> at IN 3 B were lower than the emission rates of the IA 4 B sow gestation barns.
