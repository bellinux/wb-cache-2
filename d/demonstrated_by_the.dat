5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels.

5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently.

5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E

5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> developers' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 holiday season. According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E

An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc is <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{record of a}} successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E

There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was {{put into}} dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916.

Thereafter, the ship {{was used as a}} target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April Schleswig-Holstein was sent to Altenbruch {{at the mouth of the}} Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. Schleswig-Holstein was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Armoured Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes. However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade. The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Presbyterian {{majority}} {{was quickly}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> election of their candidate the Duke of Hamilton as President of the Convention. On 12th March, James landed in Ireland and on 16th March, his Letter to the Convention was read out, demanding obedience and threatening punishment {{for those who}} did not comply. Public anger at the Letter's uncompromising tone meant some Episcopalians stopped attending the Convention, claiming to fear for their safety while others changed sides. Tensions were high, with Edinburgh Castle held by the Duke of Gordon, Dundee recruiting Highland levies for James and fears of an Irish invasion. These factors exaggerated the Presbyterian majority in the Convention which now met behind closed doors guarded by its own troops.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains.

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{discovery}} of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E

Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, as <b>demonstrated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
