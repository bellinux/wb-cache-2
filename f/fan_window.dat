2500|$|Strickland's {{design for}} the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, and is a {{significant}} early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture. The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately {{in the north and}} south façades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the stylobate. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe Doric columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a triglyph frieze and simple triangular pediment. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway {{in the center of the}} north façade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched <b>fan</b> <b>window.</b> The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate from the exposure to the elements of weak parts of the stone. This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south façade. [...] Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{is located on}} the southwest corner of the Carrollton Public Square. It {{is a perfect example of}} the popular Federal architecture and was constructed in 1837. The central door is framed by white side windows and a <b>fan</b> <b>window</b> above. A light sandstone arch surmounts the frame. The hipped roof is framed on both sides by two large chimneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{decorative}} {{style is}} briefly continued around {{the western edge}} of the building fronting Phoenix Street. On the ground floor, the first two bays have semi-circular spoked <b>fan</b> <b>windows.</b> Above these is a semi-circular window, the same size as the two panels at the front. Originally this window was glazed but is now blanked off; the decoration is completed by a pair of oculi windows as on the front with a single arched window on the top floor.|$|R

It had four floors, five different parlours, and fifteen bedrooms with attached bathrooms. The rooms were furnished with chandeliers, potted ferns, and elegant furniture. The house was steam-heated, and each bathroom was supplied with {{hot and cold}} water.

The facade underneath the temple front is three bays wide, separated by marble pilasters. The entrance, in the central bay, is topped by a square diamond-grilled transom, and framed by a simple marble surround. The side elevations each have three tall windows, set above small basement windows. A small gable-roofed brick extension projects {{from the center of the}} rear elevation.|$|E

The rest of the canvas consists {{of a series of}} geometric forms of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave gradations that stem from the teachings of Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne. The Divisionist brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.|$|R

It is a single-story structure finished in brick with marble trim. It has a hip roof with three marble dormers over the central portion of the main facade. The entry is detailed with fluted Ionic pilasters with a recessed <b>fan</b> <b>window,</b> a form which is repeated in the flanking windows. The main lobby is finished with orange quarry tile flooring and marble wainscoting, with wood trim around the windows and plaster walls.

50|$|Sanders Store, {{southwest}} corner. Originally it {{was built}} in 1850 for a general store. In 1907 it began several years of renovations to convert it to its later use as Stafford's town hall (it has been vacant since the town moved to a newer building a short distance to the north on Route 237). Its combination of hip and gabled roof is one feature that reflects a combination of Greek Revival and vernacular influences. Other decorative touches include a cornice with pilasters supporting a large architrave, <b>fan</b> <b>window</b> with leaded glass in the north (front) gable field, and hip-roofed dormer window with diagonally muntined windows on the east elevation. An open-belfry tower with pyramidal roof on the northeast corner supports a modern fire siren.|$|E

On {{the second floor of}} the east side, the end bays have modern paired windows and the center bay has one paired and one single metal window of 1975. There are three gabled dormers each with copper louvers instead of windows. The roof is covered with red Spanish tile. The south side windows have been {{replaced}} by glass blocks while the original double board door remains in the center. The north and present front elevation on Calle Union is a gable end and is three bays wide on the first floor, two bays upstairs.

50|$|The Midland station {{closed in}} 1967, {{along with the}} line to Rowsley, and the site is now a roadway. However, the line through Dove Holes Tunnel from Chinley is still used for freight, such as {{limestone}} from Tunstead, along with the old Midland branch into Buxton {{and part of the}} old Ashbourne Line (closed to passengers in October 1954), which remains in use to serve a lime works at Dowlow and the quarry at Hindlow. These both join the main line just outside the station, where there also a number of sidings to allow trains to reverse. The bay platform formerly used by Ashbourne line trains and the connecting curve from it towards Dowlow have been removed, though it is still possible to trace its route. The LNWR station now handles local trains into Manchester, using its line through Dove Holes and Chapel-en-le-Frith. The surviving LNWR <b>fan</b> <b>window</b> has been restored and the external stonework cleaned.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrain heap {{contains}} high-grade grain, {{weed and}} grain impurities. At the preliminary stage of grain processing, {{it is necessary}} to clean the grain heap and allocate the fraction of light waste grain impurities which are a valuable food for farm animals. This paper proposes a technical solution for the implementation of this process and derives a mathematical model thereof. The authors analyze the modeled process of grain impurities allocation from the fraction of light waste sediment {{in the area of the}} suction port flow fan. The results of modeling are verified by comparison to experimental data. It is found out that the results of theoretical studies fit the ± 10 % tolerance of the experimental data difference. The agreement between the theoretic generated and the experimental results on the hypothesis on the samples belonging to the same general population based on the sign test is considered acceptable. The resultant mathematical model adequately describes the process of fractionation of light waste in the sedimentary area of the suction chamber in diametrical <b>fan</b> <b>window...</b>|$|E
