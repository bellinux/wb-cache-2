40|$|Two {{sources of}} {{wastewater}} <b>from</b> the <b>Eastern</b> and Western treatment plant of Alexandria city {{were used for}} irrigation of Acacia saligna and Leucaena leucocephala seedlings either directly (100 %) or mixed with tap water (50 % v/v) in addition to using tap water only as the control. Irrigation with 100 % concentration of wastewater <b>from</b> the <b>Eastern</b> sewage treatment station at 100 % concentration decreased the growth of Acacia saligna seedlings. Sewage effluent had increased specific gravity in all the treatments except with low concentration <b>from</b> the <b>Eastern</b> source; Fiber length was increased when the seedlings were irrigated with wastewater <b>from</b> the <b>eastern</b> sewage treatment station at 100 % concentration. The growth of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings decreased when irrigated with wastewater, the decrease was more pronounced with wastewater <b>from</b> the <b>eastern</b> sewage treatment station at 50 % concentration. Wastewater did not affect specific gravity of Leucaena leucocephala seedlings; however wastewater from the Western sewage treatment plant at 50 % concentration increased fiber length of those seedlings...|$|R

5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions <b>from</b> <b>eastern</b> and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east.

5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring <b>from</b> <b>Eastern</b> Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was {{the site}} of the Red River Rebellion, a {{conflict}} between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers <b>from</b> <b>eastern</b> Canada.

On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city.|$|E

5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur <b>from</b> <b>eastern</b> Asia to be discovered.

Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late Jurassic period than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E
