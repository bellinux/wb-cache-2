Her character became very prominent in 2000-2001, {{and the debate}} stirred by the violent realism led her to become, together with Langlais, {{a spokesperson for the}} government-funded TV program Parler, c'est <b>grandir,</b> a broadcast aimed at youngsters from unstable backgrounds. In 2001, she applied for the ITHAKA program and took a six-month break in Greece to devote herself to travel and academics, after which she played Donalda in Charles Binamé's epic, Séraphin: Heart of Stone (2002). She was cast as an FLQ terrorist in the 2006 miniseries October 1970 on CBC's English network. Vanasse appeared in such Canadian productions as Sans Elle, Ma fille, mon ange, and the Canadian/American/British mini-series Killer Wave.|$|E
50|$|Firdaus Kanga {{was born}} with osteogenesis imperfecta, a {{condition}} also known as brittle bones disease. This left him with several painful fractures throughout his childhood and adolescence in India. He {{grew up in a}} family of five, in a one bedroom Bombay apartment. He spoke out against the Indian socialist consensus, and was a supporter of Reagan and Thatcher politics. Kanga's first major achievement was Trying to Grow (also translated into French <b>Grandir</b> and Italian) a novel exploring disability, sexuality and culture. In India where religion still dictates most cultural acts, Kanga's novel broke several taboos - portraying disabled people with healthy, rich sexual appetites. Kanga publicly rejected Hindu notions of karma (laying responsibility for suffering at what humans may have done in their last birth) often foisted on disabled people. Kanga {{was one of the first}} few public figures in India who stood up for the views of gay people, celebrating sexuality, in a society that still criminalizes, though hardly, if ever, prosecutes homosexuality.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{the word}} grand is written grant in medieval manuscripts (grant served for both {{masculine}} and feminine gender). The orthography of that age was more phonetic; the word was in all likeliness pronounced , with an audible final , {{at least until the}} twelfth century. When that consonant became mute (like the majority of ancient final consonants in French), the word continued to be written grant (the preservation of this written form is explained by other reasons; see note), and then became grand by influence of its Latin etymology grandis, with a new (analogic) feminine form grande. The current spelling with a final mute d allows to better show the alternation between grand and grande (an alternation gran ~ grande or grant ~ grande would look less regular to the eye), as well as the lexical relation to grandeur, <b>grandir,</b> grandiloquent, etc. The root grand is written thus regardless of whether the d is pronounced , [...] or mute in order for its derivatives to have a single graphic identity, which facilitates memorization and reading.|$|E

The video {{was shot in the}} Parc de l'Abbaye in Chaalis, in the Oise department, France. The video shows the singer, first alone in a boat on a foggy lake and then with a horse she tries to tame; she alternatively can be seen walking in a forest and whispering in the horse's ear. Many features recall some of Farmer's 1980s and 1990s videos, particularly the ones for the singles [...] "Plus <b>grandir</b> in 1985, [...] "Libertine" [...] in 1986, [...] "Tristana" [...] in 1987, [...] "Ainsi soit je...", [...] "Pourvu qu'elles soient douces" [...] in 1988, [...] "Allan" [...] and [...] "À quoi je sers..."

40|$|Presentation at Open Repositories 2014, Helsinki, Finland, June 9 - 13, 2014 DSpace Interest Group PresentationsDSpace-CRIS is a {{recently}} released research {{information management system}} that combines the agile Open Access content management provided by the DSpace repository platform with additional CERIF-compliant CRIS features (CRIS: Current Research Information System) built on top. These include basic CERIF entities like persons, organisations and projects. Being {{at the same time}} a repository and a CRIS system, DSpace-CRIS may both be considered (and used like) an enhanced repository and an open source CRIS. This contribution will describe the way the DSpace-CRIS platform has been configured to serve the purposes of an organisation quite different from those which usually run institutional repositories, ie universities and research centres. Specific project aspects will be addressed such as the advantages provided by the internal character of the documentation which relieves the initiative from copyright-related concerns, the vast improvement in euroCRIS output visibility achieved by the sheer metadata assignation to existing files hidden in the organisation's CMS or the opportunities offered by the CRIS side of the platform to improve euroCRIS administration.

40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceWINPOWER {{project is}} a French national project funded by ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) that aims at developing a wide control strategy to manage large scale High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) multi-terminal networks that will interconnect renewable energy sources (RES) to the main power network. The consortium is composed of french academic and industrial partners: EECI (European Embedded Control Institute), SUPELEC (École Supérieure d'Électricité), CEA (Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives), CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientique, ARMINES (Mines ParisTech), Winnove (Groupe <b>Grandir</b> Conseil), Alstom, EDF (Électricité de France). Proposed work deals with control strategies in a wide sense, from off-line optimization of network itself before its construction; to real time, multi layered, decentralized stabilizing control that is embedded into its components. This DC grid will allow for multi-RES generators efficient interconnection, for example offshore Wind Farms (WF) and solar plants. This DC grid will also manage their connection to: the main AC grid; large loads (big cities or industrial facilities); other DC grids like a future European SuperGrid. Northern Europe's RES will likely be implemented through the "Baltic interconnection", integrating offshore wind farms using DC networks. But most HVDC links are bi-terminal (one sending and one receiving). Moving forward, this will economically and technically lead to an under-optimal scheme, therefore leading to prefer migration toward multi-terminal DC networks. However scientific and technical literature did not yet solve voltage and power quality control on multi-terminal DC networks. Solving such problems requires a complete new system thinking and testing, bringing together industry and utility players from generation and transmission as well as academic research that brings theoretical support to platform experimentations. The project will show how stability can be obtained with already used technology such as high voltage direct current (DC) equipments and systems, or AC/DC mixed systems and networks. To obtain these objectives, new control schemes are envisaged to cope with large scale networked power systems issues like delayed remote information, uncertainties, interconnected nonlinear dynamics and mixed time scales. It will allow players along the value chain to position products and service offers according to their specific know-how and business models. As a consequence, a broad decentralized and intercommunicating strategy is necessary to target building a global European HVDC system infrastructure...|$|E
