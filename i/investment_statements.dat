Our purpose for transforming the traditional two-dimension portfolio selection problem into a mixed-integer multiobjective optimisation problem in space is twofold: 1) to incorporate three objective functions in the decision process beyond the mean-variance approach, i. e., an additional measure of return, the portfolio's relative dividend yield, 2) to model even the most complex preferences that the investor may express, regarding specific cardinal constraints.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{actively}} managed investments generally carry more risk and lower returns than globally diversifi ed, risk-calibrated index portfolios. Despite this fact, governing boards of retirement plans, foundations and endowments frequently fall prey to manager picking consultants and the allure of past winners, hiring the hottest new fund managers only to fi re them later because their past performance doesn’t persist in the subsequent periods. A recent study conducted by Amit Goyal of Emory University and Sunil Wahal of Arizona State University found that manager hiring and fi ring decisions made by consultants and board members of retirement plans, endowments, and foundations was a complete waste of money and the board members precious time. “The Selection and Termination of Investment Management Firms by Plan Sponsors ” reveals the negative impact of manager chasing. The results, as set forth in Figures 5 -A and 5 -B, demonstrate that during the ten-year period from 1994 through 2003, consultants and boards which based their fund manager hiring decisions on consistent above benchmark past performance were largely disappointed with subsequent results. They often then fi red their managers in favor of another recent top performer, only to fi nd that the one they fi red actually outperformed the ones they hired.
