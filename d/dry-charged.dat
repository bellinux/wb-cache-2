40|$|During {{storage of}} {{partially}} wet-charged and <b>dry-charged</b> lead-acid batteries, processes take place {{which lead to}} self-discharge and passivation of the plates. In the case of partially wet-charged batteries, PbSO ~ crystals form in the separators during storage. When the battery is subjected to charge and overcharge they transform into Pb and PbO~ and cause short circuits between the plates {{and the failure of}} the battery. Self-discharge r actions are presented for the two kinds of plates. The capacity loss during storage is reversed upon charge of the battery. The passivation phenom-ena are determined by the structure of the two kinds of plates. The passivation of the positive plate manifests itself by an abrupt fall of its discharge potential. It is assumed that {{this is due to the}} formation of a nonstoichiometric oxide following a reaction between the grid and PbO 2 of the corrosion layer. This oxide has a high electric resistivity. Upon charge it is oxidized to PbO ~ by the O atoms and O- radicals which have first formed upon anodic polarization. They penetrate through the corrosion layer and oxidize it. The plate is depassivated with a sharp rise of its discharge potential. The passivation of the negative plate brings about the shortening of the discharge time without changing substantially the discharge potential. It is assumed that passivation is caused by the formation of a PbO film at the interface between the skeleton and energetic structures of the lead active mass. These films interrupt he electric contact hus decreasing the plate capacity. Upon charge the PbO film is reduced to lead and the electronic ontac...|$|E

2500|$|Stearic acid is {{also used}} as a {{negative}} plate additive {{in the manufacture of}} lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. [...] It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during <b>dry-charging</b> process. [...] It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. [...] As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive.|$|R
60|$|A half-hour {{devoted to}} {{wringing}} my clothing and <b>dry-charging</b> my revolver, {{and we were}} away. A brisk canter of a half-hour under the arches of the trees brought us to the river, where it was our ill luck to find a boat and three soldiers of our brigade. These men had been for several hours concealed in the brush patiently watching the opposite bank in the amiable hope of getting a shot at some unwary Confederate, but had seen none. For a great distance {{up and down the}} stream on the other side, and for at least a mile back from it, extended cornfields. Beyond the cornfields, on slightly higher ground, was a thin forest, with breaks here and there in its continuity, denoting plantations, probably. No houses were in sight, and no camps. We knew that it was the enemy's ground, but whether his forces were disposed along the slightly higher country bordering the bottom lands, or at strategic points miles back, as ours were, we knew no more than the least curious private in our army. In any case the river line would naturally be picketed or patrolled. But the charm of the unknown was upon us: the mysterious exerted its old-time fascination, beckoning to us from that silent shore so peaceful and dreamy in the beauty of the quiet Sunday morning. The temptation was strong and we fell. The soldiers were as eager for the hazard as we, and readily volunteered for the madmen's enterprise. Concealing our horses in a cane-brake, we unmoored the boat and rowed across unmolested.|$|R
