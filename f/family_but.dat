Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads.

5|$|Ecgric was {{a member}} of the Wuffingas royal <b>family,</b> <b>but</b> his exact descent is not known, as the only {{information}} historians have is from Bede, who named him as Sigeberht's cognatus or 'kinsman'.

He was the first official photographer to be appointed by the British military, and produced several thousand images between 1915 and 1918, more than a tenth of all British official photographs taken during the war. His work was often posed and formal, but several of his less conventional images are marked by a distinctive use of silhouette. Before and immediately after the war he worked as an official photographer to the Royal <b>Family,</b> <b>but</b> was dismissed from this appointment and stripped of his official honours in 1925.|$|E
