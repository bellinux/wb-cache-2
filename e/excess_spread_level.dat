5000|$|The <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> is the {{difference}} between the interest rate received on the underlying collateral and the coupon on the issued security. It is typically one of the first defenses against loss. Even if some of the underlying loan payments are late or default, the coupon payment can still be made. In the process of [...] "turboing", <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> is applied to outstanding classes as principal.|$|R
5000|$|Another way {{to enhance}} credit {{protection}} is to issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate than the underlying mortgages. For example, if the weighted average interest {{rate of the}} mortgage pool is 7%, the CMO issuer could choose to issue bonds that pay a 5% coupon. The additional interest, referred to as [...] "excess spread", is placed into a [...] "spread account" [...] until {{some or all of}} the bonds in the deal mature. If some of the mortgage loans go delinquent or default, funds from the <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> account can be used to pay the bondholders. <b>Excess</b> <b>spread</b> is a very effective mechanism for protecting bondholders from defaults that occur late in the life of the deal because by that time the funds in the <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> account will be sufficient to cover almost any losses.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{takes an}} option-theoretic {{approach}} {{to explain why}} pricing anomalies are observed when traditional CAPM is used. By extending CAPM to incorporate the option-risk factor of stocks, we show that stockholders' limited liability can explain Fama and French's size and value effects. We use bonds' <b>excess</b> credit <b>spread</b> {{as a proxy for}} stocks' default risk to control for the changing non-diversifiable option-risk characteristic of stocks. Because sensitivity to the <b>excess</b> credit <b>spread</b> becomes smaller as size increases and as value decreases, <b>excess</b> credit <b>spread</b> explains the CAPM anomalies in a fashion similar to the Fama-French factors. While the <b>excess</b> credit <b>spread</b> is significant in explaining Fama and French's size and value effects, adding the Fama-French factors does not improve the performance of our model. Our revised model resembles conditional CAPM, but it offers a more intuitive explanation for the size and value effects. Credit spread Option-risk factor CAPM Size effect Value effect...|$|R

In four relatively independent chapters, {{we look at the}} predicting power of yield spread implied ratings, Markov property of credit ratings and the dynamics of yield spreads. In the first chapter, we develop an implied rating for a large dataset of Eurobonds based on their yield spreads, taking into account the term structure effect and the time-varying <b>spread</b> <b>levels.</b> Our analysis shows that spread implied ratings and the time-varying <b>spread</b> <b>levels.</b> Our analysis shows that spread implied ratings are able to predict the future movements of agency ratings. When the spread implied rating is persistently different from the agency rating, it is very likely that if there is an agency rating adjustment, it will be in the direction that the spread implied rating points to. Both upgrade and downgrade are anticipated by spread-implied ratings well ahead of the events. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

A {{recently}} described selective {{tibial nerve}} block at the popliteal crease presents {{a viable alternative}} to sciatic nerve block for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. In this two-part investigation, we describe the effects of a tibial nerve block at the popliteal crease. Methods. In embalmed cadavers, after the ultrasound-guided dye injection the dissection revealed proximal spread of dye within the paraneural sheath. Consequentially, in the clinical study twenty patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty received the ultrasound-guided selective tibial nerve block at the popliteal crease, which also resulted in proximal spread of local anesthetic. A sensorimotor exam was performed to monitor the effect on the peroneal nerve. Results. In the cadaver study, dye was observed to spread proximal in the paraneural sheath to reach the sciatic nerve. In the clinical observational study, local anesthetic was observed to spread a mean of 4. 7 + 1. 9 (SD) cm proximal to popliteal crease. A negative correlation was found between the <b>excess</b> <b>spread</b> of local anesthetic and bifurcation distance. Conclusions.

40|$|New {{evidence}} is {{reported on the}} empirical success of structural models in explaining changes in corporate credit risk. A parsimonious set of common factors and company-level fundamentals, inspired by structural models, was found to explain more than 54 percent (67 percent) {{of the variation in}} credit-spread changes for medium-grade (low-grade) bonds. No dominant latent factor was present in the unexplained variation. Although this set of factors had lower explanatory power among high-grade bonds, it did capture most of the systematic variation in credit-spread changes in that category. It also subsumed the explanatory power of the Fama and French factors among all grade classes. e report our assessment of the empirical success of structural models in explain-ing changes in corporate credit spreads. We focus on the change in the credit <b>spread,</b> not its <b>level.</b> 1 The difference between study-ing <b>spread</b> <b>levels</b> and studying <b>spread</b> changes is equivalent to the difference between studying equity prices and studying equity excess returns. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the <b>spread</b> <b>level</b> and the bond price, whereas changes in credit spreads are directly associated with bond excess returns. 2 Therefore, credit-spread changes are the focus in bond pricing and, like expected equity returns in equity analysis, are the key to characteriz-ing the risk–return trade-off in corporate bond mar-kets, fixed-income portfolio allocation, credit-risk management, and credit-derivatives pricing. So, what drives credit-spread changes? Early studies by Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974) introduced “structural ” models to explain corporate default risk and inspired the search for company-level and macro variables, such as stock volatility, company leverage, and interest rates, that could drive the changes in corporate credit spreads. From among the various approaches to evalu-ating structural models (e. g., Eom, Helwege, and Huang 2004; Schaefer and Strebulaev 2004), we adopted the view that structural models are empir-ically successful in corporate bond pricing if they use variables that capture the variation in credit-spread changes. Using this approach, Collin-Dufresne...|$|R

This new model is set in the context of other hybrid defaultable bond pricing models and empirically compared to specific representatives. We find that a model based only on firm-specific variables is unable to capture changes in credit spreads completely.

Stock market volatility determines ASW spread changes in turbulent periods whereas stock returns tend to affect spread changes in periods of lower volatility. Whilst market liquidity affects spreads only in turbulent regimes the level of interest rates is an important determinant of spread changes in both regimes. Finally, we identify stock returns, lagged ASW <b>spread</b> <b>levels,</b> and lagged volatility of ASW spreads as major drivers of the regime shifts. JEL classification: C 13, C 32, G 1...|$|R
