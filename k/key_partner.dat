25|$|In {{his early}} work, Conn studied {{numerous}} aspects of plasma for fusion applications, including {{how it can}} be confined with magnetic fields, thereby increasing its density and the likelihood that atomic nuclei collide and fuse. Conn also studied the boundary conditions between the plasma and the chamber walls inside a reactor, how to design the so-called “blanket region” surrounding the plasma chamber so as to capture the fusion energy released as neutrons, and many other science and engineering challenges associated with practical reactor development. Among the many reports for which Conn played a central role was the UWMAK-1 Study in 1973, which became a tutorial on reactor design used by private sector companies including Westinghouse and McDonald Douglas. His <b>key</b> <b>partner</b> in these studies was Professor Gerald Kulcinski, Grainger Professor of Engineering at UW.|$|E
25|$|While the Lavi had {{attracted}} the steadfast support of IAF veteran and Likud minister Moshe Arens, {{there was considerable}} dissent over the development. While the U.S. was a <b>key</b> <b>partner</b> in the aircraft's development, there was vocal political opposition to financing the Lavi, {{which may have been}} a competitive aircraft in the export market against American aircraft such as the F-16C/D and the F/A-18C/D. The Lavi would have also required a great deal of other competing military requirements and sought investments to be abandoned, thus there were elements of the armed forces that did not support the project and those officers who felt that the F-16 possessed similar performance to the Lavi and was readily available already, making the foreign F-16 cheaper and easier to procure. IAF Major General Avihu Ben-Nun argued in favour of canceling the Lavi and acquiring 75 F-16s instead.|$|E

25|$|By {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was {{developing}} close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the Sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a <b>key</b> <b>partner</b> in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 Lebanon conflict. Beirut became a destination for Maronite Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on Mount Lebanon and in Damascus. This in turn altered the ethnic composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future ethnic and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realization amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability.|$|E
