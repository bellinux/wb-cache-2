5000|$|... 1. Silica Microstructured fibers for temperature-insensitive {{optical sensors}} - a new {{pressure-sensitive}} and temperature-insensitive optical fibre sensor has been developed. The sensor uses a <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> written into a microstructured fiber. The pressure sensitivity exceeds the state-of-the-art with {{a factor of}} 20, whilst the sensor is truly temperature-insensitive. The sensor {{is based on a}} novel design of a highly birefringent (10−3) microstructured optical fibre sensor that is designed to have a high pressure sensitivity (3.3 pm/bar), whilst at the same time exhibit negligible temperature sensitivity (10−2 pm/K). The fabrication method is compatible with conventional ultraviolet grating inscription setups for <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> manufacture. The temperature insensitivity was achieved by tailoring the design of the doped region in the core of the microstructured fiber via a series of design iterations.|$|E
50|$|These {{revolutions}} {{function as}} would a <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating.</b> The density of twists per inch, or periodicity, demonstrably {{results in the}} light being coupled to the fiber cladding, scattered out of the fiber, or reflected back within the fiber. This interaction with light can be harnessed to produce sensors, polarizers/isolators, and filter/lasers, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The first in-fiber Bragg grating was {{demonstrated}} by Ken Hill in 1978. Initially, the gratings were fabricated using a visible laser propagating along the fiber core. In 1989, Gerald Meltz and colleagues demonstrated {{the much more}} flexible transverse holographic inscription technique where the laser illumination came {{from the side of}} the fiber. This technique uses the interference pattern of ultraviolet laser light to create the periodic structure of the <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fiber-optic sensors {{have been}} {{developed}} to measure co-located temperature and strain simultaneously with very high accuracy using fiber Bragg gratings. This is particularly useful when acquiring information from small or complex structures. <b>Fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> sensors are also particularly well suited for remote monitoring, and they can be interrogated 250 km away from the monitoring station using an optical fiber cable. Brillouin scattering effects {{can also be used to}} detect strain and temperature over large distances (20-120 kilometers).|$|E
50|$|Originally, the {{manufacture}} of the photosensitive optical fiber and the 'writing' of the <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> were done separately. Today, production lines typically draw the fiber from the preform and 'write' the grating, all in a single stage. As well as reducing associated costs and time, this also enables the mass production of fiber Bragg gratings. Mass production is in particular facilitating applications in smart structures utilizing large numbers (3000) of embedded fiber Bragg gratings along a single length of fiber.|$|E
50|$|A {{demultiplexer}} can {{be achieved}} by cascading multiple drop sections of the OADM, where each drop element uses an FBG set to the wavelength to be demultiplexed. Conversely, a multiplexer {{can be achieved}} by cascading multiple add sections of the OADM. FBG demultiplexers and OADMs can also be tunable. In a tunable demultiplexer or OADM, the Bragg wavelength of the FBG can be tuned by strain applied by a piezoelectric transducer. The sensitivity of a FBG to strain is discussed below in <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> sensors.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, {{the first}} Raman fiber laser based on <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings</b> has been made. <b>Fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings</b> are {{narrow-band}} reflectors {{and act as}} the mirrors of the laser cavity. They are inscribed directly into {{the core of the}} optical fiber used as the gain medium, which eliminates substantial losses that previously arose due to the coupling of the fiber to external bulk-optic cavity reflectors.|$|R

Several implemented examples are also presented, like the deformation monitoring of one historical building with reduced visual impact, the unidirectional acceleration measurements in a metallic bridge structure and the bidirectional acceleration monitoring in a 50 m mobile telecom tower. Finally, the implementation of an automated remote structural health monitoring system design to operate with optical sensors in a highway bridge is described.

50|$|A {{photomask}} {{having the}} intended grating features {{may also be}} used in the manufacture of <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings.</b> The photomask is placed between the UV light source and the photosensitive fiber. The shadow of the photomask then determines the grating structure based on the transmitted intensity of light striking the fiber. Photomasks are specifically used in the manufacture of chirped <b>Fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings,</b> which cannot be manufactured using an interference pattern.|$|R
50|$|Fiber Bragg {{gratings}} {{can then}} be used as direct sensing elements for strain and temperature. They {{can also be used}} as transduction elements, converting the output of another sensor, which generates a strain or temperature change from the measurand, for example <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> gas sensors use an absorbent coating, which {{in the presence of a}} gas expands generating a strain, which is measurable by the grating. Technically, the absorbent material is the sensing element, converting the amount of gas to a strain. The Bragg grating then transduces the strain to the change in wavelength.|$|E

Sensing {{system for}} {{multimode}} polymer fiber Bragg gratings - <b>Fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>Grating</b> sensors {{are commonly used}} for strain and temperature sensing but pressure sensing can be more challenging especially when space is limited. The PHOSFOS project consortium developed a new polymer multipoint FBG sensor that can measure the pressure in various medical applications. The fact that polymer fiber is used rather than silica fiber is beneficial in terms of patient safely. The low Young's modulus of polymer fiber improves the strain transfer from the surrounding medium to the sensors.|$|E
5000|$|Recently the {{development}} of high power fiber lasers has generated {{a new set of}} applications for fiber Bragg gratings (FBG’s), operating at power levels that were previously thought impossible. In the case of a simple fiber laser, the FBG’s can be used as the high reflector (HR) and output coupler (OC) to form the laser cavity. The gain for the laser is provided by a length of rare earth doped optical fiber, with the most common form using Yb3+ ions as the active lasing ion in the silica fiber. These Yb-doped fiber lasers first operated at the 1 kW CW power level in 2004 [...] based on free space cavities but were not shown to operate with <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> cavities until much later.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings</b> can be {{used for}} {{monitoring}} different parameters {{in a wide variety of}} materials and constructions. The interrogation of <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings</b> traditionally consists of an expensive and spacious peak tracking or spectrum analyzing unit which needs to be deployed outside the monitored structure. We present a dynamic low-cost interrogation system for <b>fiber</b> <b>Bragg</b> <b>gratings</b> which can be integrated with the fiber itself, limiting the fragile optical in- and outcoupling interfaces and providing a compact, unobtrusive driving and read-out unit. The reported system is based on an embedded Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) which is tuned dynamically at 1 kHz and an embedded photodiode. Fiber coupling is provided through a dedicated 45 ° micromirror yielding a 90 ° in-the-plane coupling and limiting the total thickness of the fiber coupled optoelectronic package to 550 µm. The red-shift of the VCSEL wavelength is providing a full reconstruction of the spectrum with a range of 2. 5 nm.
