40|$|A {{computational}} {{model of the}} gearshifting mechanism may speed up {{the development of a}} new gearboxes. However, such model should be verified against other models as well as validated against experiments to ensure reasonable accuracy. In this contribution, results from the previous developed mathematical model of a generic synchronizer (gearshifting mechanism) against the model developed at Scania is presented. The mathematical model is based on constrained Lagrangian formalism (CLF) and the generic synchronizer is consist of <b>engaging</b> <b>sleeve,</b> synchronizer ring and the gearwheel with dimensions relevant to that of a heavy truck...|$|E
40|$|Robust and {{efficient}} synchronizers are keys elements to ensure good gear shift in heavy vehicles. In {{order to improve}} existing as well as develop new synchronizers, efficient simulation tools are needed. In this contribution, a mechanical system with 5 degrees of freedom modelling a generic synchronizer consisting of <b>engaging</b> <b>sleeve,</b> synchronizer ring and gearwheel are considered. Due {{to the design of}} the different components and their interactions the synchronizing process is described in terms of different steps or phases; presynchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition and engagement. The four main phases are further divided into sub-phases. To study the whole process in a unified manner, Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) {{turns out to be a}} suitable method in which the interactions between components (sleeve, synchronizer ring and gearwheel) are described by unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates of the system during different phases. Using CLF a mathematical model of a generic synchronizer is developed and represented by the system of differential-algebraic equations. Kinematics and kinetics of the generic synchronizer are modelled for each sub-phase. The sleeve is considered as a master and the gearwheel is considered as a slave. The statement of the dynamics problem for a generic synchronizer is given and the numerical algorithm is implemented in Matlab for solving the differential-algebraic equations resulting from CLF. The generic synchronizer computational model is adapted to available experimental setup and validated using obtained measurement data. Sensitivity of the synchronization time is studied varying the cone angle, coefficient of dry friction and sleeve force. Effect of driveline vibrations on synchronization performance is also studied...|$|E
40|$|Assembly guide aligns two {{mating parts}} of {{electrical}} connector to prevent bending of connector pins. Consists of two closely fitting cylindrical sleeves, one sliding within the other. When <b>sleeves</b> <b>engaged,</b> parts of connector are concentric. Connector nut threaded into engagement, spring clips extracted, and sleeves removed from mated connector...|$|R
50|$|The Maillon (or Maillon Rapide) {{performs}} a similar function to a carabiner {{but instead of}} a hinge has an internally threaded <b>sleeve</b> <b>engaging</b> with threads on {{each end of the}} link, and is available in various shapes and sizes. They are very strong but more difficult to open, either deliberately or accidentally, so are used for links which {{do not need to be}} released during normal use, such as the center of a harness.|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{abrasion}} of the sleeve, {{which is}} usually made of aluminium, caused during the drilling process, {{needs to be taken}} into account, especially for longer implants, where the drill <b>engages</b> the <b>sleeve</b> for a longer time. Horwitz et al. [24] found in their in vitro study that multiple uses of the drill and sleeve reduced the accuracy of the system. Cassetta et al. [12] using a modification on the External Hex SafeÂ® (Materialise Dental, Leuven, Belgium) system (Group A) in order to minimise tolerance and reduce friction and damaging of the sleeve by the drill motion showed statistically improved accuracy in a retrospective clinical study. This could be interpreted as the best practice being the use of sleeves for a single time and the drills for the times recommended by the manufacturer. The abrasion of the components due to usage is not incorporated in our study.|$|R
40|$|A wrench is {{described}} that is usable where limited access normally requires an open-end wrench, but which has substantially the high-torque capacity and small radial clearance {{characteristics of a}} closed-end wrench. The wrench includes a sleeve forming a nut-engageable socket with a gap in its side, and an adaptor forming a socket with a gap in its side, the adaptor closely surrounding the sleeve and extending across {{the gap in the}} sleeve. The sleeve and adaptor have surfaces that become fully engaged when a wrench handle is applied to the adaptor to turn it so as to tighten a nut <b>engaged</b> by the <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
