5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after {{two to three}} months.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
25|$|FitzMaurice went {{to make a}} vow at {{the monastery}} of the Holy Cross in Tipperary but became caught in a {{skirmish}} with the forces of his cousin, Theobald Burke, during which he was shot with a ball <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> the chest, but cut his way through to Burke and his brother William, both of whom he killed with single strokes of his sword.|$|E

25|$|The {{trees in}} the Topkapı Palace complex are remarkable, as many have fallen victim to a fungus that has {{completely}} hollowed out their trunks, {{over the course of}} centuries. The trees nonetheless survive and remain standing. In other cases, two trees of a different kind have grown and fused together, such as a fig tree that grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> another tree and effectively grafted with it. This phenomenon {{can be seen in the}} second courtyard.|$|E
25|$|Five days later, on June 13, Ja'far ibn al-Baghamardi entered Mecca with {{approximately}} two hundred riders under his command. There he {{was met by}} Harun, who {{had returned to the}} city, and was reinforced with one hundred twenty horsemen, two hundred blacks, thirty Saffarid cavalrymen, and two hundred infantry from Iraq that the governor had at his disposal. After receiving further assistance from a group of Khurasani pilgrims, Ja'far decided to march out and face the troops of Ibn Tulun. The ensuing battle, which took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> Mecca, ended in a victory for the government forces, who killed two hundred of Ibn Tulun's men and compelled the remainder to flee to the surrounding hills. As the Tulunid soldiers ran off their animals and money were confiscated, and al-Ghanawi's tent, which contained some two hundred thousand dinars, was seized by Ja'far.|$|E
25|$|As the radial {{point of}} so many ridges Scoat Fell forms the head of several valleys, the major ones being the Wasdale feeders of Mosedale and Nether Beck. Mosedale begins on the eastern flanks of Scoat Fell, between Red Pike and Pillar, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> Black Comb. There are crags in the headwall, {{particularly}} to the south. Nether Beck has its birth at Scoat Tarn, a large pool {{to the south of}} the fell. This corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines is around 65ft deep. Between Steeple and Pillar to the north is Windgap Cove with Black Crag, a Hewitt at its head. Wind Gap is the col between Black Crag and Pillar, while the small Mirk Cove lies between Black Crag and the summit. Finally Mirklin Cove is the corrie between Steeple and Tewit How, drained into Ennerdale by Low Beck. All of the northern coves are home to impressive crags.|$|E
50|$|As for the Epiphyllinae subtribe, {{these species}} {{are not easily}} {{recognised}} as cacti. They are all epiphytes, absorbing moisture through their aerial roots, and grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> trees <b>in</b> tropical forests. <b>The</b> stems develop many branches with very small, spineless areoles. The segments are generally either cylindrical, angular, or flat. The principal genera are Lepismium and Rhipsalis.|$|R
25|$|The {{identification}} of the site with Theodosius' monastery was first proposed by Yizhar Hirschfeld. Yoram Tsafrir {{has suggested that the}} monastery may have been located on the slopes below of the Temple Mount which have not yet been excavated or even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple Mount itself, within Solomon's Stables. No evidence has been found to corroborate either suggestions.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{blossoms}} from the marri {{can be used}} as a source of honey, which can be sucked directly from the flower or can be dipped into water to make a sweet drink. These blossoms also attract ngoowak (bees) and honey can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> eucalyptus branches. These trees also attract birds which nest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branch <b>hollows,</b> <b>in</b> which eggs can be found to eat.|$|R
500|$|However, the Union enthusiasm soon {{dissipated}} as {{the public}} realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles that [...] "Our army held the war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> their hand {{and they would not}} close it!" [...] Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as [...] "Chase, Seward and others," [...] disgusted with Meade, [...] "write to me that Lee really won that Battle!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{birthing}} of {{the litter}} {{of one to}} six (typically two to four) {{takes place in a}} concealed location, such as an underground den, a termite mound, a rock crevice, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a large tree (particularly those of the Commiphora genus). Contrary to older research, litters are of mixed sexes. Young are born in December or January, making the gestation period 90days, with the late mating reports indicating a gestational period of about six to seven weeks. The newborns are blind and toothless and weigh no more than [...] The fur is thin and has been described as gray-brown or nearly white. After about two weeks the cubs' eyes open, they become more active, and their fur darkens to a pearl gray. The cubs do not take solid food until three months old, and do not leave the den until they are 4.5 months old; they are weaned shortly after that. After the first year, the juveniles are independent of their mother. Permanent teeth appear at 18 to 20 months. Physical maturity is reached by about two years of age, but sexual maturity is not attained for another year or two, and the young may stay with their mother until they are fully mature. Lifespan in captivity is up to or past 20 years of age, possibly due to the slow juvenile development.|$|E
2500|$|Another unruly crowd made it {{difficult}} to hear the speeches of Antoinette Brown Blackwell, Caroline Dall, Lucretia Mott and Ernestine Rose. Wendell Phillips stood to speak and [...] "held that mocking crowd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> his hand." ...|$|E
50|$|Choerophryne microps inhabits primary {{rain forest}} at {{elevations}} of 380 - 1000 m above sea level. It {{was found to}} be locally very common, with highest abundance at intermediate altitudes (500-700 m). Males call from on or in leaf litter or rotting logs, sometimes higher from the ground (to 1 m) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> plant stems. <b>The</b> diet is dominated by small ants.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> empty <b>hollow</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stalks <b>of</b> larger bamboo {{is often}} used to cook food in many Asian cultures. Soups are boiled and rice is cooked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> fresh stalks of bamboo {{directly}} over a flame. Similarly, steamed tea is sometimes rammed into bamboo hollows to produce compressed forms of Pu-erh tea. Cooking food in bamboo is said to give the food a subtle but distinctive taste.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the fly is {{generally}} hardwood forest. It is nocturnal, resting during <b>the</b> day <b>in</b> dark, humid spots such as holes in trees or animal burrows. Oviposition and larval development {{take place in}} similar spots, often in crevices filled with organic debris. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States it is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> tree species such as laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia) and southern live oak (Q. virginiana).|$|R
2500|$|The {{first major}} American {{recording}} of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] was by Bill Carle in a 1958 Sacred Records {{album of the}} same name (LP 9018). He reprised the song on his [...] "Who Hath Measured the Waters <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hollow</b> <b>of</b> His Hand" [...] album (Sacred Records LP 9041) later that year.|$|E
2500|$|In the Qur'an, Israelites {{demanded a}} King after {{the time of}} Musa (Moses). God {{appointed}} Talut as their King. Saul was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique; {{it was a sign}} of his role as King that God brought back the Ark of the Covenant for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who takes [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> his hand. Many drank but only the faithful ventured on. In the battle, however, David slew Goliath and was made the subsequent King of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|Jefferson did not rush. He {{had breakfast}} with the legislators and began making {{arrangements}} to leave. He spent two hours gathering his papers together. When Captain Christopher Hudson rode to Monticello to warn of the imminent {{arrival of the}} British, Jefferson sent his family to Enniscorthy, a friend's estate about 14 miles away. He continued his preparations to leave, setting a horse outside his estate for a quick escape. He continually checked Charlottesville with his telescope for signs of the British. By the time he finally saw them, cavalry were already on Monticello's lawn. He quickly mounted his horse and escaped, successfully eluding the British in the woods. Oral testimony among one enslaved Monticello family indicated that Jefferson [...] "hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> an old tree" [...] on nearby Carter's Mountain.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{forms were}} {{attributed}} to various sources. The testaceans (shelled molluscs) are characterized by forming by spontaneous generation in mud, but differ based upon the material they grow in — for example, clams and scallops in sand, oysters <b>in</b> slime, and <b>the</b> barnacle and <b>the</b> limpet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> rocks. Some reddish worms form from long-standing snow which has turned reddish. Another grub was said to grow out of fire.|$|R
2500|$|The distribution: e.g., {{the rash}} of scarlet fever becomes {{confluent}} and forms bright red lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin creases of the neck, armpits and groins (Pastia's lines); the vesicles of chicken pox seem to follow <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body (they are more prominent along the {{depression of the}} spine on <b>the</b> back and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> both shoulder blades); very few rashes affect the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (secondary syphilis, rickettsia or spotted fevers, guttate psoriasis, hand, foot and mouth disease, keratoderma blennorrhagicum); ...|$|R
50|$|Also, {{given the}} {{importance}} of bats and perhaps birds for pollination, removal of native woodland is liable to have long-term negative impacts on fruit yield even if no C. brasiliense trees are physically harmed. This is true for other native pollinators, such as Melipona quadrifasciata and Scaptotrigona postica, because they utilize pequi trees as nesting sites, commonly building nests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> these trees. Conserving pollinator habitat is probably crucial for rich yields of the valuable fruits and other produce.|$|R
2500|$|Lord Voldemort {{created his}} fifth Horcrux using Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem. The diadem is {{introduced}} by name in Deathly Hallows, but actually {{first appeared in}} Half-Blood Prince, described as [...] "a tarnished tiara" [...] in the Room of Requirement. Ravenclaw's daughter, Helena, stole the diadem from her mother {{in an attempt to}} become more intelligent than her mother. She fled to Albania, where she hid the diadem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a tree when the Bloody Baron searched for her. After Helena was murdered by the Bloody Baron, she became the Ravenclaw house ghost and Tom Riddle, while a student at the school, charmed her into telling him the location of the diadem. Shortly after leaving Hogwarts and after the murder of Hepzibah Smith, he traveled to Albania and seized the artifact. Voldemort murdered an Albanian peasant to turn the diadem into a Horcrux. Years later, when Voldemort returned to Hogwarts, reapplying for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position but denied the job by Albus Dumbledore, he hid the diadem in the Room of Requirement. Because Voldemort believed himself to be the only one to have discovered the Room, he never placed any curses around the diadem.|$|E
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows it is {{revealed}} that the Grey Lady is Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost known {{to be related to}} one of the Hogwarts founders. She informs Harry that she stole the Diadem of Ravenclaw from her mother, in an attempt to become smarter than her, and then went into hiding in Albania. It was a dying Rowena Ravenclaw's wish to see her daughter again and so she sent for the Bloody Baron to look for her, knowing that he would not rest until he brought her back, partly because {{he was in love with}} her. However, she refused to come with him and, in a moment of blind rage, he killed her with a single stab wound to the chest. Overcome with remorse, the Bloody Baron killed himself using the same weapon in turn and wears chains as penitence, [...] "as he should", the Grey Lady says. The diadem remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>of</b> a tree in an Albanian forest until Tom Riddle managed to charm the story out of her ghost, the Grey Lady. Riddle, who had been seeking out historically significant objects to make into Horcruxes, later retrieved the diadem from Albania and hid it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts while visiting the castle years later.|$|E

50|$|Odd-clawed spiders are {{endemic to}} the Great Otway National Park of Victoria, Australia. They seem to prefer {{to build their}} webs near or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii), {{particularly}} in very old trees which usually have extensive hollows. Webs have also been found near hollows in mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the bases of tree ferns (Cyatheales), and even under bridges. Though in areas where old myrtle trees are abundant, these other habitats are much less inhabited. This may indicate that they are dependent on the microclimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myrtle beech <b>hollows.</b>|$|R
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, <b>the</b> ground, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> stumps.

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is {{not strong enough to}} do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors <b>of</b> caves, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|R
50|$|Contouring {{is usually}} {{produced}} {{by placing a}} warm or cool toned colour that is one or two shades darker than <b>the</b> skin color <b>in</b> areas such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheeks, {{on the side of}} the nose, and on the temples to give a shadow and slimming effect. It can be complemented with a highlighter that is one or two shades lighter than the skin color on areas of the face that is more prominent such as on the apples on the cheeks and the tip of the nose or the t-zone.|$|R
