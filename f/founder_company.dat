It is argued that future research concerning this option for reputation management should focus on (1) the good deeds done by all actors, (2) the communication measures of the actors, (3) the “multi-step-flow of communication”, and (4) the direct and indirect effects of these complex behaviours on the image of the <b>founder’s</b> <b>company...</b>|$|R

External support is available from many sources as e. g. business angels, tax advisors, chambers of industry and commerce, banks and venture capitalists. Here, the main question is, which needs do the <b>company</b> <b>founders</b> really have and which external source is preferred for a support of these needs. To answer this question an empirical study was conducted, questioning <b>company</b> <b>founders.</b> The results show that the needs of <b>company</b> <b>founders</b> for external support are on an average level. If the <b>company</b> <b>founders</b> require external help, they prefer different sources. Thus, regional networks of different actors should be set up to support the process of setting up a company.
