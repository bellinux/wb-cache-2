25|$|Agathocles {{appointed}} {{his brother}} Antander {{as the leader}} of Syracuse and left him an adequate garrison to defend the city. To prevent an uprising in Syracuse to take place during his expedition to Libya, he separated families so that one group would be left in the city and one group would join his invasion of Libya. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> who remained despised Agathocles, they would not be inclined to rebellion out of care for their relatives who were with Agathocles.|$|E

For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire {{would have to be}} thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.|$|E
25|$|As home to Pakistan's largest {{ports and}} {{a large portion of}} its {{manufacturing}} base, Karachi contributes a large share of Pakistan's collected tax revenue. As most of Pakistan's large multinational corporations are based in Karachi, income taxes are paid in the city even though income may be generated {{from other parts of the}} country. As home to the country's two largest ports, Pakistani customs officials collect the bulk of federal duty and tariffs at Karachi's ports, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> imports are destined for one of Pakistan's other provinces. Approximately 25% of Pakistan's national revenue is generated in Karachi.|$|E
25|$|All mosques have rules {{regarding}} cleanliness, {{as it is}} {{an essential}} part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as wudu. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consumers}} {{are concerned that}} yield management could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and neural networks that determine airline ticket prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of socio-economic information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using yield management are able to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known {{at the time of}} purchase.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individual}} U.S. {{states have}} the primary regulatory power {{with regard to}} marriage, the United States Congress has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, {{was followed by a}} series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level judicial ruling prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii's constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint federal income tax returns even if they filed joint state income tax returns. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013.|$|E

Insole recalled that {{there was no}} hostility towards D'Oliveira at the meeting, and pointed out that although he was not chosen in the main team, he was made a reserve. Williams, while acknowledging that there were several worthy batsmen as candidates for places in the team, asserts that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> at the meeting had only discussed the players' respective cricketing abilities, [...] "every selector must have known that by not selecting D'Oliveira they would improve the prospects of the tour going ahead."

The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>those</b> actions are physically removed from the fight."

40|$|By not {{recognising}} {{efficiency gains}} from takeover transactions as public benefits, unless those gains are {{passed on to}} consumers, the present authorisation procedure acts as a potential disincentive to takeover activity. This is undesirable. A reduction in social welfare is likely to occur if parties desist from engaging in what would otherwise be beneficial (efficiency enhancing) takeover activity. In order to promote the welfare of society to the fullest extent possible, the law should be reformed to recognise as public benefits gains in efficiency generated by a takeover, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the <b>those</b> benefits are not immediately passed on to consumers...|$|R

Furthermore, there is a zero-tolerance policy in place, which covers purely fictional children as well as real children. The possession, production, distribution, import, export, sale, or access over the internet of child pornography is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine up to A$275,000 as well as sex offender register requirements.|$|R

[...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's main problem is that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not.

40|$|We present six studies {{demonstrating that}} outcome {{information}} biases ethical judgments of others' ethically-questionable behaviors. In particular, {{we show that}} the same behaviors produce more ethical condemnation when they happen to produce bad rather than good outcomes, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the outcomes are determined by chance. Our studies show that individuals judge behaviors as less ethical, more blameworthy, and punish them more harshly, when such behaviors led to undesirable consequences, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> they saw <b>those</b> behaviors as acceptable before they knew its consequences. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that a rational, analytic mindset can override the effects of one's intuitions in ethical judgments.

30|$|Hasan ([1978]) was {{an attempt}} to {{demonstrate}} that a specifiable class of choices in a CC motivates the over-all structural shape of the text type. Predictive claims of this kind are based on an examination of the data of language use, whose systematic analysis must focus on the shared dis/similarities across the many events. The distinction between a text and a text type becomes critical. Every naturally occurring text is an individual; it will display some features specific to it, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> just <b>those</b> correlating with its material situational setting (Hasan, [1985]). The study of a unique occurrence has, no doubt, a value. But so far as the study of register variation is concerned, this is less significant than those properties shared by a number of instances: the latter alone can lead to viable statements of correlation between texts and contexts. This was the perspective adopted in the study of correlation between textual structure and the features of the CC.|$|R
