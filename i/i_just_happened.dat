500|$|In a November 2003 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace {{on the television}} news magazine 60 Minutes, Taylor claimed he hired and sent prostitutes to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game {{in an attempt to}} tire them out, and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics. He also recounted several other instances of aberrant behavior, including arriving to a team meeting during his playing career in handcuffs after spending a night with some call girls. He said, [...] "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. You know? And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to, and they just didn't happen to have the key." [...] He also said that to beat NFL drug tests, he routinely submitted the urine of his teammates.|$|E
500|$|Australia batted {{first and}} Loxton {{came in to}} bat {{in front of a}} {{supportive}} home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He made 80, putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey, who made his first Test century in his second international match, as Australia amassed 8/575. The debutant all-rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey [...] "was going along merrily and he soon settled me down". Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings. Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent, Brown threw the ball to his debutants. Johnson was given the ball first change, but failed to make an impact, so Loxton was handed his chance. He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2/61 in the first innings, removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad. In the words of Brown, the Victorian all-rounder [...] "looked twice the bowler Johnson did". The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings. The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948. He reflected that [...] "It's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be {{in the right place at}} the right time." [...] After his position in the touring party was confirmed, he continued his late-season resurgence, scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} very well {{received}} and appeared on several lists of the series' best episodes. Sancto deemed it the best episode among the first seven because its theme was presented [...] "in a chilling manner", while O'Brien ranked it as the second best. He called it [...] "an intense watch from start to finish" [...] and said [...] "it's the episode which undoubtedly packs the biggest emotional punch". Page elected it the fourth best among the thirteen episodes, asserting that it has an [...] "ability to truly disturb" [...] and [...] "has put off many a viewer as spinning on a cheap twist, but {{despite the fact that}} the episode's impact does turn on a reveal, there's little in the episode that even feels remotely done before." [...] Mat Elfring of GameSpot placed it fifth out of thirteen, labelling it [...] "the most successful horror episode [...] to date". Atad ranked it seven out of thirteen, saying it [...] "begins a dystopian horror reminiscent of 28 Days Later, but where it ends up is far more disturbing". Out of the thirteen, Hibberd ranked it eighth, highlighting its plot twist and noting that [...] "most [...] rank this episode much higher; <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to like the rest of the episodes better". Moreover, Stuart said it [...] "may be one of the best hours of TV produced [...] ". He emphasised how it transits from [...] "John Wyndham stuff" [...] to horror and then action, and commended its final twist. He concluded: [...] "The last fifteen minutes of White Bear are amongst the most blisteringly angry pieces of television I've ever seen." ...|$|E

2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you {{that you were going to}} be a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E

[...] According to Anderson, his father [...] "was a deeply troubled man... I've dealt with my rage, my pain... I was a very angry boy... When he was around he was a very explosive person." [...] Anderson used his uncle, Ivan, as his role model, he [...] "was a cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking, leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding drummer in a swing band." [...] Anderson grew up in suburban Coburg and attended Coburg Technical School before working as a fitter and turner in a factory. Initially {{he wanted to be a}} blues guitarist, [...] "I wanted to be like all the great blues guitar players, then I wanted to be like Bob Dylan, then of course... John Lennon." [...] Anderson found himself in a band with three possible guitarists and [...] "he other two were much better than me, so the only other thing we needed was a singer... had to sing 'Twist and Shout' without accompaniment. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>happened</b> to be the best one at it." ...|$|E
