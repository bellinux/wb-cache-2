5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where <b>doctors</b> were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, <b>doctors</b> successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, <b>doctors</b> performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E
5|$|Dick {{recognized}} that the bloodletting and other treatments were failing, and he proposed performing an emergency tracheotomy as a last-ditch effort to save Washington's life. Few American <b>doctors</b> were then familiar with this procedure {{and the other two}} <b>doctors</b> disapproved.|$|E

5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although <b>doctors</b> {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and <b>doctors</b> began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's <b>doctors</b> issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|Government-run {{health care}} {{insurance}} plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933.

5|$|The Nigerian {{health care}} system is {{continuously}} faced with a shortage of <b>doctors</b> known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian <b>doctors</b> to North America and Europe.

Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as {{one of the goals of}} the government.|$|E

50|$|The Eleventh <b>Doctor</b> comic stories ran {{in several}} {{regularly}} published titles: <b>Doctor</b> Who Magazine, <b>Doctor</b> Who Adventures and the American <b>Doctor</b> Who (2011).

The Eleventh <b>Doctor</b> also had the honour of featuring in an original graphic novel, The Only Good Dalek — something which hadn't happened since the Sixth <b>Doctor</b> appeared in The Age of Chaos. Though this multi-titled existence was something he had inherited from the Tenth <b>Doctor,</b> {{he was the first}} incarnation of the <b>Doctor</b> to start out in comic strips in at least two simultaneous monthly publications. He was also the first incarnation of the <b>Doctor</b> to debut in a comic strip other than the one in <b>Doctor</b> Who Magazine since the Eighth <b>Doctor</b> premiered in Radio Times. <b>Doctor</b> Who Adventures published its first Eleventh <b>Doctor</b> story several weeks before DWM launched his series of adventures.|$|R
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS <b>doctors</b> also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the <b>doctors,</b> who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS <b>doctors</b> were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room <b>doctors</b> said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase.

The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E

Only then follows the second book, The Voyages of <b>Doctor</b> Dolittle (1922), continued by <b>Doctor</b> Dolittle's Zoo (1925).

5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there {{he went to the}} hospital.

He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his <b>doctors</b> and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E

He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the <b>doctors</b> discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the <b>doctors</b> could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|E
