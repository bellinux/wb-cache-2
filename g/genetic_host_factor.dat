40|$|Variation in genes {{underlying}} host immunity {{can lead}} to marked differences in susceptibility to HIV infection among humans. Despite heavy reliance on non-human primates as models for HIV/AIDS, {{little is known about}} which host factors are shared and which are unique to a given primate lineage. Here, we investigate whether copy number variation (CNV) at CCL 3 -like genes (CCL 3 L), a key <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factor</b> for HIV/AIDS susceptibility and cell-mediated immune response in humans, is also a determinant of time until onset of simian-AIDS in rhesus macaques. Using a retrospective study of 57 rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SIVmac, we find that CCL 3 L CNV explains approximately 18 % of the variance in time to simian-AIDS (p, 0. 001) with lower CCL 3 L copy number associating with more rapid disease course. We also find that CCL 3 L copy number varies significantly (p, 1026) among rhesus subpopulations, with Indian-origin macaques having, on average, half as many CCL 3 L gene copies as Chinese-origin macaques. Lastly, we confirm that CCL 3 L shows variable copy number in humans and chimpanzees and report on CCL 3 L CNV within and among three additional primate species. On the basis of our findings we suggest that (1) the difference in population level copy number may explain previously reporte...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Once metastasized, {{despite a}} variety of {{therapeutic}} options, the {{prognosis of patients with}} malignant melanoma (MM) is still poor. Therefore, the search for reliable markers to identify patients with high risk of disease progression is of high clinical importance. We have recently shown that TT genotypes of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T 393 C in the gene GNAS 1 are significantly associated with better outcome in {{a variety of}} carcinomas. Patients In the present study we assessed whether the T 393 C SNP is also related to the clinical course in MM. 328 patients with MM were retrospectively genotyped and genotypes were correlated with clinical outcome. Results While the allele frequency in the MM group (fC 0. 52) did not significantly differ from that of healthy blood donors, the T 393 C SNP was associated with tumor progression of MM. Carriers of the C-allele showed a significantly more severe tumor progression as estimated from the time period to develop metastasis (HR 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 2, p = 0. 017). Proportions of 5 -year metastasis-free intervals were 87. 1 % for TT genotypes and 66. 0 % for C-allele carriers. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analysis including tumor stage and melanoma subtype proved the T 393 C polymorphism to be an independent factor for metastasis (p = 0. 012). Conclusions In summary, the GNAS 1 T 393 C SNP represents a <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factor</b> for predicting tumor progression also in patients with MM; genotyping of this SNP may contribute to better define patients who could benefit from an early individualized therapy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The pro-inflammatory {{status of}} the elderly {{triggers}} most of the age-related diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, the leading cause world wide of morbidity and death, is an inflammatory disease influenced by life-style and <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors.</b> Stimuli such as oxLDL or microbial ligands have been proposed to trigger inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. It has recently been shown that oxLDL activates immune cells via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 / 6 complex.

To investigate the role of TLR- 6 we analyzed the association of the TLR- 6 SNP Pro 249 Ser with atherogenesis.

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} {{an approach}} {{for the detection}} of putative <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> that predispose patients to develop head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). METHODS: HNSCC most often result from the accumulation of somatic gene alterations found in tumor cells. A cancer-predisposing genetic background must be expected in individuals who develop multiple cancers, starting at an unexpectedly young age or with little carcinogen exposure. Genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (LOH) profiling by single nucleotide polymorphism microarray mapping was performed in a patient with a remarkable history of multifocal HNSCC. RESULTS: Regions of genomic deletions in germline DNA were identified on several chromosomes with a remarkable size between 1. 6 Mb and 8. 1 Mb (mega base-pair). No LOH was detected at the genomic location of the tumor suppressor gene P 53. CONCLUSION: Specific patterns of germline DNA deletions may be responsible for susceptibility to HNSCC and should be further analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of immune variation for the symptoms and outcome of Lyme disease, the factors influencing cytokine production during infection with the causal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi remain poorly understood. Borrelia infection-induced monocyte- and T cell-derived cytokines were profiled in peripheral blood from two healthy human cohorts of Western Europeans from the Human Functional Genomics Project. Both non-genetic and <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> were found to influence Borrelia-induced cytokine responses. Age strongly impaired IL- 22 responses, and genetic studies identified several independent QTLs that impact Borrelia-induced cytokine production. Genetic, transcriptomic, and functional validation studies revealed an important role for HIF- 1 alpha-mediated glycolysis in the cytokine response to Borrelia. HIF- 1 alpha pathway activation and increase in glycolysis-derived lactate was confirmed in Lyme disease patients.

During 1960 - 2010, a total of 22 countries in Africa reported sporadic cases or outbreaks of dengue; 12 other countries in Africa reported dengue only in travelers. The presence of disease and high prevalence of antibody to dengue virus in limited serologic surveys suggest endemic dengue virus infection in all or many parts of Africa. Dengue is likely underrecognized and underreported in Africa because of low awareness by health care providers, other prevalent febrile illnesses, and lack of diagnostic testing and systematic surveillance. Other hypotheses to explain low reported numbers of cases include cross-protection from other endemic flavivirus infections, <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> protecting against infection or disease, and low vector competence and transmission efficiency.

The recent {{identification of the}} Intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr 1) gene, which {{plays a major role}} in controlling M. tuberculosis susceptibility and infection severity in mice (Pan et al., 2005), has prompted studies on its human homolog; SP 110 in humans.

Subsequent attempts to replicate these findings in other populations, including another West African (Ghanaian) cohort (Thye et al., 2006), however, were unsuccessful. Here we have genotyped 20 SNPs located in the SP 110 gene, including the previously TB associated variants; rs 2114592 and rs 3948464, for the first time in a South East Asian cohort from Indonesia. Our study did not reveal any statistically significant associations between SP 110 SNPs and pulmonary TB.

Our results indicate that neither ABO blood group, Lewis phenotype, nor secretor status affects susceptibility to SaV infection in Nicaragua. Human sapovirus (SaV), family Caliciviridae, is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults. Symptoms of SaV infection seem to be milder than symptoms of rotavirus and norovirus (NoV) infections; thus, SaV infection prevalence is higher in nonhospitalized children than in hospitalized children. Some calciviruses bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) expressed on cells in the gastrointestinal tract (1). Human NoV strains demonstrate strain-dependent binding patterns to HBGAs (1, 2). ABO blood groups and Lewis phenotype {{also play a role}} in NoV infections, either as ligands or as restriction factors (2). Moreover, a non-sense mutation in the fucosyltransferase gene 2 (FUT 2), which gives rise to the nonsecretor phenotype, has been found to provide almost complete protection from experimental and natural NoV infection (2, 3). Although human NoV susceptibility is highly associated with secretor status, and thus with mutations in FUT 2 (4), no information is yet available on whether <b>host</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>factors</b> determine susceptibility to SaV.

Based on the CDC definition, we have developed and validated an electronic health record (EHR) based CA-MRSA phenotype algorithm utilizing both structured and unstructured data. Methods The algorithm was validated at three eMERGE consortium sites, and positive predictive value, negative predictive value and sensitivity, were calculated. The algorithm was then run and data collected across seven total sites. The resulting data was used in GWAS analysis. Results Across seven sites, the CA-MRSA phenotype algorithm identified a total of 349 cases and 7761 controls among the genotyped European and African American biobank populations. PPV ranged from 68 to 100 % for cases and 96 to 100 % for controls; sensitivity ranged from 94 to 100 % for cases and 75 to 100 % for controls.

Maximum responses were obtained with fractionated secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no single dominant antigen, but five regions of mycobacterial proteins induced high concentrations of IFN-gamma. However, {{only two of the}} five regions stimulated T cells from both mouse strains: two were exclusively recognized by T cells from BALB/c mice, and one was exclusively recognized by T cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. T cells from mice vaccinated with heat-killed M. bovis BCG organisms failed to respond to fractionated secreted proteins but recognized several somatic antigen fractions. As late as 1 year after primary vaccination, memory T cells responded to similar protein regions, and IFN-gamma production was intensified by secondary infection. Our data confirm a central role for secreted proteins in immunity to mycobacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that a major set of mycobacterium-reactive T cells is stimulated only by vaccination with live but not with heat-killed M. bovis BCG organisms. Because a major impact of <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> on antigen recognition was observed, we favor the use of live carrier organisms which secrete mycobacterial proteins over subunit vaccines as an improved antituberculosis vaccine...|$|R

This study examines time from first symptom to onset of persistent proteinuria, as a marker of renal disease, to assess which factors are important.  METHODS—The 189  patients studied were ascertained using multiple methods and included 161  white, 22  Afro-Caribbean and six Asian patients. Time of first observation of persistent proteinuria (⩾ 0. 5 g/day) was taken as onset of renal SLE. Initial univariate analysis to determine which factors are associated with onset of renal disease was followed by using a Cox's proportional hazards regression model enabling analysis of several prognostic factors at the same time. Variables included three measures of socioeconomic status, ethnic group and {{the presence or absence}} of different autoantibodies.  RESULTS—There was no effect from any socioeconomic variable. Using forwards stepwise selection, the following had independent effects (p< 0. 05) on the development of renal SLE: Afro-Caribbean race (hazard rate ratio 4. 4  (1. 9 - 10. 2), compared with white population); and the presence of IgG anti-cardiolipin antibodies (hazard rate ratio 2. 6  (1. 2 - 5. 7)).  CONCLUSION—Differing socioeconomic factors do not explain the increased frequency of lupus nephritis in Afro-Caribbean patients with SLE, but rather there are important <b>genetic</b> or other <b>host</b> differences.

However, given the rarity of MALT lymphoma of the stomach despite the high prevalence of H. pylori infection, it seems plausible that <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> might play {{a fundamental role in}} gastric lymphomagenesis. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 83 patients with low-grade gastric MALT, all of whom resided in a geographic area (southern Switzer-land and northern Italy) where the incidence of gastric tumours appears to be uncommonly high.

Available evidence suggests that indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate may be considered candidate biomarkers of the human enterotype and may help to explain the link between diet and cardiovascular disease burden. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Information on clinical determinants and heritability of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate serum is non-existing. To clarify this issue, the authors determined serum levels of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate in 773 individuals, recruited in the frame of the Flemish Study on Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO study). RESULTS: Serum levels of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate amounted to 3. 1 (2. 4 - 4. 3) and 13. 0 (7. 4 - 21. 5) μM, respectively. Regression analysis identified renal function, age and sex as independent determinants of both co-metabolites. Both serum indoxyl sulfate (h 2  =  0. 17) and p-cresyl sulfate (h 2  =  0. 18) concentrations showed moderate but significant heritability after adjustment for covariables, with significant genetic and environmental correlations for both co-metabolites. LIMITATIONS: Family studies cannot provide conclusive evidence for a genetic contribution, as confounding by shared environmental effects can never be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The heritability of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate is moderate. Besides <b>genetic</b> <b>host</b> <b>factors</b> and environmental factors, also renal function, sex and age influence the serum levels of these co-metabolites...|$|R
