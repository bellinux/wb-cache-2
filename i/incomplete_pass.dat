5|$|After Tech's kickoff was downed {{in the end}} zone, the Longhorns' offense began a new {{drive from}} their 20-yard line. Brown threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> then {{completed}} a first-down pass to Adams at the 32-yard line. From there, Brown threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> then tossed a 15-yard screen pass to Fitzgerald, who gained a first down at the Texas 42-yard line. Williams crossed into Virginia Tech territory on the next play as he ran straight ahead for a 13-yard gain. A one-yard run was followed by an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and on third down Brown threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech defender Torrian Gray, who returned the pass to the Tech 33-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass.</b> This was followed by another <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E
5|$|Having {{earned a}} first down with the final play of the first quarter, Drew Weatherford and the Florida State offense ran into {{difficulty}} as the second quarter began. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed {{to capitalize on the}} defensive stop. Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt.|$|E
50|$|Eli Manning set {{a record}} of {{futility}} in the game with 35 <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes,</b> setting a record for most <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> in an NFL game since the AFL/NFL merger. In fairness to Manning, his receivers also did not play well, dropping at least eight of his passes. Washington quarterback Todd Collins, making his first NFL start since 1997 {{in place of the}} injured Jason Campbell, didn't play much better, going 8-25, but got the win.|$|R
50|$|Cassidy {{appeared}} {{in two games}} for the Columbus Lions of the PIFL in 2012, throwing one interception on two <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes.</b>|$|R
50|$|North Carolina {{drove down}} to the FSU 12 on its next possession, but the Seminole defense forced four {{straight}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> to take over on downs.|$|R
5|$|Kelly gained one yard {{on first}} down, then Dantzler picked up 11 {{yards and a}} first down on a run up {{the middle of the}} field. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> was {{followed}} by a run for no gain and another <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass.</b> Facing fourth and goal at the eight-yard line, Bowden sent in his field-goal kicker. After the Tigers called a time out, Hunt completed a 27-yard field goal attempt and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 2713 with 7:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the 21-yard line, and Alabama again attempted to answer the Hokie score. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> Zow completed a 21-yard pass to Jackson for a first down at the 42-yard line. Alexander was stopped for a one-yard loss on a running play, then caught a pass for no gain. On third down, Zow threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> forcing another punt. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Tech 17-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began another drive.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Boston College {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession of the second half. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> by Davis {{was followed by a}} short rush and another <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went out of bounds at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession of the second half. Tech likewise went three and out, then returned the ball to the Eagles with a punt. The kick went out of bounds, and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.|$|E
50|$|Playing Time - Four 15-minute {{quarters}} with {{a running}} clock. Clock only stops for <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> {{and out of}} bounds plays during the final minute of the second and fourth quarters. 25-second play clock.|$|R
50|$|Marcus Vick {{threw for}} 172 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, going 12-of-19 (three of his <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> were dropped by receivers). Brandon Ore, who would become the Hokies' {{featured}} tailback in 2006, made his debut, rushing for 51 yards and one touchdown.|$|R
50|$|Rodney Kinlaw {{gave the}} Lions a great {{opportunity}} to tie on the ensuing kickoff with a 64-yard return, but Mills and the PSU offense came up empty with 4 <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes.</b> Finally, on the last play, QB Anthony Morelli's desperation <b>pass</b> also fell <b>incomplete.</b>|$|R
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the Tech kickoff {{and returned it}} to their 23-yard line. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> from Rix, Virginia Tech's defense was caught offsides, resulting in a five-yard gain for Florida State. A short run after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's defense, and the Hokies began their second possession {{of the second half}} at the State 31-yard line. Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position, however. Noel threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> was sacked, then threw a pass for a loss of yardage. Tech punted the ball, which was downed at the Florida State 12-yard line.|$|E
5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to start running out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do incomplete passing plays. Suggs gained nine yards on a run up the middle, then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, {{began their}} first {{possession}} {{at their own}} 37-yard line. However, a sack, a tackle for loss, and an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage and {{they were forced to}} punt. Tech punter Brent Bowden managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start at their own 14-yard line, but three big plays of 16, 19, and 19yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a fourth down. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Grieb {{was named}} the MVP, having thrown just five <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> and no interceptions {{over the course of}} the game. He was awarded a Mitsubishi Spyder for his performance. Coach Darren Arbet became the second coach to win three ArenaBowls (Tampa Bay Storm coach Tim Marcum has seven).|$|R
50|$|In 1960, Dimitroff {{came out}} of {{retirement}} {{to play for the}} newly formed American Football League. He signed with the New York Titans, but did not appear in any games for them. He later signed with the Boston Patriots and appeared in three games, throwing two <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Legal forward hand offs {{that touch}} {{the ground and}} {{attempted}} snaps when the ball hits the ground before the quarterback touches it are now considered fumbles; previously, forward hand offs were treated as <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes,</b> while a snap that hit the ground before the quarterback touched it was a 5-yard illegal procedure penalty.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-field goal kickoff, the Florida State offense began another drive. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> {{and a short}} rush, Weatherford completed a 12-yard pass for a first down as time expired in the quarter. After 15minutes of play, the score was tied 33, but Drew Weatherford had begun driving Florida State offense down the field.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{took the}} kickoff on the 39–yard line, after a Boise player {{illegally}} touched {{the ball on}} the 39. Pinkney threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> to start the drive, and after two more plays failed to convert the first down, ECU was forced to punt the ball away. After a touchback, Boise State began at its 20–yard line. The Broncos completed three plays for 11yards before the third quarter ended.|$|E
5|$|Miami {{began the}} second quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first down at the Virginia Tech 30-yard line. From there, it took Miami just four plays to score. Roan ran for seven yards, Kelly completed an 11-yard pass, threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> then Hobbs ran 12 yards for the touchdown. The score and following extra point gave Miami a 140 lead with 13:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E
50|$|The Chiefs won the toss in {{overtime}} but <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> barred them from winning their eighth {{game of the}} season. The game marked {{the second time this}} season that the Chiefs could not stop a team {{in overtime}} from advancing to the red zone and their second overtime loss from a field goal.|$|R
50|$|Legal forward hand offs {{that touch}} {{the ground and}} {{attempted}} snaps when the ball hits the ground before the quarterback touches it are now considered fumbles; previously, forward hand offs were treated as <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes,</b> while a snap that hit the ground before the quarterback touched it was a 5-yard illegal procedure penalty.|$|R
50|$|After the {{interception}} {{return the}} Colts offense took {{the field and}} managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28-yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE Dallas Clark. After a 1-yard rush and two <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> the Colt's Adam Vinatieri attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT Johnny Jolly.|$|R
5|$|Tech's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Eagles' 30-yard line. Davis started the drive with an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> then Harris gained seven yards with a rush up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and Boston College punted. The kick was fair caught at the Tech 30-yard line, and with 5:01 left in the quarter, the Hokies returned to offense. On the first play, Taylor ran 11 yards for a first down. Taylor threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> and the Hokies were penalized 10 yards for holding, pushing {{them back to the}} 31-yard line. Tech was unable to regain the lost yardage, and punted. The kick was 57 yards, and Boston College was further backed up by a penalty during the return. Following the kick, Boston College's offense was forced back to its seven-yard line to start. An <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> was followed by a scramble by Davis. During the run, Davis fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Boston College player. Facing third down, Davis scrambled again, this time for a first down to the 21-yard line. On the first play after the first down scramble, a deep pass downfield by Davis was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Stephan Virgil. The interception {{was returned}} to the Boston College 10-yard line, and on the first play by Tech's offense, Evans ran the ten yards for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:17 remaining, the Hokies extended their lead to 24–7.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{returned}} the kick to its 32-yard line, {{and on the}} first play from scrimmage, Tech sacked Brown for a loss of nine yards. Williams regained five of the lost yards, but on third down Brown threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass.</b> Texas' punt bounced out of bounds at the 33-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense returned to the field with 5:30 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} the kickoff, which Kenny Tate returned 17yards to the Terrapins' 35-yard line. Quarterback Chris Turner threw a short pass to Torrey Smith, bringing {{the ball to}} the Maryland 41-yard line, and then threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass.</b> On third down with three yards to go, Turner connected with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown pass. However, placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point.|$|E
5|$|With {{little time}} {{remaining}} before halftime, Virginia Tech used a hurry-up offense. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal {{and ran for}} 22yards on his own, but threw three consecutive <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt the ball away, and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9–0.|$|R
2500|$|Tate {{then threw}} two <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> and the Hawkeyes punted {{with a little}} more than two minutes to play. Texas, {{assisted}} by an 11-yard end-around run by flanker Billy Pitman, used all but 10seconds of the game clock before punting to Iowa. One play later, the game was over. [...] The final score was Texas 26, Iowa 24.|$|R
50|$|During passing plays, {{he moves}} forward towards {{the line of}} {{scrimmage}} as the play develops to (1) penalize any offensive linemen who move illegally downfield before the pass is thrown or (2) penalize the quarterback for throwing the ball when beyond the original line of scrimmage. He also assists in ruling <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> when the ball is thrown short.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{recovered}} {{in the end}} zone for a touchback, and the Volunteers started at their 20-yard line. Tennessee resumed running out the clock via short runs up {{the middle of the field}} that kept the game clock ticking down. After not gaining a first down, Tennessee punted to the Hokies with less than two minutes remaining in the game. Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman returned the kick to the Tech 42-yard line, and on the first play of the Hokie drive, Druckenmiller completed a 17-yard pass to the Tennessee 41-yard line. That completion was followed by a nine-yard pass to Jermaine Holmes. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> that almost was intercepted, Druckenmiller threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> before Oxendine failed to gain enough yards for a first down and Tech turned the ball over on downs. With less than a minute remaining, Tennessee's offense ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and secured a 4523 victory.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive {{started with}} a first-down pass to the Tech 42-yard line. After a short run by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide {{receiver}} Bryan Still broke free of the Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 2110 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis {{threw an}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass</b> then {{connected}} on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis {{for a first}} down. After an <b>incomplete</b> <b>pass,</b> Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced the ball to the 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time for a late scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered an intentional safety rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick {{has the potential to be}} blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, an intentional safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.|$|E
50|$|In the 2008 preseason, Daniel {{was named}} one of 26 {{candidates}} for the 2008 Unitas Award, given to the nation's best senior college football quarterback. Daniel continued to break virtually all Mizzou passing records, and in a two-game span against Southeast Missouri State and Nevada, he threw for more touchdowns (seven) than he did <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> (six).|$|R
50|$|With {{little time}} {{remaining}} before halftime, Virginia Tech used a hurry-up offense. Randall completed a 23-yard pass to Eddie Royal {{and ran for}} 22 yards on his own, but threw three consecutive <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> to end the drive. Tech was forced to punt the ball away, and the first half came to an end. At halftime, Auburn led, 9-0.|$|R
5000|$|Tate {{then threw}} two <b>incomplete</b> <b>passes</b> and the Hawkeyes punted {{with a little}} more than two minutes to play. Texas, {{assisted}} by an 11-yard end-around run by flanker Billy Pitman, used all but 10 seconds of the game clock before punting to Iowa. One play later, the game was over. [...] The final score was Texas 26, Iowa 24.|$|R
