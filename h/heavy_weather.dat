5|$|On 30 July, Winslow {{picked up}} the master and 12 crewmen from SS Whitehall, torpedoed the day before by , and brought them safely into Queenstown. She sighted another U-boat off Queenstown on 16 August, but <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> covered the submarine's tracks when it {{submerged}} and Winslow made no attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} {{forces of}} each side blundered {{into each other}} during the early morning darkness and <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> of 16 December. The Germans {{got the better of}} the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned {{about the possibility of a}} massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn. Incompetent communications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper to avoid an engagement with the battlecruisers. On 27 December, Conqueror accidentally rammed Monarch as the Grand Fleet was returning to Scapa Flow in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> and poor visibility. The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but Conqueror was not ready for service until March 1915.|$|E

5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|She was {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in February 1915 although she was being repaired after an electrical fire at the time. Rear Admiral Horace Hood took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915. The 1st and 3rd BCS sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, but failed to locate the German ships in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again {{ran into}} <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> off Cape Howe {{and was forced}} to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as Twofold Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's {{surprise}} they discovered Contest, undamaged but unable to return to sea in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>heavy</b> <b>weathering,</b> {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, {{a segment of the}} ditch 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.|$|R
60|$|The double {{water-tight}} {{bottom of}} the Livadia is three feet six inches deep at the centre, and two feet nine inches at each end. In this turbot-like lower part is the machinery, {{and it is the}} receptacle also for coals and stores of all kinds. The twofold {{bottom of the}} ship comprises forty compartments, and the whole is sufficiently strong, it is believed, to withstand the <b>heaviest</b> <b>weather</b> to which the yacht is likely to be exposed, as well as the strain of her powerful machinery.|$|R
60|$|For a {{while the}} ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom {{swinging}} to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the swell; so much <b>heavier</b> <b>weather</b> was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone {{to the bottom of}} the sea.|$|R
5|$|Betelgeuse {{first put}} in at Vigo, Spain, to change {{some of her}} crew, and then sailed for Whiddy Island on 30 December 1978. During the passage, the vessel {{encountered}} <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> in the Bay of Biscay, and after reporting a leakage of oil, was instructed to head towards Brest, France, at reduced speed. However, {{the origin of the}} leak was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in Bantry Bay on 4 January 1979.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>weather</b> in {{the form}} of monsoons in the {{northern}} half of South Vietnam reduced indigenous coastal traffic during October 1968 and the U.S. Navy's PCF support of Market Time was limited by heavy seas; however, Market Time units including Squadron One cutters fired a record number of naval gunfire missions for the sixth month in a row. The 1,027 missions conducted during October was 19 percent higher than the previous record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of 6 December, U-43 spotted a ship and pursued her {{for three and a}} half hours before firing a single torpedo, which missed. The U-boat fired another torpedo 20 minutes later, hitting the unknown ship and sinking her in 63 seconds. The vessel is {{believed}} to be the 1,902 ton Norwegian merchant ship Skrim, which had lost contact with Convoy OB-252 two days before in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> and was never seen again.|$|E

25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in <b>heavier</b> <b>weather</b> or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|R
5|$|The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, {{in which}} a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather,</b> caused the IJN to {{investigate}} the stability of all their ships, resulting {{in a number of}} design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryūjō, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, {{making it difficult to}} weather head seas in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b> Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|The first {{motorised}} snowplows {{were developed}} in 1913, based on truck and tractor bodies. These machines allowed the mechanisation of the snow clearing process, reducing the labor required for snow removal and increasing the speed and efficiency of the process. The expansion of the aviation industry also acted {{as a catalyst for}} the development of winter service vehicles during the early 20th century. Even a light dusting of snow or ice could cause an aeroplane to crash, so airports erected snow fences around airfields to prevent snowdrifts, and began to maintain fleets of vehicles to clear runways in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the quarry for protection, perhaps by the quarry workers. Despite <b>heavy</b> <b>weathering,</b> the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|R
50|$|First, in the 1890s {{major repairs}} {{were made to}} the {{brickwork}} because engineers of the late Victorian era were concerned that the original lime mortar used in the viaduct's construction was inadequate. It was decided that this should be replaced with cement mortar. However, replacement facing brickwork and substandard mortar eventually caused its own failures prompting more expensive repairs. Second, as the parapets and pavilions were made from Caen stone, a high-quality limestone, they have been subject to <b>heavy</b> <b>weathering.</b> By 1956, the damage was extensive but the cost of refurbishment work was deemed too much by British Railways, the UK's nationalised rail operator.|$|R
5|$|The {{screening}} {{forces of}} each side blundered {{into each other}} during the early morning darkness and <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> of 16 December. The Germans {{got the better of}} the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned {{about the possibility of a}} massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn's light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper's ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty's forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b> They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the semi-rigid airship N3 after it exploded in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E

5000|$|Kaolinite is very common, highly {{weathered}} clay, {{and more}} common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even <b>heavier</b> <b>weathering</b> results in sesquioxide clays.|$|R

5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered <b>heavy</b> <b>weather</b> and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
5|$|The Hawkins-class cruiser was {{designed}} to hunt enemy commerce raiders overseas. This required a large ship to provide the necessary endurance for sustained operations away from supporting bases and high speed to catch the raiders. The design was also given high freeboard {{to allow it to}} maintain its speed in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b> Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, included both coal and oil-fired boilers to provide the ship with fuel no matter the supply conditions. Four ships were ordered, named after famous Elizabethan seafarers, in 1915 and the fifth and last was ordered in April 1916, named HMS Cavendish after the adventurer and circumnavigator Thomas Cavendish. By this time the threat from German cruisers and raiders had ended, so construction proceeded slowly.|$|E
5|$|The final French {{operation}} in the Atlantic during the campaign {{was an attempt to}} send seven frigates and corvettes to the French West Indies in September, laden with supplies to help maintain the strength and morale of the garrisons. With Willaumez believed to be still at sea, September 1806 seemed a good time to send a squadron into the Atlantic, but in fact the force was spotted within hours of leaving Rochefort by the British blockade force under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood. Hood's force gave chase and the large ships of the line soon caught up the frigates in <b>heavy</b> <b>weather.</b> Sending four of his ships off in different directions, Soleil attempted to give them cover with his three largest vessels, but after a hard-fought battle in which Hood lost an arm, four of the French frigates were captured.|$|E
50|$|Miller, knowing Joyita to be {{unsinkable}} {{and desperate}} {{to reach his}} destination to clear his debt, pressed on. However, Chuck Simpson, and possibly other crew members, demanded that he turn back. This effectively led to mutiny and Miller and the crew struggled, during which Miller sustained a serious injury. By now the ship was entering <b>heavier</b> <b>weather,</b> with winds around 40 mph, and with one engine and a flooded bilge, was beginning to labor. The flooding in the engine room would have eventually caused the starboard engine to fail, also cutting all the vessel's electrical power. Chuck Simpson was now in control and {{made the decision to}} abandon ship, taking the navigational equipment, logbook and supplies, as well as the injured Miller, with them.|$|R
5000|$|The late Ordovician {{glaciation}} {{event was}} preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000 ppm to 4400 ppm). [...] The dip is correlated with a burst of volcanic activity that deposited new silicate rocks, which draw CO2 {{out of the air}} as they erode. A major role of CO2 is implied by a 2009 paper. Atmospheric and oceanic CO2 levels may have fluctuated with the growth and decay of Gondwanan glaciation. Through the Late Ordovician, outgassing from major volcanism was balanced by <b>heavy</b> <b>weathering</b> of the uplifting Appalachian Mountains, which sequestered CO2. In the Hirnantian Stage the volcanism ceased, and the continued weathering caused a significant and rapid draw down of CO2. This coincides with the rapid and short ice age.|$|R
