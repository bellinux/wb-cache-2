40|$|<b>ISO</b> 9000 <b>certification</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular quality {{assurance}} systems in the world. Despite this overwhelming popularity, there is considerable confusion and frustration surrounding the role and business value of <b>ISO</b> 9000 <b>certification.</b> A review of the literature revealed a major gap in research in this area of quality/operations management. The purpose of this study is to test the strength of the relationship between <b>ISO</b> 9000 <b>certification</b> and organisational performance in the presence and absence of a total quality management (TQM) environment. Our analysis is primarily of a large random sample of manufacturing companies in Australia and New Zealand. The central finding is that <b>ISO</b> 9000 <b>certification</b> is not shown to have a significantly positive effect on organisational performance in the presence or absence of a TQM environment. This supports the view that on average, <b>ISO</b> 9000 <b>certification</b> has little or no explanatory power of organisational performance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impacts of ISO 9001 : 2008 {{certification}} on companies in Malaysia. Data were collected from CEOs and Managers through a questionnaire survey. A multivariate analysis and SPSS macro were used as statistical techniques to assess the effects of <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification.</b> Results of the study indicate that ISO 9001 certified companies were having significantly greater benefits and financial performance compared to non-certified companies. However, no significant direct relationship between <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification</b> and company's financial performance was found. A further investigation revealed that financial performance is actually directly related to quality and local and international business performance, which are significantly influenced by <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification.</b> Therefore quality and business performances {{are involved in the}} mediational process between the financial performance of companies and <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification.</b> The novelty of this research lies in the establishment of, for the first time, high level statistical relationship between <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification,</b> its mediating factors and financial performance of companies...|$|R

The study uses a two-phase sequential explanatory mixed methods design, with quantitative data collected from 111 organisations and qualitative data collected from four organisations in the first and second phases respectively. Results show that there are significant statistical differences in the motives for obtaining <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification</b> and also show statistically significant differences in the impacts of <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification</b> based on industrial sector. These results provide a useful addition to the present knowledge in the study of <b>ISO</b> 9001 <b>certification</b> in terms of impact...|$|R
