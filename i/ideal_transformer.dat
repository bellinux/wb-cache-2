5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an <b>ideal</b> <b>transformer</b> perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discrepancy}} {{is explained}} by observing that R1 of the lower two-port has been by-passed by the short-circuit between two terminals of the output ports. [...] This results in no current flowing through one terminal {{in each of the}} input ports of the two individual networks. [...] Consequently, the port condition is broken for both the input ports of the original networks since current is still able to flow into the other terminal.

50|$|A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port {{electrical}} network element proposed in 1948 by Bernard D. H.

Gyrators permit network realizations of two-(or-more)-port devices which cannot be realized {{with just the}} conventional four elements. In particular, gyrators make possible network realizations of isolators and circulators. Gyrators do not however change the range of one-port devices that can be realized. Although the gyrator was conceived as a fifth linear element, its adoption makes both the <b>ideal</b> <b>transformer</b> and either the capacitor or inductor redundant.
