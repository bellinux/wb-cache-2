The Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and the attitude survey (for students’ preferences) towards e-learning instruction as distance education was administered to 157 students enrolled in various distance education programs at Fatih University, in Turkey. The study findings indicated that students’ cognitive style of field dependence was correlated with their attitudes and preferences for students’ roles in e-learning for distance education. Other factors such as a previous background in e-learning, including gender, educational level, use of social networks, and e-learning tools, and preferences for instructional variables and assessment in distance learning processes were also used. Finally, technological, motivational, and instructional-learning variables in <b>learner</b> <b>interface</b> design (LID) for e-learning instruction were correlated with students’ learning outcomes, attitudes, perceptions and preferences in <b>learner</b> <b>interface</b> design (LID) and attitudes toward e-learning instruction.

The natural way for an <b>intelligent</b> <b>learner</b> to counter this problem and successfully generalize is to exploit prior information that may be available about the domain or that {{can be learned from}} prototypical examples. We discuss the notion of using prior knowledge by creating virtual examples and thereby expanding the effective training set size.

The ARIADNE concept relies on a distributed knowledge pool system that stores pedagogically indexed educational resources, {{as well as on}} a set of tools and methodologies for authoring curricula. The basic approach is one of share and reuse. Specialized authoring tools are under development for the production of simulations, multiple-choice questionnaires and auto-evaluation exercises. Segmentation tools for video and text-based material, with integrated facilities for hypertext generation, are also under development. The distributed knowledge pool system consists of one central knowledge pool, and a number of local knowledge pools. Corporate training systems can also be built around private knowledge pools. Before pedagogical documents can be inserted into the knowledge pool system, their pedagogical and other characteristics must be described. A pedagogical header generator tool assists in this task. Pedagogical engineers can define the spatio-temporal, socio-pedagogic process that we call a curriculum, and choose the active and expositive documents that embody it, by using a curriculum editor.

This paper is a result of the ever changing process which shows the evolution of the assessment process to its current format. It was driven by the fact that we as lecturers realised that the assessment results did not reflect the learners’ abilities, with many bright <b>intelligent</b> <b>learners</b> failing exams, as the assessment at the time didn’t allow for a demonstration of knowledge but instead relied purely on memory recall.

40|$|Some {{disciplines}} {{are inherently}} complex and challenging to learn. This research attempts to design an instructional strategy for CBL systems to simplify learning certain complex domains. Firstly, problem transformation, a constructionist instructional technique, {{is used to}} promote active learning by encouraging students to construct more complex artefacts based on less complex ones. Scaffolding is used at the initial learning stages to alleviate the difficulty associated with complex transformation processes. The proposed instructional strategy brings various techniques together to enhance the learning experience. A functional prototype is implemented with Object-Z as the exemplar subject. Both objective and subjective evaluations using the prototype indicate that the proposed CBL system has a statistically significant impact on learning a complex domain. CBL systems include Learner models to provide adaptable support tailored to individual learners. Bayesian theory is used in general to manage uncertainty in Learner models. In this research, a fuzzy logic based locally <b>intelligent</b> <b>Learner</b> model is utilized. The fuzzy model is simple to design and implement, and easy to understand and explain, as well as efficient. Bayesian theory is used to complement the fuzzy model. Evaluation shows that {{the accuracy of the}} proposed Learner model is statistically significant. Further, opening Learner model reduces uncertainty, and the fuzzy rules are simple and resemble human reasoning processes. Therefore, it is argued that opening a fuzzy Learner model is both easy and effective. Scaffolding requires formative assessments. In this research, a confidence based multiple test marking scheme is proposed as traditional schemes are not suitable for measuring partial knowledge. Subjective evaluation confirms that the proposed schema is effective. Finally, a step-by-step methodology to transform simple UML class diagrams to Object-Z schemas is designed in order to implement problem transformation. This methodology could be extended to implement a semi-automated translation system for UML to Object Models...|$|R

Two fundamentally different approaches for interfaces can be distinguished: conversational methapor and direct manipulation metaphor.

In combining the dichotomy small and large distance with the conversational and direct manipulation dichotomy, four different interface types result. These 4 types {{can be applied to}} both the input and the output side of the interaction. Combining these yields a (4 × 4) 16 cell ‘space of interaction’ matrix.

We will distinguish three generic entities in the interface for instructional simulations: the model entity, the learning entity and the control entity. The model entity is further subdivided into an output and an input aspect, respectively covering the domain model and learner activity. The learning entity consists of an instructional aspect and a learning process aspect. The first one is related to instructional goals and the latter comprises everything that is related to the learning process of the learner. The control entity is mainly for high level control of the simulation environment, giving the learner the opportunity to quit, save and sequence. All aspects of simulation learning environments have to be integrated on one screen. An attempt is made to define generic action and object classes which can be used for this ordering of input and output. Finally, we will give a brief summary of desirable hardware properties...|$|R

A mixed qualitative and quantitative research method {{was used in this}} research. The study evaluated how the interactivity and not how either the lesson or the WebCT function. The conceptual framework focused on interactivity, features of communication tools that promote interactivity, as well as the domains such as cognition, motivation and <b>learner</b> <b>interface</b> as aspects that influence {{the use of}} communication tools. Various web-based tools were used by a sample consisting of a selected small group of IT students who participated in the study. Those communication tools were used to facilitate learning in WebCT. The results showed a total of 145 interactions for the duration of ten sessions. The WebCT communication tools supported either synchronous or asynchronous communication. Communication tools were used to retrieve information and send text-based messages to lecturers and students. Interaction at different levels was evident between student and student, student and lecturer, lecturer and student, lecturer and lecturer, as well as, student and content. In addition to the WebCT communication tools, students used extra web-based communication tools, to facilitate their learning. It was concluded that with continuous advances in information and communication technology and with ever increasing student numbers at resident universities, more tertiary institutions should offer on-line courses. More communication tools should be considered on WebCT to facilitate more interactive learning. Dissertation (MEd (Curriculum Studies)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

6000|$|Mathematics, {{perhaps more}} {{even than the}} study of Greece and Rome, has {{suffered}} from this oblivion of its due place in civilisation. Although tradition has decreed that the great bulk of educated men shall know at least {{the elements of the}} subject, the reasons for which the tradition arose are forgotten, buried beneath a great rubbish-heap of pedantries and trivialities. To those who inquire as to the purpose of mathematics, the usual answer will be that it facilitates the making of machines, the travelling from place to place, and the victory over foreign nations, whether in war or commerce. If it be objected that these ends--all of which are of doubtful value--are not furthered by the merely elementary study imposed upon those who do not become expert mathematicians, the reply, it is true, will probably be that mathematics trains the reasoning faculties. Yet the very men who make this reply are, for the most part, unwilling to abandon the teaching of definite fallacies, known to be such, and instinctively rejected by the unsophisticated mind of every <b>intelligent</b> <b>learner.</b> And the reasoning faculty itself is generally conceived, by those who urge its cultivation, as merely a means for the avoidance of pitfalls and a help in the discovery of rules for the guidance of practical life. All these are undeniably important achievements to the credit of mathematics; yet it is none of these that entitles mathematics to a place in every liberal education. Plato, we know, regarded the contemplation of mathematical truths as worthy of the Deity; and Plato realised, more perhaps than any other single man, what those elements are in human life which merit a place in heaven. There is in mathematics, he says, [...] "something which is necessary and cannot be set aside ... and, if I mistake not, of divine necessity; for as to the human necessities of which the Many talk in this connection, nothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the words. Cleinias. And what are these necessities of knowledge, Stranger, which are divine and not human? Athenian. Those things without some use or knowledge of which a man cannot become a God to the world, nor a spirit, nor yet a hero, nor able earnestly to think and care for man" [...] (Laws, p. 818).[10] Such was Plato's judgment of mathematics; but the mathematicians do not read Plato, while those who read him know no mathematics, and regard his opinion upon this question as merely a curious aberration.|$|R
