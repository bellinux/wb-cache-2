After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then forensic examination proceeds along with the <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that can be used to}} identify and document the injuries. Such evidence-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the caregivers of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff. At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced social support staff are made available to the patient and family.|$|E
25|$|The magistrate, {{as in the}} inquisitorial {{system of}} {{continental}} European law, was both prosecutor and judge. He decided which cases to accept, directed the <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and witnesses,then conducted the trial, {{including the use of}} torture. The magistrate was the sole judge of guilt or innocence and determined the punishment or compensation. Still, his decisions could be reviewed by higher officials, even up to the emperor in capital cases. Since he could be reprimanded for not investigating thoroughly, for not following correct procedure, or even for writing the wrong character, magistrates in later dynasties hired specialized clerks or secretaries who had expertise in the law and bureaucratic requirements.|$|E

[...] A recall with the internal date of February 15, 1694, summoned Phips back to London to answer the charges. It took months for the letter to reach Boston. On July 4, 1694, Phips received the summons to appear before the Lords of Trade. Stoughton, of all people, was ordered to oversee the <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for the hearing, a galling reversal of fortunes for Phips.

60|$|Again {{condemned}} {{to wait in}} inactivity, Randolph tried to resist a certain uneasiness that was creeping over him, by attributing the captain's absence to some unexpected legal consultation or the <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> his prolonged detention being due to the same fog that had delayed his own train. But he was somewhat {{surprised to find that}} the captain had ordered his luggage into the porter's care in the hall below before leaving, and that nothing remained in his room but a few toilet articles and the fateful portmanteau. The hours passed slowly. Owing to that perpetual twilight in which he had passed the day, there seemed no perceptible flight of time, and at eleven o'clock, the captain not arriving, he determined to wait in the latter's room so as to be sure not to miss him. Twelve o'clock boomed from an adjacent invisible steeple, but still he came not. Overcome by the fatigue and excitement of the day, Randolph concluded to lie down in his clothes on the captain's bed, not without a superstitious and uncomfortable recollection of that night, about a year before, when he had awaited him vainly at the San Francisco hotel. Even the fateful portmanteau was there to assist his gloomy fancy. Nevertheless, with the boom of one o'clock in his drowsy ears as his last coherent recollection, he sank into a dreamless sleep.|$|E

40|$|Reputation {{systems support}} trust {{formation}} in artificial societies by {{keeping track of}} the behavior of autonomous entities. In the absence of any commonly trusted entity, the reputation system has to be distributed to the autonomous entities themselves. They may cooperate by issuing recommendations of other entities' trustworthiness. At the time being, distributed reputation systems rely on plausibility for assessing the truthfulness and consistency of such recommendations. In this paper, we point out the limitations of such plausibility considerations and present an alternative concept that is based on evidences. The concept combines the strengths of non-repudiability and distributed reputation systems. We analyze the issues that are related to the issuance and <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidences.</b> In this regard, we identify four patterns of how evidence-awareness overcomes the limitations of plausibility considerations...|$|R

40|$|The {{work of the}} Jisc Managing Research Data {{programme}} is – {{along with}} the rest of the UK higher education sector – taking place in an environment of increasing pressure on research funding. In order to justify the investment made by Jisc in this activity – and to help make the case more widely for the value of investing time and money in research data management – individual projects and the programme as a whole must be able to clearly express the resultant benefits to the host institutions and to the broader sector. This paper describes a structured approach to the measurement and description of benefits provided by the work of these projects for the benefit of funders, institutions and researchers. We outline the context of the programme and its work; discuss the drivers and challenges <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> benefits; specify benefits as distinct from aims and outputs; present emerging findings and the types of metrics and other evidence which projects have provided; explain the value <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>evidence</b> in a structured way to demonstrate benefits generated by work in this field; and share lessons learned from progress to date...|$|R
