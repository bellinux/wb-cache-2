40|$|The Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England {{has been}} used to show, for the first time, that {{picosecond}} laser generated non-thermal K-alpha radiation can be used effectively as a backlighter for radiographic imaging of an implosion. This novel method of x-ray radiography features high temporal resolution, high signal to noise ratio and monochromatic imaging. We present here the Ti K-alpha backlit images of a series of six-beam driven spherical implosions of thin-walled 500 micron Cu doped CD shells. These images, separated by ∼ 0. 5 ns intervals, capture various states of implosion in and around a stagnation time observed to be ∼ 3. 25 ns. Images of imploding coned Cu doped CD shells used in fast ignition research are additionally presented. These images, taken near the previously determined stagnation time, show an imploded core collapsed around an attached <b>gold</b> <b>laser</b> entry cone. These radiographic results were linked to a study of fast electron transport within imploded Cu doped coned CD shells as a result of interaction with a high intensity, short pulse laser. The radiographic results, then, served as a verification of a smooth and uniform implosion and provided an empirical determination of stagnation time, both prerequisites for the electron transport diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Laser based {{transfection}} {{methods have}} proven to be an efficient and gentle alternative to established molecule delivery methods like lipofection or electroporation. Among the <b>laser</b> based methods, <b>gold</b> nanoparticle mediated <b>laser</b> transfection bears the major advantage of high throughput and easy usability. This approach uses plasmon resonances on gold nanoparticles unspecifically attached to the cell membrane to evoke transient and spatially defined cell membrane permeabilization. In this study, we explore the parameter regime for <b>gold</b> nanoparticle mediated <b>laser</b> transfection for the delivery of molecules into cell lines and prove its suitability for siRNA mediated gene knock down. The developed setup allows easy usage and safe laser operation in a normal lab environment. We applied a 532 nm Nd:YAG microchip laser emitting 850 ps pulses at a repetition rate of 20. 25 kHz. Scanning velocities of the laser spot over the sample of up to 200 mm/s were tested without a decline in perforation efficiency. This velocity leads to a process speed of ∼ 8 s per well of a 96 well plate. The optimal particle density was determined to be ∼ 6 particles per cell using environmental scanning electron microscopy. Applying the optimized parameters transfection efficiencies of 88 % were achieved in canine pleomorphic adenoma ZMTH 3 cells using a fluorescent labeled siRNA while maintaining a high cell viability of > 90 %. Gene knock down of d 2 -EGFP was demonstrated and validated by fluorescence repression and western blot analysis. On basis of our findings and established mathematical models we suppose a mixed transfection mechanism consisting of thermal and multiphoton near field effects.

40|$|We {{describe}} a facile approach for nanopatterning of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes over macroscopic areas, and use optical spectroscopy to demonstrate retention of native properties by both site-specifically and non-specifically attached photosynthetic membrane proteins. A Lloyd's mirror dual-beam interferometer {{was used to}} expose self-assembled monolayers of amine-terminated alkylthiolates on <b>gold</b> to <b>laser</b> irradiation. Following exposure, photo-oxidized adsorbates were replaced by oligo(ethylene glycol) terminated thiols, and the remaining intact amine-functionalized regions were used for attachment of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll–protein complex from plants, LHCII. These amine patterns could be derivatized with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), so that polyhistidine-tagged bacteriochlorophyll–protein complexes from phototrophic bacteria could be attached with a defined surface orientation. By varying parameters such as the angle between the interfering beams and the laser irradiation dose, {{it was possible to}} vary the period and widths of NTA and amine-functionalized lines on the surfaces; periods varied from 1200 to 240 nm and linewidths as small as 60 nm (λ/ 4) were achieved.

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} strong spectral {{dependence of}} the efficiency of fluorescence quenching in molecular systems composed of organic dyes and gold nanoparticles. In order to probe the coupling with metallic nanoparticles we use dyes with varied spectral overlap between the plasmon resonance and their absorption. Hybrid molecular structures were obtained via conjugation of metallic nanoparticles with the dyes using biotin-streptavidin linkage. For dyes featuring absorption above the plasmon excitation in <b>gold</b> nanoparticles, <b>laser</b> excitation induces minute changes in the fluorescence intensity and its lifetime for both conjugated and non-conjugated mixtures, which are the reference. In contrast, when the absorption of the dye overlaps with the plasmon resonance, the effect is quite dramatic, reaching 85 % and 95 % fluorescence quenching for non-conjugated and conjugated mixtures, respectively. The degree of fluorescence quenching strongly depends upon the concentration of metallic nanoparticles. Importantly, {{the origin of the}} fluorescence quenching is different {{in the case of the}} conjugated mixture, as evidenced by time-resolved fluorescence. For conjugated mixtures of dyes resonant with plasmon, excitation features two-exponential decay. This is in contrast to the single exponential decay measured for the off-resonant configuration...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the sulphide mineral flotation collector, diisobutyldithiophosphinate (DIBDTPI), with silver, copper, and gold surfaces has been investigated by voltammetry and Raman scattering spectroscopy. Voltammetry showed that DIBDTPI is oxidised to its disulphide on gold whereas the metal-collector compounds are formed on silver and copper. Surface enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) were observed for silver {{in the presence of}} DIBDTPI over a wide potential range and demonstrated that charge transfer chemisorption of the collector takes place. At high potentials, Raman spectra from AgDIBDTPI were also detected. No SERS spectra were evident with copper electrodes, but the formation of CuDIBDTPI was confirmed from Raman spectra. Similar results were observed with diethyldithiophosphate on copper, and this indicates that copper metal does not behave {{in the same manner as}} copper sulphide minerals with regard to interaction with thiophosphate collectors. At high potentials on gold, Raman spectra were observed from the disulphide and AuDIBDTPI. SERS spectra were also found on <b>gold</b> under <b>laser</b> illumination that were characteristic of the development of layer of sulfur and this is explained in terms of photolysis of DIBDTPI radicals formed as intermediates in the oxidation of DIBDTPI to its disulphide.

40|$|Laser based cell {{manipulation}} {{has proven}} to be a versatile tool in biomedical applications. In this context, combining weakly focused laser pulses and nanostructures, e. g. gold nanoparticles, promises to be useful for high throughput cell manipulation, such as transfection and photothermal therapy. Interactions between <b>laser</b> pulses and <b>gold</b> nanoparticles are well understood. However, it is still necessary to study cell behavior in <b>gold</b> nanoparticle mediated <b>laser</b> manipulation. While parameters like cell viability or perforation efficiency are commonly addressed, the influence of the manipulation process on other essential cell parameters is not sufficiently investigated yet. Thus, we set out to study four relevant cell properties: cell volume and area, ion exchange and cytoskeleton structure after <b>gold</b> nanoparticle based <b>laser</b> manipulation. For this, we designed a multimodal imaging and manipulation setup. 200 nm gold nanoparticles were attached unspecifically to canine cells and irradiated by weakly focused 850 ps laser pulses. Volume and area change in the first minute post laser manipulation was monitored using digital holography. Calcium imaging and cells expressing a marker for filamentous actin (F-actin) served to analyze the ion exchange and the cytoskeleton, respectively. High radiant exposures led to cells exhibiting a tendency to shrink in volume and area, possibly due to outflow of cytoplasm. An intracellular raise in calcium was observed and accompanied by an intercellular calcium wave. This multimodal approach enabled for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the cell behavior in gold nanoparticle mediated cell manipulation. Additionally, this work can pave the way for a better understanding and the evaluation of new applications in the context of cell transfection or photothermal therapy...|$|R
