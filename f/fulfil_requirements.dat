50|$|After the war the Royal Air Force {{used the}} {{airfield}} primarily in a supply role for British troops. From 1922 Instone Air Line provided a first regular passenger service to London via Brussels. The airfield {{was returned to}} the city of Cologne in 1925 and the civil airport was officially opened one year later. In order to <b>fulfil</b> <b>requirements</b> of modern aircraft adjacent property was bought. The enlarged airfield had a circular shape and occupied around 30 hectares. Than mayor of Cologne Konrad Adenauer supported the development of Butzweilerhof into a modern airport, but due to limited financial resources only small progress was made during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Some facilities in use still originated from the imperial air station, while newer ones were basic and partially made of wood.|$|E
5000|$|The TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, {{high-speed}} train) is France's {{high-speed rail}} service. The {{idea of a}} high-speed train in France was born about twenty years before the first TGVs entered service. At that time, about 1960, a radical new concept was thought up; combining very high speeds and steep grades would allow a railway to follow the contours of existing terrain, like a gentle roller coaster. Instead {{of one or two}} percent grades which would be considered steep in normal applications, grades up to four percent would be feasible, thus allowing more flexible (and cheaper) routing of new lines. Over the next several years, this very general idea gave rise to a variety of high speed transportation concepts, which tended to move away from conventional [...] "wheel on rail" [...] vehicles. Indeed, the French government at the time favoured more [...] "modern" [...] air-cushioned or maglev trains, such as Bertin's Aérotrain; Steel wheel on rail was considered a dead-end technology. Simultaneously, SNCF (the French national railways) was trying to raise the speeds of conventional trains into the range 180 to 200 km/h (110 to 125 mph) for non-electrified sections, by using gas turbines for propulsion. Energy was reasonably cheap in those years, and gas turbines (originally designed for helicopters) were a compact and efficient way to <b>fulfil</b> <b>requirements</b> for more power. Following on the TGS prototype in 1967, SNCF introduced gas turbine propulsion with the ETG (Elément à Turbine à Gaz, or Gas Turbine Unit) turbotrains in Paris - Cherbourg service, in March 1970.|$|E
