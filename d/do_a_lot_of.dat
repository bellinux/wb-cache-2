5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

25|$|For many engineers, {{technical}} work {{accounts for}} {{only a fraction of}} the work they <b>do.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.|$|E
25|$|These techniques, {{although}} {{they take a}} long time, involve very little operator intervention and thus are very cheap. Small tumblers (one pound capacity) are available and inexpensive for home/hobbyist use. At {{the other end of}} the scale, professionals can use very large barrels to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work at once. The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E
25|$|The Loire Valley has a {{long history}} of {{winemaking}} dating back to the 1st century. In the High Middle Ages, the wines of the Loire Valley were the most esteemed wines in England and France, even more prized than those from Bordeaux. Archaeological evidence suggest that the Romans planted the first vineyards in the Loire Valley during their settlement of Gaul in the 1st century AD. By the 5th century, the flourishing viticulture of the area was noted in a publication by the poet Sidonius Apollinaris. In his work History of the Franks, Bishop Gregory of Tours wrote of the frequent plundering by the Bretons of the area's wine stocks. By the 11th century the wines of Sancerre had a reputation across Europe for their high quality.

[...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen.

Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, {{or whatever you want}} to call it, that just gave it this great edge."
