50|$|The Marksmen {{were not}} the only club to relocate, merge or disappear. This has made it {{difficult}} to follow the teams as they progressed through this year's competition. To muddy the waters more, the Providence <b>Gold</b> <b>Bugs</b> had been bought by a group of Fall River businessmen and moved to that city to replace the Marksmen. The <b>Gold</b> <b>Bugs</b> were then renamed Fall River F.C. Several records of this Challenge Cup incorrectly refer to the winning team as Fall River F.C., confusing it with the Fall River Marksmen. Furthermore, after the <b>Gold</b> <b>Bugs</b> had moved to Fall River to become Fall River F.C., it merged with the New Bedford Whalers. As these teams had all played initial Challenge Cup games, the results become difficult to follow.|$|R

I bought a claim out of which a man had made a fortune--five or six thousand pounds at least--as I thought, very cheap; that is, I gave him five hundred pounds down for it.
