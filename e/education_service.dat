40|$|International {{trade in}} <b>education</b> <b>services</b> {{belongs to the}} {{category}} of international trade in <b>services,</b> which takes <b>education</b> <b>services</b> as its object.

The education market in China is very large and still lack of development. It means opportunities to foreign suppliers of <b>education</b> <b>services.</b> WTO requires each member nation to make its own schedule of commitments in <b>education</b> <b>services,</b> and to explain its limitations on market access and national treatment {{as well as other}} limitations. Therefore, to understand China’s education market, you must understand China’s commitments in <b>education</b> <b>services</b> upon entry into WTO. This paper explains China’s commitments in <b>education</b> <b>services</b> under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and provides rough pictures about the meaning of China’s commitments to foreign suppliers of <b>education</b> <b>services</b> that are eager to either enter into China’s education market or absorb more Chinese students...|$|R
