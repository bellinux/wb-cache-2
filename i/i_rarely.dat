25|$|Bismarck {{took steps}} to silence or {{restrain}} political opposition, as evidenced by laws restricting {{the freedom of the}} press, and the anti-socialist laws. He waged a culture war (Kulturkampf) against the Catholic Church until he realized the conservatism of the Catholics made them natural allies against the Socialists. His king Wilhelm <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> challenged the Chancellor's decisions; on several occasions, Bismarck obtained his monarch's approval by threatening to resign. However, Wilhelm II intended to govern the country himself, making the ousting of Bismarck one of his first tasks as Kaiser. Bismarck's successors as Chancellor were much less influential, as power was concentrated in the Emperor's hands.|$|E

Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 {{copies of the}} EP, and Malkmus said [...] "I used to sell them for fifty dollars. When I needed money I'd go in and sell a couple {{to the store and}} they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out." [...] Malkmus also said that the pair [...] "probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with." [...] The songs on Slay Tracks found airplay on several college radio stations, including University of Virginia's WTJU and University of California, Berkeley's KALX. Kannberg commented on the EP's unanticipated popularity, saying [...] "It was very surprising to find that people were into [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Charles <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> {{attended}} the Royal Maundy service. [...] Author Brian Robinson, who traced {{the development of}} Royal Maundy, suggests that after the Restoration, his son Charles II attempted to gain popularity by assiduous attendance (and distribution of money) at the service. [...] Charles II even attended during the plague years of 1661 and 1663. [...] His brother and successor, James II performed the ceremony as well. [...] Although there is a record of William III doing so in 1698, most sources state that James {{was the last to}} wash the feet of the poor himself, in 1685. [...] There is no record of any attendance by a monarch at the Royal Maundy ceremony after 1698 until 1932, but pre-1725 records are vague. [...] The Lord High Almoner continued to perform the pedilavium at the Maundy ceremony until 1737. [...] Today, the only traces of the pedilavium at Royal Maundy are the nosegays and the linen towels worn by several of the officials.|$|E
500|$|As public {{attention}} focused on Maulbetsch as [...] "the greatest line-plunger of a decade," [...] the press could not get enough of Maulbetsch, even interviewing his family. [...] His sister revealed that Maulbetsch had a fondness for home cooking and received permission from the team trainer to eat at his family's Ann Arbor home. [...] "Now, Johnny's sister explains that each day his mother baked two pies for the athlete's supper, and that in addition he had everything else his appetite craved, including coffee." [...] Confronted by reporters about the revelation, Maulbetsch replied: [...] "The story was slightly exaggerated. [...] <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> ate more than one and one half pies for dinner." [...] Joking references to Maulbetsch's diet continued when it was reported in 1915 that {{he was suffering from}} [...] "acute indigestion." [...] One reporter quipped, [...] "Those much advertised pies of his maw's evidently aren’t as great training dope as they were cracked up to be." [...] It turned out that the indigestion was appendicitis, and Maulbetsch was hospitalized at St. Joseph's Sanitarium in Ann Arbor in April 1915, where he underwent an operation.|$|E
500|$|Brudvig {{praised the}} {{campaign}} for avoiding the [...] "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" [...] of past Halo titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for The Guardian that Reachs story made previous entries feel [...] "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous Halo titles had become mired in inconsistencies and Star Trek-like technobabble, Reach told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: [...] "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for {{a big chunk of}} the campaign, as <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> saw him." [...] Wireds Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of Aliens, writing that most of the characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as [...] "minor quibbles" [...] compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that Reachs campaign was better than ODSTs, but lacked the [...] "franchise-changing potential" [...] it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, [...] " [...] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".|$|E

In a 2003 interview he stated that [...] "I visit at least one a week, quietly, on my own. It helps to see how people work. How they define themselves. <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> buy from galleries." [...] Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo, and a portrait by Darren Coffield of Massow in full foxhunting attire, which was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, {{to assist them in}} their lives and work.|$|E
2500|$|Late in life, Buñuel {{claimed to}} dislike non-diegetic music (music not {{intrinsic}} {{to the scene}} itself) and avoided its use, stating: [...] "In my last films <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> use music. If I do, {{it has to be}} justified, so the viewer can see its source: a gramophone or a piano." [...] One consistent exception, however, is the use of the traditional drums from his birthplace Calanda, which are heard in most of his films, with such regularity that the repetition {{has been described as a}} [...] "biofilmographic signature". Buñuel's explanation of his use of these drums was the statement: [...] "Nowhere are they beaten with such mysterious power as in Calanda...in recognition of the shadows that covered the earth at the moment Christ died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, <b>I</b> <b>rarely</b> left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
