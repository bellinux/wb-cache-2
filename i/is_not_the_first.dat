5|$|Enterprise soon {{arrives at}} Tarquin's planet. He welcomes Archer and Hoshi and soon agrees {{to work on}} reading the weapon fragment, but only if Sato agrees to remain with him. They agree, and Enterprise departs to {{investigate}} the second sphere. Tarquin and Sato discuss many subjects and initially the alien seems trustworthy. However she also discovers {{that he had been}} watching her telepathically for some time and that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> person to be brought here to provide companionship for him.|$|E
5|$|Instead he used guerrilla filmmaking techniques, which {{sometimes}} call for using locations without getting permission. Escape from Tomorrow <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> film made in whole, or part, this {{way at the}} Disney parks. In 2010, the British street artist Banksy shot a scene for Exit Through the Gift Shop {{in one of the}} parks with his collaborator Mr. Brainwash. They managed to smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a viral found footage short, Missing in the Mansion, filmed in the Haunted Mansion, was distributed online without interference from Disney.|$|E
5|$|The Manasollasa {{contains}} recipes of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines, which {{according to}} Mary Ellen Snodgrass, the editor of Encyclopedia of Kitchen History, preceded the cookbook writing history in Europe by a century. While the text <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> among Indian books to describe fermented foods, it contains a range of cuisines based on fermentation of cereals and flours. Among meat dishes, the text {{does not include the}} meat of cow, horse, elephant, parrot, peacock or eggs. It describes cuisines based on pork, venison, goat meat, and fish among others.|$|E

Many successful startups have pursued copycat business ideas. Facebook <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> social network.

It was constructed directly on top of a late Roman (early Byzantine) basilica which dates to the 5th–6th century AD. The Roman basilica may have remained in use by the local congregation during the First Bulgarian Empire, though it was no longer active by the time the construction of the current church began.|$|E
5|$|Boone offers Bryan $25,000 {{to break}} up with Shannon but Bryan asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that Bryan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to {{him to get the}} money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} {{said that it was}} probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on certain elements of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass is {{rescued by}} a group of elderly people living in a scrap yard. At the hospital, the doctors are shocked when Isabel levitates off her bed and explodes in a cloud of dust. Elsewhere, the devastated Kapp is left alone in the ruins of his cottage and observatory. More and more young people are joining the Planet People, {{including}} the gangs that have been terrorising the cities and the soldiers assigned to keep them away from the Megalithic sites. Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits for this production are fragmentary like many 1910 Thanhouser productions. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The role of Willie Stone was played by Marie Eline. This film was another example of Eline cast in the role of a boy. Eline's with the first such credit was as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland. If the cast information provided by the The Monroe News-Star is accurate, it represents the earliest credit of Mignon Anderson for the Thanhouser Company. If it <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> known credit for would be four months later in Robert Emmet in March 1911. The film would also be an early credit of William Garwood, who was among the most important actors at Thanhouser. He joined the company in late 1909 and remained until 1911 before returning in 1912. His previous and first credited work with Thanhouser was Jane Eyre.|$|E

25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{time that}} the theme of a {{relationship}} between Beowulf and Grendel's mother was explored.

In this story, Beowulf as the narrator is ambiguous about what happened between Grendel's mother and himself.|$|E
