By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the Peace, Columbia, and Nechako River watersheds (the Nechako Diversion to Kemano, was to supply power to the Alcan Inc. aluminum smelter at Kitimat, and {{was not part of the}} provincial power grid but privately owned). Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the Columbia River Treaty between Canada and the United States.

Concern for the environment has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the red-bellied piranha. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the <b>forest</b> <b>sector</b> represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.|$|E

40|$|The limited {{supply of}} high quality {{planting}} materials for a wide species base is {{a major reason for}} the limited success of reforestation programmes or projects in many developing countries. This paper reports the research that was undertaken to improve the supply {{of high quality}} planting materials for agroforestry, tree farming and reforestation in the Philippines. A systems approach was used to identify mechanisms to improve the operational effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector.</b> A Bayesian Belief Network of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector</b> was developed to examine the interactions between the key components of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector,</b> identify key leverage points for intervention and explore potential impacts of possible policy interventions. Although improving the operational effectiveness of individual, communal and government nurseries will result in high operational effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector,</b> the operational effectiveness of government nurseries is likely to {{have a negative impact on}} the market for seedlings from smallholder nurseries i. e. individual and communal nurseries, thus impeding the sustainability of smallholder nurseries. Increasing the supply of high quality germplasm for a wide variety of species, improving the technical capabilities of smallholder nursery operators in seedling production and increasing the market demand of high quality seedlings from smallholder nurseries are the most important requirements for improving the operational effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector.</b> However, government nurseries can play a crucial role in improving the effectiveness of the <b>forest</b> nursery <b>sector</b> by diversifying their production to focus on species that are in demand by smallholder farmers and which cannot be supplied by individual or communal nurseries.

In reaction, global society is moving toward coordinated action to reduce manmade greenhouse gas emissions in an effect to avoid possible future adverse effects. Under such an effort, high cost strategies {{may be required to}} deal with near term fossil fuel consumption until new technological developments reduce fossil fuel dependency or increase energy utilization efficiency. However, carbon sequestration in the agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> may serve as an important bridge to the future helping to hold costs down until technology develops. We examine the dynamic role of carbon sequestration in the agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> can play in mitigation. A 100 year mathematical programming model, depicting U. S. agricultural and forest sectoral activities including land transfers and greenhouse gas consequences is applied to simulate potential mitigation response. The results reveal that carbon sequestration is a very important mitigation strategy that can be implemented in the early decades, although policy design must consider that the stored carbon saturates and in turn could be released in the future. climate change mitigation; agriculture and forestry; carbon sequestration; saturation...|$|R

40|$|Global {{society is}} moving towards action to reduce {{anthropogenic}} greenhouse gas emissions. This {{can be expensive}} and socially disruptive in countries like the United States where {{the vast majority of}} emissions arise from electrical energy generation and petroleum usage. Agricultural and forest carbon sequestration along with development of other greenhouse gas offsets may help hold costs and disruption down. However sequestration exhibits saturation and non permanence that may influence this role. We examine the dynamic role that the agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> can play in emissions offsets and mitigation. A 100 year modeling analysis, depicting U. S. agricultural and forest sectoral activities is applied to simulate agricultural and forestry potential mitigation response. The results reveal that agriculture and forestry can play an important role principally through cropland soil sequestration, afforestation and biofuel provision. However the importance of these strategies varies with price and time. At low carbon prices and in the near term agricultural soils are most important in the longer term and at high prices powerplant feedstock biofuels dominate. Ignoring saturation leads to an overstatement of the potential importance of sequestration strategies. Nevertheless the results show that the agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> may serve as an important bridge to the future helping to hold costs down until energy emissions related technology develops. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> in {{many regions}} and {{countries}} are facing a need to change their structure, due {{to the development of}} new markets, emergence of new competitors, and shifts in production and consumption patterns for forest products. This article focuses on recent changes in the trade in these products, on imports and exports of four countries (USA, Sweden, Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, China) during the period from 1995 to 2011. For this purpose we use explanatory data analysis, time series analysis, benchmarking, meta-synthesis and content analysis of scientific and business publications concerning national and global trends in forest product industries. Data sources are various organizations’ databases of international trade in forest-based products in both monetary and physical terms (cubic meters and tons). The results show that the US and Swedish <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> are adversely affected by downturns in both their domestic and foreign markets during the study period, while the Ukrainian sector maintains exports of low value-added products at roughly constant levels (except that particle-board exports increase). China maintains production quantities of low value-added forest-based products, but also substantially increases exports of high-value added products. The results may facilitate efforts to forecast future trends and provide useful information and methodological approaches for future studies of interest to industry representatives, policy-makers and researchers...|$|R

However, uncertainties remain as to how the agriculture and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> might jointly respond to increased demand for bioelectricity feedstocks and the potential environmental consequences of increased biomass production. We use an economic model to examine how the agriculture and <b>forest</b> <b>sectors</b> might combine to respond to increased demands for bioelectricity under simulated future nationallevel renewable electricity standards. Both sectors are projected to contribute biomass, although energy crops, like switchgrass, produced on agriculture land are projected to be the primary feedstocks. At the highest targets for bioelectricity production, we project increased conversion of forest to agriculture land in support of agriculture biomass production. Although land conversion takes place in response to renewable electricity mandates, we project only minor increases in forest and agriculture emissions. Similarly, crop prices were projected to generally be stable in the face of increased bioelectricity demand and displacement of traditional agriculture crops. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
