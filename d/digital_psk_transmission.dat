40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a time-domain {{receiver}} design scheme for {{high data rate}} single carrier multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) underwater acoustic communications. In this scheme, each received packet is artificially partitioned into blocks for processing. The MIMO channel is initially estimated using training blocks {{at the front of}} transmitted packets from all transducers. With the estimated MIMO channel, one data block following the training blocks is equalized. The phase rotation in the equalized data block is compensated by a group-wise phase correction operation, before symbol detection. The newly detected data block along with K − 1 previous data (or pilot) blocks are utilized to re-estimate the channel, which is employed to equalize the next new data block. The block-wise processing procedure is repeated until all blocks in the received packet are processed and demodulated. The proposed receiver scheme is tested with MakaiEx 05 experimental data measured at Kauai, Hawaii, in September 2005. Processing results show that it works effectively with 2 × 8 BPSK, QPSK and 8 <b>PSK</b> <b>transmissions</b> at the symbol period of 0. 1 milliseconds. The average uncoded bit error rate (BER) is on the order of 8 × 10 − 4 for BPSK, 3 × 10 − 2 for QPSK, and 8 × 10 − 2 for 8 <b>PSK</b> <b>transmission.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic concept}} of three-level delta {{modulation}} (TLDM) is to quantize the error signal of a delta modulator into three levels {{instead of the}} usual two levels as in ordinary DM. A TLDM system must be able to transmit three different signals, corresponding to three possible states of the quantizer, whereas the ordinary DM system has to transmit only two signals. The problem of transmitting these signals over a noisy channel is examined, where the input signal is band-limited Gaussian noise. Two parameters that can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the system with respect to quantizing noise are considered: step size and quantizer threshold setting. The effect of additive channel noise on the performance of a TLDM system is assessed in terms of baseband transmission, probability of error, FSK and <b>PSK</b> <b>transmission,</b> transmission bandwidth, and baseband pulse transmission. It is concluded that TLDM can provide a 5 to 6 dB improvement in quantizing signal to noise ratio over ordinary DM for band-limited Gaussian signals.

40|$|Abstract — Novel blind channel estimators {{based on}} the finite {{alphabet}} property of information symbols are derived in this paper for OFDM and related multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems. The resulting algorithms are applicable not only to standard OFDM transmitters with cyclic prefix, {{but also to the}} recently proposed zero padded OFDM transmissions that improve symbol recovery at the expense of altering the transmitter and complicating the equalizer. Based on FFT-processed received data, channel identifiability is guaranteed regardless of channel zero locations and various channel estimation algorithms become available by trading off complexity with performance. Unlike existing blind channel estimators, the proposed alternatives require short data records especially for <b>PSK</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The inherent scalar ambiguity is easily resolved because it has unit amplitude and phase values drawn from a finite set. Decoupling channel from symbol estimation enables a phase-directed operation that improves upon decision-directed schemes that are known to suffer from error propagation.
