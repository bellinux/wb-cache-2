40|$|The present {{writing is}} based on the ongoing study {{entitled}} "university environmental Life. A construction based on daily life imaginaries", registered in the Vice—rectory or Research and Postgrades of the Universidad de Caldas in October 2006, which attempts to understand <b>imaginaries</b> constructed regarding the environment within the clatter of daily college life. A first approach to environmental <b>imaginaries</b> at the Universidad de Caldas was carried out using institutional documentary sources such as the Institutional Educative Project, Luna Azul Journal and research catalogues, permitting to sail through the general senses drawn by the <b>imaginaries</b> irradiated within the institutional perimeter. In this revision, instituted <b>imaginaries</b> include environmental protection, the identification of the people responsible for environmental problems, the characterization of nature (animated and unanimated) and environmental education. Instituting <b>imaginaries</b> include: alternate education forms, which is to say, different from traditional styles, interdependent relationship between humans and nature, imagination as a change, transformation and construction potent for the future. A second approach involves the flow of environmental <b>imaginaries</b> from university daily life. The results show a strong configuration of instituted <b>imaginaries</b> from the conception of seeing the environment as nature (generally flora and fauna), a second configuration of instituting <b>imaginaries</b> was drawn from social aspects oriented towards culture; and a third configuration based on radical <b>imaginaries,</b> connected to the notion of magma, surroundings (everything what surrounds us) and technology...|$|R
30|$|Although {{all these}} {{cultural}} <b>imaginaries</b> are well known, the more specific sociotechnical <b>imaginaries</b> {{of the films}} allude to the dominant critical mentality of our age. Nevertheless, the analyses demonstrate that such <b>imaginaries</b> are expressed in films, thus making films a source through which one can inquire into <b>imaginaries</b> of future technoscientific worlds. In contrast to science-based science and technology assessments, films allow a visualization of cultural imaginations with regard to ways that technoscience may shape our world in the future, thus providing access to a heuristic understanding of such futures.|$|R

5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an <b>imaginary</b> setting.

Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of urban <b>imaginaries</b> in filmic and photographic portrayals {{of the financial crisis}} of 2008.

In particular, the article analyses <b>imaginaries</b> of architectural geometries, skyscraper aesthetics and corporate glass facades in popular crisis visualizations. The article concludes by questioning the political implications of these forms of crisis portrayal. It proposes to read urban <b>imaginaries</b> in crisis portrayals as symptoms of a crisis in contemporary economic thought and cultural/media representation. Therefore, urban <b>imaginaries</b> can be taken as points of departure for a critical discourse analysis of financial crisis media coverage...|$|R

40|$|As {{the myth}} of the Eldorado evokes, {{international}} migration is partly shaped by the perceptions and <b>imaginaries</b> of migrants themselves. Beyond such cliché, however, there is little knowledge regarding the nature and influence of myths and <b>imaginaries</b> on migration dynamics. As symbolic collective representations of individuals’ aspirations, hopes and dreams, myths and <b>imaginaries</b> constitute an important part of migrants’ experiences and have concrete implications for the study of migration. This policy brief examines how migrants’ myths and <b>imaginaries</b> influence the relationship between migration policies and migration movements. This policy brief focuses on four myths and <b>imaginaries</b> that, after close analysis, shed new light on the dynamic interactions between migration policies and migration patterns. We have identified four myths based on discussions held among researchers and practitioners during a one-day symposium that we organized at the University of Ottawa in May 2014 : (1) {{the myth of}} the “migrant-as-hero”; (2) the myth of freedom of geographical mobility; (3) the myths and <b>imaginaries</b> related to (im) migration categories; and (4) the myths and <b>imaginaries</b> related to the country of destination as a country of human rights and better life. Based on a detailed analysis of these four myths, this policy brief reveals how myths and <b>imaginaries</b> intervene as an additional element in the relationships between migration policies and migrants’ projects and strategies, and thus serves to move beyond simplified “dual” interactions between policies and migratory movements. We advance three policy-relevant recommendations: (1) more research is required to document the existence of a diversity of myths and to improve understanding of multiple influences migrants’ myths and <b>imaginaries</b> have on the dynamics between migration policies and migrants’ projects; (2) because they have concrete implications at multiple levels, policy-makers should pay closer attention to migrants’ myths and imaginaries; and (3) policy-making should adopt a more sensible approach to the particular context in which myths and <b>imaginaries</b> are (re) produced.

40|$|In this text, {{the author}} {{attempts}} to clarify {{certain aspects of}} <b>imaginaries</b> {{in relation to the}} State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues {{to be one of the}} structures of <b>imaginaries.</b> <b>Imaginaries,</b> beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on <b>imaginaries,</b> and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to “serve as a screen against fears. ” In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious <b>imaginaries?</b> To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope “in a world inwhich the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} <b>imaginaries</b> {{of political}} decision {{makers of the}} European Union {{in the context of}} the ‘refugee crisis’ and interprets them according to theories of European integration – neofunctionalism and liberal intergovernmentalism.

The aim of the article is to derive prospects for European integration from the <b>imaginaries.</b> We found that the European <b>imaginaries</b> expressed by the largest group of heads of state and government remain blurred without clarification which position is taken on European integration, while the <b>imaginaries</b> expressed by the Commissioners are mainly characterised by support of further integration. Our interpretation of the European <b>imaginaries</b> suggests that the prospects for further integration remain limited according to neofunctionalism, but are higher following liberal intergovernmentalism.
