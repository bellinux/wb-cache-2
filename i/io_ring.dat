40|$|Emerging "bandwidth hungry" {{applications}} such as high definition video distribution and ultra fast multimedia side-loading have extended the need for multi-gigabit wireless solutions {{beyond the reach of}} conventional WLAN technology or even more recently emerging UWB and MIMO systems. The availability of 7 GHz of unlicensed bandwidth in the 60 GHz spectrum, represents a unique opportunity to address such data-throughput requirements. The 60 GHz Integrated CMOS digital radio chipset comprises of PHY and MAC layers, RF transceiver, High-Speed Digital Interface and an underlying Serial Communication Fabric. To have a complete communication solution compliant with the latest ECMA- 369, ISO/DIS 13156 and IEEE 802. 15. 3 c standards, we build a million gate digital implementation of MAC and PHY. The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) serves as the bridge between the higher layers in the communication stack (PAL-MAC) and the lower layers like PHY-RF Front End. The MAC module can setup the communication link on the fly by tuning parameters such as operating channel, channel bonding and bandwidth, data rates, error correction mechanisms, handshaking mechanisms, etc, by using the SPI to communicate with internal components. The SPI interface plays a crucial rule in not only this, but also during the testing and debug phase. Operation of each of the RF modules is monitored through the serial interface using local SPI slaves which are hooked up to the 4 -wire serial bus running all through the chip. The SPI host controller emulates an embedded protocol analyzer. For calibration and fine tuning purposes, digital settings can also be loaded onto these modules through the SPI interface. R- 2 R DACs are used to convert these commands into analog voltages which then provide a tunable bias to the RF and mixed-signal modules. Other key functions of this serial communication and control interface are: Initialization of all of the RF and mixed signal modules, DC calibration of data converter, PLL and other mixed-signal modules, data acquisition, parametric tuning for digital modules such as linear equalizer, Gain Control loops (AGC, VGA), etc. Ultra high speed digital Input-Output buffers are used to provide an external data interface to the radio chipset. These high speed I/Os are also used in the gbps (gigabit-per-second) link for data transfer between the RF transceiver chip and the PHY-MAC baseband chip. The IOs are expected to comply with different signaling standards such as LVDS, SLVS 200, SLVS 400, etc. A robust system involves a meticulous pad ring design with proper power domains and power cuts. Full-chip integration of the digital PHY, MAC, peripheral logic and <b>IO</b> <b>ring</b> is done in a semi-custom fashion. M. S.

[...] At Uranus Voyager 2 discovered a substantial magnetic field around the planet and 10 additional moons. Its flyby of Neptune uncovered three complete rings and six hitherto unknown moons as well as a planetary magnetic field and complex, widely distributed auroras. Voyager 2 is still the only spacecraft to have visited the ice giants.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the rings of Uranus are mostly {{immersed}} in the solar wind if Uranus lacks an intrinsic magnetic field. Except for geologically active moons like <b>Io,</b> the <b>rings</b> and moons of Jupiter and Saturn have either high albedos in a low radiation environment or low albedos in a high radiation environment. It is suggested that the moons of Uranus have a significantly lower albedo {{than those in the}} low radiation environment of Saturn, and that the rings of Uranus are black because the rings and moons of that planet are relatively depleted in their surface stores of ices. In this scenario, immersion of the Uranus rings in the solar wind provides a loss mechanism for ring ices. The black rings may thus imply the lack of an intrinsic Uranus magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|THE Ulysses {{spacecraft}} detected {{streams of}} sub-micrometre-sized dust particles as it approached Jupiter in 1992 (1, 2), Although interplanetary space {{was known to}} contain dust, the presence of discrete streams was completely unexpected, The directions from which the dust grains struck the spacecraft strongly suggested that the source lay somewhere within the Jupiter system, Three origins were proposed, the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (ref, 3), Jupiter's gossamer ring(4), and the volcanoes on Io(5), {{but there was no}} definitive evidence for or against any of the options. Here we report the detection by the Galileo spacecraft of even more intense dust streams-including three intense dust storms of month-long duration, with impact rates up to 10 times higher than those observed by Ulysses, Our analysis of the data confirms that the dust streams originate near Jupiter; rye are able to rule out a cometary origin, but cannot yet determine conclusively whether the dust comes from <b>Io</b> or the <b>ring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nonpropagating mirror-mode {{structures}} are commonly observed {{in many regions}} of natural plasma such as solar wind, planetary magnetosheaths, in cometary plasma, <b>Io</b> wake, terrestrial <b>ring</b> current and even {{on the outskirts of}} solar system. Mirror {{structures are}} typically observed in the shape of magnetic holes or peaks. Fast survey mode plasma data from the THEMIS satellites are used to solve the puzzle of how mirror structures in the form of dips can be observed in the regions of mirror stable plasma. THEMIS data also show that for mirror structures with spatial scales that considerably exceed ion Larmor radius the perpendicular temperature anticorrelates with the strength of the magnetic field. This contradiction with the conservation of adiabatic invariants is explained by the role of trapped particles. Citation: Balikhin, M. A., R. Z. Sagdeev, S. N. Walker, O. A. Pokhotelov, D. G.

500|$|The {{discovery}} of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki {{were the first}} sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed {{in one of two}} ways. Io's largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate pyroclastic material with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate pyroclastics) deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at <b>Io,</b> forming red <b>rings</b> more than [...] in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than [...] tall, and are among the most long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io's lithosphere.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Shirai {{traveled}} to Mexico, where she entered a local wrestling school to undergo further training. On October 14, 2010, Shirai, {{working under the}} ring name Biba Kasai, made her debut for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) at an event in Naucalpan, Mexico, where she teamed with Mini Abismo Negro, Monster Clown and Yuriko to defeat El Hijo de Cien Caras, Mari Apache, Mascarita Divina and Pasión Cristal via disqualification in an eight-person tag team match. In Mexico, both Shirais worked under cat-like masks they would only wear for their entrances in Japan. On October 31, both of the Shirai sisters were brought over to AAA, which had a working relationship with IWRG, and repackaged, with <b>Io</b> adopting the <b>ring</b> name Oyuki and Mio becoming Kaguya. In their first AAA match, Oyuki and Kaguya teamed with Yuriko in a six-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Cynthia Moreno, Gato Eveready and Mari Apache. During their stay in AAA, Oyuki and Kaguya became associates of the La Legión Extranjera (Foreign Legion) stable. On November 7, Oyuki and Kaguya defeated Faby and Mari Apache in a tag team match and afterwards stole Faby's AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship and Mari's AAA Reina de Reinas Championship belts. On November 15, the Apaches and Cynthia Moreno defeated Oyuki, Kaguya and Sexy Star in a six-woman tag team match. A week later, Oyuki, Kaguya and Jennifer Blake defeated Moreno and the Apaches in another six woman tag team match. This {{would turn out to}} be Oyuki's and Kaguya's final AAA appearance, which resulted in the storyline with the Apaches being dropped without a conclusion.|$|R
