As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict <b>deflection</b> () <b>of</b> radial-ply <b>tire</b> based on section width (b), overall unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, <b>deflection</b> <b>of</b> four radial-ply <b>tires</b> with different section width and/or overall unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results <b>of</b> <b>deflection</b> measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model.

50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm.

Experimental tire and rim base tests were conducted to understand the <b>deflection</b> characteristics <b>of</b> off-the-road <b>tires</b> and to validate the finite element model of a five-piece wheel/tire (sized 29. 5 - 29) assembly.

A robust tire model was validated with an average accumulative error of 9. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 96 for tire deflections, compared to the experimental tests. The rim base model was validated with an average error of 7. 6 % and an average validation metric of 0. 93 for wheel deformations, and an average accumulative error of 12. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 88 for strains, compared to experimental tests. Based on validated FE model of the five-piece wheel/tire assembly, geometry degradation (material wear out at critical regions) and material degradation (fatigue and corrosion) were studied to estimate their effects on fatigue lives. Two design innovations were proposed to enhance safety and fatigue life of the five-piece wheel. The threaded-connection design reduced the possibility of failure due to the mismatched wheel components. The BS band pull-out simulation revealed that the threaded-connection design was twice as strong as the conventional five-piece design in holding wheel components and the tire together, and the wheel may fail in a safer mode. The fatigue lives of the rim base were two orders of magnitude higher than those of the conventional five-piece wheel. The two-piece wheel design completely removed the possibility of wheel failure due to mismatched wheel components; the fatigue lives were increased by over two orders of magnitude, compared to the conventional five-piece wheel...|$|R
