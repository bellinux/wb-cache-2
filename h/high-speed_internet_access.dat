5|$|The City of Ashland {{moved to}} improve local {{broadband}} Internet access {{in the late}} 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) and building a fiber optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the more profitable <b>high-speed</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>access.</b> In October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.|$|E

Under the programme, 400 railway Stations {{across the country are}} being equipped with Wi-Fi technology. In the 2017 Union Budget of India, POS machines, scanners, fingerprint readers, iris scanners and micro ATMs were exempted from all kinds of custom duties.

25|$|Most {{meteorological}} data was acquired {{all at once}} early in the morning, {{and the rest of}} day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; as well as on visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted weather maps were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as weather watches and warnings, surface weather conditions, convective outlooks, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use <b>high-speed</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>access</b> available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.|$|E
25|$|André Labarrère, mayor from 1971 to 2006, worked {{towards a}} first step of the {{beautification}} of the city. Within its recent mandates, on the outskirts, the university was expanding and the Pau-Pyrénées {{was one of the}} first in France to develop a fibre-optic network, infrastructure offering a very <b>high-speed</b> <b>internet</b> <b>access</b> both to individuals and companies. New facilities were created, including sports, such as the Zénith de Pau}, the Palais des Sports, the Jaï Alaï, and the artificial whitewater arena. The city acquired an important centre of health. The racecourse and the airport (depending on CCI) were renovated. The centre of town also saw significant upheavals with the rehabilitation of the Palais Beaumont and the construction of a new private commercial centre named Centre Bosquet. Pau finally embarked on the pedestrianisation of its centre with the reconfiguration of its bus network, the renovation of the Place Clemenceau, the central square of Pau, and the modernisation of the Palais des Pyrénées, a new shopping centre in the city centre, near to the Place Clemenceau. New underground parking compensated for the removal of 400 parking spaces on the surface; also two underground car parks gained redesigned access. Finally, a media library was created in 2012 in the Les Halles quarter.|$|E
