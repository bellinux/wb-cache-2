To evaluate the intensity of these processes, a watershed in Vaca Brava was chosen, presenting a strong contrast between a high, protected Atlantic forest area and another under intensive agriculture and stock raising exploration.

Initially, a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>survey</b> of the watershed was realized and after divided into themes in relation to the slopes, and in addition, establishing relationships of soil texture and density. According to the obtained results, the topography influenced the texture of soils, since; the amount of samples on the slopes rose, having finer textures, in comparison with footslopes and meadows, where texture thickness predominated, in function of the redistribution of sediments by erosion. The soil density, as was expected, decreasing with the increase of the silt and clay content.

40|$|The paper {{details the}} design {{implications}} of a site strain gauge test carried out on the 6 ft 6 in diameter reactor outlet ducting of a nuclear power station. The test subjected {{a portion of the}} ducting to a horizontal load of 10 ton, and the strain gauge survey was taken on a smooth bend of the ducting which was inherently flexible and did not incorporate the usual bellows units to absorb thermal expansions. Theoretical stresses in the bend of the test portion were calculated under the horizontal load, and comparison made between experimental and theoretical values. At the design stage of the station a detailed analysis was carried out for the complete system under thermal expansions, and this analysis is briefly described. Using the comparison obtained from the test portion, an estimate is made of the probable stress levels that will exist in the complete duct system under reactor operating conditions. During fabrication of the smooth bends a <b>dimensional</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out on a complete component, and the tolerances achieved are discussed and compared with tolerances obtained on the more usual smaller diameter welding elbow. The effect of end restraints on the flexibility of smooth bends is also discussed, and the lack of design information on this aspect is emphasized.

40|$|Discussion of how {{range and}} range-difference data types can make {{possible}} precise three-dimensional measurement of ground station positions {{and the position}} of an artificial signal source, without explicit dependence upon the signal source trajectory. An effective strategy for such measurement is to combine the multilateration approach with a VLBI system using natural radio sources. The VLBI methods would provide a coarse grid of three-dimensional benchmark locations on a regional and global scale. Multilateration stations would then occupy these coarse grid locations and provide a means for highly portable, relatively low-cost units to then densify networks on a regional and local scale. Because a multilateration approach can make use of strong artificial radio sources, it makes possible the use of relatively low-cost, highly mobile stations. Such mobile stations are virtually essential for three <b>dimensional</b> <b>surveying</b> in heavily urbanized areas or in rugged terrain...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a rapid {{development}} in the techniques of the automated image based modelling (IBM), especially in advanced structure-from-motion (SFM) and dense image matching methods, and camera technology. One possibility is to use video imaging to create 3 D reality based models of cultural heritage architectures and monuments. Practically, video imaging {{is much easier to}} apply when compared to still image shooting in IBM techniques because the latter needs a thorough planning and proficiency. However, one is faced with mainly three problems when video image sequences are used for highly detailed modelling and <b>dimensional</b> <b>survey</b> of cultural heritage objects. These problems are: the low resolution of video images, the need to process a large number of short baseline video images and blur effects due to camera shake on a significant number of images. In this research, the feasibility of using video images for efficient 3 D modelling is investigated. A method is developed to find the minimal significant number of video images in terms of object coverage and blur effect. This reduction in video images is convenient to decrease the processing time and to create a reliable textured 3 D model compared with models produced by still imaging. Two experiments for modelling a building and a monument are tested using a video image resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels. Internal and external validations of the produced models are applied to find out the final predicted accuracy and the model level of details.

The Church of Santa Maria of Castrelos, which was built in the early thirteenth century, is located in Vigo Spain. It is a Romanesque style church with a nave and semicircular apse with three gates decorated with rosettes and typically Romanesque geometrical figures. The survey was conducted by the laboratory of Close Range Photogrammetry of Natural Resources Department, Mining School, at University of Vigo – Spain, jointly with the Geomatics Department, Federal University of Parana – Brazil. This work explores the use of laser scanning for the surveying, three-dimensional modeling and documentation of historical monuments but also the generation of quoted plans and cross sections of this Romanesque church in the city of Vigo. The resolution of point clouds used to obtain the models varied according to need. Namely, the point cloud used for three-dimensional model for the general external and internal church was used with an approximate step width of 10 cm, while 5 cm and 1 cm step widths were used for details of geometric figures and rosettes. The results of both the three-dimensional model and the plans and sections are in accordance with the specifications and scales of representation usually used in conventional surveys of historic monuments recommended in the specialized literature in the area. The objective of this study is showing the potential of the use of terrestrial laser scanner in the documentation of historical heritage through achieving the 3 D model by joining external and internal point clouds and the generation of planes and sections of the church of Santa Maria of Castrelos, Vigo...|$|E

Abstract In {{the last decade}} some local communities, by urban plans and codes of practice, {{sensitized}} planners and operators about the necessity to intervene on historical buildings considering the environmental typicalness, recognizable in use of materials, constructive techniques and lexical schemes: it is in an evident dialectic with the Italian academy, strongly reluctant to accept that historical architecture in our cities has to be safeguarded, preserved, repaired, restored, rather study-cases for capricious experimentations. The city of Palermo is an efficacious example, with its historical centre regulated by an Executive Particular Plan (PPE) that privileges the history {{and the maintenance of}} historical building, according to trends that allow also the historical urban tissue reconstruction damaged or cancelled by tragic events. The study recently commissioned by the civic administration follows this idea, and it regards an urban context of great interest and complexity because of its historical-architectural characters: the Cassaro monumental street (today called Corso Vittorio Emanuele). By the sides of this city foundation axis, the actual form of architectural fronts overlaps a complex stratification; the heterogeneity of architectural styles and constructive systems, using often plaster and stucco rather than stone, catches a glimpse of the inextricable formation and evolution of its actual architecture behind every degraded area. We could so punctually recognize medieval urban tissue like in adjacent parts, the rectifications of alignment and the sixteenth-century aggregations, the monumental replanning of some eighteenth-century façades; and also the earthquakes and war events damages, the nineteenth-century completions and interventions with hygiene and decorum intents, especially after the Unity of Italy, when Palermo had to appear like the other cities of the new State. All this conditions had to coexist in a difficult city, where decorum of monumental architectures has been often subdued to comfort and to commerce demands, to the fragmentariness provoked by nobility decadence, to the aggressive and disfigured installations. The study of architectural fronts analyzes about sixty civil buildings along the Vittorio Emanuele main street, and it’s initially founded on a cognitive process that includes historical analysis, geometric and <b>dimensional</b> <b>survey,</b> analysis of material and decay systems. We particularly analyzed both the relationships among decay systems and historical stratifications, both the grammar of architectural façades language.

The proposed designs represent so an application to concrete cases, not abdicating to involve physical and economic urban environment: as example we cite the complexity of those solutions that would respect the historical image of building without depressing the commercial demands of ground floor shops...|$|E

40|$|The {{exhibition}} disseminates {{the research}} results coming forth from a 11 days design-research workshop (25 Ferbuary 2016 - 6 March 2016) {{with an international}} group of master students at Politecnico di Milano. On a site adjacent to the campus of Politecnico di Milano, the following topics have been thoroughly investigated by design: Tactic 1 : The Perspective Hinge The basic tactic of this workshop starts from a critical reflection on the operational methods in the conception of architecture. Through an intensive process of making, this MIAW 2016 Workshop explores new avenues that attempt to break through habitual ways of seeing the conception of architecture as it aims for the generation of new space, and more specifically how this happens through the intensive dialectics between this space and its architectural detail. Alberto Pérez-Gòmez and Louise Pelletier (Pérez-Gòmez and Pelletier 1997) elaborate {{on the impact of}} tools of representation on the conceptual development of architectural space and form. “Writing from inside the discipline of architecture, rather than from the more common extrapolations from the history of painting and philosophy, Alberto Pérez-Gómez and Louise Pelletier focus on the implications of the tool of perspective (and the hegemony of vision) for architectural representation. Their primary thesis is that tools of representation have a direct influence on the conceptual development of projects and generation of forms, and that there are alternatives to the reductive working methods of most contemporary practice … The authors' ultimate aim is to probe the possibilities of the constructed world—that is, architecture—as a poetic translation, rather than prosaic transcription, of its representations” (outtake from the synopsis of the book, provided by the publisher). Rather than starting from tested ‘methods’ widely applied in architecture, that start from the level of urban design with its extensive surveys of cities through the application of the plan (or the map), this workshop experimentally starts from the intimate architectural fragment that is represented as a vertical section. From there, the plan is seen as the derivative of the section, and not the other way round. This is the moment where/when the perspective hinge is at work, the moment when two <b>dimensional</b> <b>survey</b> erects into the three dimensional representation of the imagined space and its beloved material detail. This representation works through the vertical depth of the architectural section as the ultimate instrument of the architect in his process of architectural creation.

Tactic 2 : sequence of perceptions: storyboard In a first design cycle, the students investigate the site through observations from their eye level through making a sequence of perceptions that are consciously made as a serial view of vertical sections. These are made through the method of the storyboard, a method architecture can borrow from cinematography. It includes the conscious framing of views, positioning these views in a sequence, and critically assessing these views and their sequence in order to discover their potential and to define a point of preference in the site (see below). The students make the aforementioned observations from the eye level through serial sketching, making photographs and discussing their observations in small groups. The verticality of the observation is crucial, and the registration through sketching and making photographs happens mainly through the frontal view as section or elevation. Tactic 3 : the fragment as point of (p) reference The point of preference, once defined and situated, subsequently also becomes the point of reference, around which the design process evolves into a new architectural fragment. The architectural fragment is situated between the whole of the architectural body and the architectural detail, hence it is strategically positioned to penetrate into the macro and micro scales of architectural conception. Hence the architectural fragment is the strategic scale from where the full span from techné to poiesis can be investigated. Tactic 4 : the poetics of the technics of architectural detail This MIAW 2016 Workshop methodically is atypical in that it does not apply the traditional funnel design approach that starts from the urban scale and subsequently comes down to the scale of architecture to finally end up in the scale of the architectural detail that has to be ‘technically resolved’ in the end. Rather, the method applied here starts from the acknowledgment of the poetic capacities of the architectural detail. It can be explored and developed through the technical mastery of the architect who is the master builder, capable of seamlessly putting his technical mastery at the service of his/her beloved poetics. Hence, the architect should and can be able to span the full stretch from technics to poetics. Techné and Poiesis coexist in this undividable moment of architectural intensity. Intensity is the key word in architecture, as it is in this MIAW 2016 workshop. status: publishe...|$|E

It optimizes through the change of observations of the network, with increment of observations or if it is the case reduction of these. The concept of reliability of a surveying network is related to the capacity that this has to detect blunders such small as possible. And this can be evaluated through the numbers of redundancies. The sum of the partial redundancies of the observations of a surveying network indicates the degree of freedom of the network. Therefore each added redundant observation increases in a unit the sum of the partial redundancies, independent of the observation. In thi...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{redshift}} space correlation function of galaxy clusters for observational samples constructed in different surveys. We explore correlation amplitudes, pairwise velocity distributions and bias factors. Systematics in cluster identification procedures {{are the main}} source of biased estimates of the correlation amplitude and inferred velocity dispersions. By comparing our results with those of numerical simulations we explore the strong influence on the clustering distortion pattern in redshift space from effects associated with the cluster identification procedure from two <b>dimensional</b> <b>surveys</b> as is the case of Abell and APM clusters. The identification of clusters in X-ray surveys improves this situation, although there are still systematic effects which are probably due to identification of optical sources in the determination of cluster redshifts. These systematics are particularly strong for the most luminous X-ray selected clusters in the Extended Bright Cluster Survey, which exhibits very large anisotropies, comparable to those present in the Abell catalogue. Our results demonstrate that forthcoming large redshift surveys will be extremely important for the construction of new samples of groups and clusters as well as improving the determination of optical and X-ray selected cluster distances, essential for reliable analyses of the large scale structure.

40|$|Abstract: Three <b>dimensional</b> seismic <b>survey</b> {{carried out}} in the western Nankai Accretionary Prism off Muroto succeeded in imaging of clear {{geologic}} structure and detailed distribution of BSR. Topography and geologic structure influence the distribution of BSR in the survey area. Especially, depths of BSRs obviously change along out-of-sequence thrusts. In large thrust zone, BSR in the hanging wall of a large thrust reaches down to the thrust, while the footwall does not have clear BSR. Heat flow values calculated from depth of BSR indicate that more intensive fluid convection occurs toward the toe of the Nankai prism. Heat flow increases seaward in each faults unit bounded by out-of-sequence thrusts, and the heat flow drops down at the out-of-sequence thrusts. The same seaward increase and the drop are duplicated at each fault block cut by minor scale thrust. These features give rise to more speculation related to an interaction between geologic structure, fluid migration, and development of BSR and gas hydrate deposits. 1...|$|R

Our results bear out and further quantify the impression from e. g. counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on large scales as compared to the standard CDM model with Ω h≃ 0. 5. We apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with Ω h as a free parameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting parameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally, we calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This agrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian fluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal no trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior. Comment: 31 pages, plain TeX, 9 figures available upon request. UM AC 93 -...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} {{associated with}} road projects In West Central Florida, including {{the extension of}} interstate highways and municipal roadways, sometimes activates buried karst features, as the vibration from heavy machinery and increased infiltration from the clearing of vegetation adds stress to unstable subsurface features. When surface depressions form or raveled soils are detected by SPT borings, {{it is important to}} evaluate the extent of the subsurface feature to design effective ground stabilization and prevent activation or recurrence of the feature. Ground penetrating radar surveys are rapid but are usually limited in depth to about 15 feet by shallow water tables and the presence of silts and clays. In an effort to model greater depths and cover large areas relatively quickly, Subsurface Evaluations, Inc. (SEI) has developed geophysical techniques to collect three-dimensional resistivity data using a single pole-pole array that covers up to 1. 5 acres and models to depths of 70 to 100 feet depending on site conditions. Two case studies from Tampa, Florida are described. Case 1 : The three <b>dimensional</b> resistivity <b>survey</b> technique was used to evaluate subsidence associated with the construction of new lanes for an expressway when a 5 -foot diameter surface depression formed. A test boring over the depression showed very loose and very soft material from a depth of 13 feet to 2...|$|R
40|$|The Earth Sciences and Resources Institute, University of South Carolina is {{conducting}} a 14 month proof of concept study to determine the location and distribution of subsurface Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) carbon tetrachloride (CCl{sub 4 }) contamination at the 216 -Z- 9 crib, 200 West area, Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford Site, Washington by use of two-dimensional high resolution seismic reflection surveys and borehole geophysical data. The study makes use of recent advances in seismic reflection amplitude versus offset (AVO) technology to directly detect the presence of subsurface DNAPL. The techniques proposed are a noninvasive means towards site characterization and direct free-phase DNAPL detection. This report covers the results of Task 3 and change of scope of Tasks 4 - 6. Task 1 contains site evaluation and seismic modeling studies. The site evaluation consists of identifying and collecting preexisting geological and geophysical information regarding subsurface structure and the presence and quantity of DNAPL. The seismic modeling studies were undertaken to determine the likelihood that an AVO response exists and its probable manifestation. Task 2 is the design and acquisition of 2 -D seismic reflection data designed to image areas of probable high concentration of DNAPL. Task 3 is the processing and interpretation of the 2 -D data. Task 4, 5, and 6 were designing, acquiring, processing, and interpretation of a three <b>dimensional</b> seismic <b>survey</b> (3 D) at the Z- 9 crib area at 200 west area, Hanford...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in solid state green laser technology offers a unique possibility for developing compact, low power instruments for high-resolution underwater 3 D imaging and surveying. The paper reviews {{the principles and}} limitations of underwater imaging and describes two new instrument developments; Spotrange and Spotscan, utilizing the new laser technology for detailed ROV based inspection and surveying. A number of actual field applications are given, including structural inspection, detailed seabed <b>surveying,</b> <b>dimensional</b> control measurements and pipeline free-span measurements. 1. Subsea robotics. The oil price crash of 1986 caused the North Sea oil companies to abandon many of the high cost approaches to field developments and to focus on lower cost alternatives. The key issues in this process are remote control, unmanned platforms, subsea completion and multiphase pumping. Implicit in all these technical developments is an increased need for automated data collection and control systems which does not compromise the safety either for personnel or the marine environment...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the Christian school (K- 12) {{is the development of}} a biblical worldview in its students. This study examined the impact that these Christian schools had on their students’ biblical worldview development by administering a biblical worldview assessment to graduate students at a private, Christian university (Liberty University). Christian, graduate students in the School of Education at Liberty completed a demographic survey and a biblical worldview assessment. The survey collected information on age, gender, type of K- 12 schools attended, profession to the Christian faith, and denominational background. The results of the survey and assessment were analyzed to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} in the biblical worldviews of Christian students who had a substantial Christian school background when compared to Christian students who had a minimal Christian school background and to those who had no Christian school experience. This causal comparative (ex post facto) study employed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post-hoc Tukey test to determine if there were any significant differences between the means of the pre-determined groups and if the null hypotheses should be accepted or rejected. An informational survey was created to capture selected demographic data and the Three <b>Dimensional</b> Worldview <b>Survey</b> – Form C (3 DWS-Form C) was used to assess biblical worldview. Participation by the graduate students was both voluntary and anonymous. Results of the study showed that there was no statistically significant difference in participants’ biblical worldview scores based on their attendance in Christian school. Portions of the study did indicate that there might be a disposition to a stronger propositional biblical worldview for individuals with a significant Christian school background. Further research should explore this disposition with recently graduated participants...|$|R
40|$|Cassini has afforded {{a number}} of unique {{opportunities}} to understand auroral processes at Saturn and to highlight both differences and similarities with auroral physics at both Earth and Jupiter. A number of campaigns were coordinated with the Hubble Space Telescope such that Cassini could provide either ground truth on the impinging solar wind or in situ measurements of magnetospheric conditions leading to qualitative and sometimes quantitative relationships between the solar wind influence on the intensity, the morphology and evolution of the auroras, and magnetospheric dynamics. The Hubble UV images are enhanced by Cassini’s own remote sensing of the auroras. Cassini’s in situ studies of the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere discussed in other chapters of this book provide the context for understanding the primary drivers of Saturn’s auroras {{and the role of}} magnetospheric dynamics in their variations. Finally, Cassini’s three <b>dimensional</b> prime mission <b>survey</b> of the magnetosphere culminates in high inclination orbits placing it at relatively small radial distances while on auroral field lines, providing the first such in situ observations of auroral particles and fields at a planet other than Earth. The new observations have spawned {{a number of}} efforts to model the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere and how such dynamics influence the auroras...|$|R

The 2 – <b>Dimensional</b> electrical resistivity <b>survey</b> method for the subsurface imaging {{was done by}} engaging the Wenner array configuration using PASI Resistivity Meter in the surface measurement. The vertical electrical sounding (VES) was also done using the Schlumberger array configuration to determine the depth to the aquifer layer. The DIPRO software and the WIN-Resist application software {{were used for the}} interpretation of the 2 – D resistivity data and VES data respectively. Both Hydrochemical and Microbial analyses were done to test for the presence of heavy metals and the estimation of Total Aerobic Bacteria (TAB). From the VES results the depth to the aquifer lies around 20. 1 m (60. 33 ft.) of resistivity of 34. 1 Ώ-m and the 2 –D results showed the resistivities as 28. 0 Ώ-m and 47. 0 Ώ-m respectively showing that the study area has groundwater potential. For the hydrochemical analysis on heavy metals, the result lies within World Health Organization (WHO) standard for drinking water.
