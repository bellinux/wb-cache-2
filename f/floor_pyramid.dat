40|$|Has done {{research}} {{about the system}} of purification of sea water into drinking water using solar energy. Utilization of solar energy as power naturally adopts the system of evaporation that occurs in a siklur water. Design and construction of tools created {{in the shape of}} a pyramid so that the absorption of thermal energy from the Sun can be maximum. Methods of work of the system is very simple, namely the souls imprisoned in the air that the pyramid would experience an increase in temperature significantly along with the searing Sun. The temperature of the hot air in the space pyramid is causing sea water which is at the bottom (<b>floor)</b> <b>pyramid</b> will evaporate and stick on the wall side of the inside of the pyramid. With the help of gravity, the water vapour will fall in the form of green ears water down the wall of the pyramid. The water will flow through the channel leading into the shelter is. This water is not already contain salt and pure water is so that it can be consumed directly. The results showed that the pyramid with size 160 cm x 160 cm 3 mm fiberglass-wall capable of producing fresh water as much as 2, 100 mL. These results have been tested in the laboratory with a result salinity = 0, 0 at T = 29, 4 °C; TDS = 11 mg/L, 22. 2 ms/cm conductivity, at T = 29. 3 °C, no taste and no smell...|$|E
50|$|There is no 44th {{floor in}} the {{building}} (see Tetraphobia); the 43rd floor connects directly to the 45th <b>floor.</b> The <b>pyramid</b> shaped crown {{is the equivalent of}} 3 stories high and hence marketed as 83-85 to arrive at a round number. There is no elevator access to floors above 80. The columns and foundation are made of steel since at 85th storey the 21MPa (3,000 psi) Ultimate compressive strength of concrete collapses.|$|R
50|$|Movement is {{achieved}} by jumping, running, sliding down poles, and climbing chains and ladders. Enemies are skulls, snakes, and spiders. A further complication arises in the bottom-most <b>floors</b> of each <b>pyramid,</b> which must be played in total darkness unless a torch is found.|$|R
50|$|A small {{camcorder}} (4 by 6 cm), {{lowered to}} {{the depth of}} 5 m through a 15 cm wide hole in an upper <b>floor</b> of the <b>pyramid</b> in April 2011, revealed murals of nine human figures outlined in black against the blood-red background. There was no sarcophagus, {{it is probable that}} the skeleton lies on the slabs of the floor.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of balcony depth and parapet {{form on the}} acoustical performance of building facades close to roadways have been investigated. Various depths and two inclinations of parapet have been modelled on an 8 <b>floor</b> building. <b>Pyramid</b> ray-tracing simulations and scale model measurements have been carried out. The predicted and measured A-weighted sound pressure level reductions over the balcony back wall and in free field conditions have been compared. The results {{have been used to}} derive empirical equations for predicting protection as a function of geometrical parameters. The protection obtained by various parapet depths ranges between 4 and 8 dB(A), while an additional protection of between 0. 5 and 4 dB(A) can be obtained by inclining the parapets...|$|R
50|$|The {{terraces}} {{are supported}} by decorative granite columns that are arranged along the walls and terraces of the estate. Of these terraces, the lower two were cultivated with vegetables and orchard, divided into blocks flanked by boxwood stools. The upper terrace is occupied by the garden itself and by a terrarium that separates it from the house. It occupies a rectangular terrace surrounded by a wall with tiled <b>floor,</b> decorated <b>pyramids,</b> urns and statuary statues, over the access gates, on the side viewpoints and at the angles, together with the raised beds. Inside the flower beds, are five bowls with water springs, similar to those introduced by Muslims during the 8th century, in the Rocaille style. Among the species in the garden are stands of tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) that were contemporary to the initial plantation.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest {{symbol of}} the park is a glass pyramid located near the eastern entrance. The pyramid has a {{nickname}} [...] "Hidamari", which means [...] "sunny spot" [...] in Japanese. The nickname was given in 2002, which was selected from 2,340 applications. With a floor space of 5,328 m² in total, the <b>pyramid</b> has 3 <b>floors</b> and a roof floor overlooking {{a large part of}} the park. The top floor houses the gallery of Isamu Noguchi, and the miniature model of the park is also located. A restaurant and museum shop are located in the ground <b>floor.</b> The <b>pyramid</b> has an air conditioning system to cool down inside in summer, by using snow stored in the neighbouring storage building during winter. Hidamari is also used as the place for some workshops and meetings in the rooms located in the ground and second floor.|$|R
40|$|Joanita Kant 2 ̆ 7 s Gentle People is an {{excellent}} case study of South Dakota 2 ̆ 7 s Rockport Hutterite Colony. The book includes in-depth description {{and analysis of the}} lifestyle of Rockport Colony residents and covers people of all ages and interests. There are numerous helpful photographs, both contemporary and historical. Members of the Rockport Colony belong to a religious society that has practiced 2 ̆ 2 community of goods 2 ̆ 2 for nearly five centuries. The book not only introduces the reader to the deep-seated beliefs and practices of members, but also provides important sociological analysis supported by helpful figures and maps, including population <b>pyramids,</b> <b>floor</b> plans, and colony branching charts. The Hutterites have indeed created an important alternative and communitarian society, which citizens of the modern world might learn much from, especially in terms of economy of scale and conflict management. Kant gives us a good picture of how different life is in a small community where residents are tied to each other by social, economic, and religious bonds. Her book, however, also contains an abundance of factual errors, which greater attention to secondary sources might have forestalled...|$|R
