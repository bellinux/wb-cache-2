The display shows the plane's instrumentation and cockpit view.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} {{recommended that}} Widerøe update its maps for Brønnøysund, review and improve its landing procedures, improve its internal control procedures {{to ensure that}} pilots follow the airline's flight operation regulations, and introduce the Sterile Cockpit Rule. The commission recommended that the Civil Aviation Administration change the flight paths at Brønnøysund to increase the altitude around Torghatten. Flight 710 was the second of four fatal Widerøe accidents which occurred between 1982 and 1993. In the first accident, Flight 933, a poor cockpit culture had also been discovered, but little was followed up, {{in part because of}} a conspiracy theory which surfaced regarding a collision with a <b>fighter</b> <b>jet.</b> Also in the following two major Widerøe accidents, Flight 893 in 1990 and Flight 744 in 1993, the investigation uncovered operational shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|The media baron Elliot Carver soon {{begins his}} plans to use a stolen encoder {{obtained}} at the bazaar by his henchman, cyberterrorist Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights. Meaconing the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS Devonshire off-course into Chinese-held waters in the South China Sea, where Carver's stealth ship, commanded by Mr. Stamper, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese J-7 <b>fighter</b> <b>jet</b> and killing off the Devonshires survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British Minister of Defence orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.|$|E
5|$|Blood Money is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a <b>fighter</b> <b>jet</b> in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E
50|$|Raiden <b>Fighters</b> <b>Jets</b> level {{structure}} {{is even less}} linear. Progression is governed by how well a player performs in a given level, and each level path gives a different end-game sequence. Players can never play through all levels available in Raiden <b>Fighters</b> <b>Jet</b> in one play session.|$|R
50|$|The later Raiden <b>Fighters</b> <b>Jet</b> - 2000 clone runs on cheaper {{hardware}} and features notoriously inferior sound than the original. A newer single-board version was released for the US market. This version of Raiden <b>Fighters</b> <b>Jet</b> is a stand-alone version {{that has all}} fighters available immediately.|$|R

5|$|The Avengers become divided, both {{over how}} to {{approach}} Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk {{falls to the ground}} after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>fighter</b> <b>jet.</b> Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a <b>fighter</b> <b>jet</b> flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
