In later improvements the well-known cylinder press was employed; the plate was inked mechanically and cleaned off by passing under a sharp blade of steel; and the cloth, instead of being laid on the plate, was passed round the pressure cylinder. The plate was raised into frictional contact with the cylinder and in passing under it transferred its ink to the cloth.|$|E
500|$|In January (1788) Mrs Trimmer and John Marshall {{announced}} a new joint venture, The family magazine; or a repository of religious instruction and rational amusement. It was a monthly periodical [...] "designed to counteract the pernicious tendency of immoral books [...] which have circulated of late years among the inferior classes of people," [...] and usually included one <b>engraved</b> <b>plate.</b> The content consisted of ‘religious tales for Sunday evenings’ and ‘moral tales for weekdays’; advice on the management of infants and on childrearing was given together with a comparative view of other nations to demonstrate that ‘the poor in England possess privileges, and enjoy many comforts, which persons of their rank … in other countries cannot enjoy.’ Descriptions of animals were also included, 'in order to check the practice of cruelty to brute creation.' The final section of the magazine contained 'a selection of Ballads, Songs , both ancient and modern, of a Moral Tendency.' Thus, in both its objects and content, this publication introduced many of the ideas which would later bear fruit in Hannah More’s more ambitious and well-known scheme for Cheap Repository Tracts of 1795.|$|E

6000|$|The {{supposed}} {{site of the}} Black Hole {{is marked}} by an <b>engraved</b> <b>plate.</b> I saw that; and better that than nothing. The Black Hole was a prison--a cell is nearer the right word--eighteen feet square, the dimensions of an ordinary bedchamber; and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengal packed 146 of his English prisoners. There was hardly standing room for them; scarcely a breath of air was to be got; the time was night, the weather sweltering hot. Before the dawn came, the captives were all dead but twenty-three. Mr. Holwell's long account of the awful episode was familiar to the world a hundred years ago, but one seldom sees in print even an extract from it in our day. Among the striking things in it is this. Mr. Holwell, perishing with thirst, kept himself alive by sucking the perspiration from his sleeves. It gives one a vivid idea of the situation. He presently found {{that while he was}} busy drawing life from one of his sleeves a young English gentleman was stealing supplies from the other one. Holwell was an unselfish man, a man of the most generous impulses; he lived and died famous for these fine and rare qualities; yet when he found out what was happening to that unwatched sleeve, he took the precaution to suck that one dry first. The miseries of the Black Hole were able to change even a nature like his. But that young gentleman was one of the twenty-three survivors, and he said it was the stolen perspiration that saved his life. From the middle of Mr. Holwell's narrative I will make a brief excerpt: ...|$|E

50|$|Offset ink is a {{specific}} type of ink used in conjunction with offset printing presses such as those used to produce letterpress or lithography prints. Such ink must be specially formulated to resist other chemicals it will come in contact with on the printing press. It is crucial that offset ink resist water-in-ink emulsification (e.g. repel rather than absorb water). It should also withstand degradation by the fountain solution which covers the non-printing areas of the <b>engraved</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|To make a print, the <b>{{engraved}}</b> <b>plate</b> is inked all over, {{then the}} ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the engraved lines. The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press {{together with a}} sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the engraved lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when drypoint, which gives much shallower lines, is used.|$|E

50|$|Steel {{engraving}} {{is still}} done today, {{but to a}} much lesser extent. Today, most printing is done using computerized stencils instead of a steel plate to transfer ink. An exception is currency, which is still printed using steel dies, since each bill then has a character and feel that {{is very difficult for}} counterfeiters to duplicate. An <b>engraved</b> <b>plate</b> causes the ink to be slightly raised and the paper to be slightly depressed, which produces a different haptic sensation than does paper printed by a stencil ink transfer process.|$|E
50|$|The early autopens used {{a plastic}} matrix of the {{original}} signature which is a channel cut into an <b>engraved</b> <b>plate</b> {{in the shape of}} a wheel. A stylus driven by an electric motor followed the x and y axis of a profile or shape engraved in the plate (which is why it is called a matrix). The stylus is mechanically connected to an arm which can hold almost any common writing instrument, so the favourite pen and ink can be used to suggest authenticity. The Autopen signature is made with even pressure (and indentation in the paper), which is how these machines are distinguishable from original handwriting where the pressure varies.|$|E
50|$|This {{process was}} {{patented}} by Bell in 1785, fifteen {{years after his}} use of an <b>engraved</b> <b>plate</b> to print textiles. Bell's patent was for a machine to print six colours at once, but, probably owing to its incomplete development, it was not immediately successful. One colour could be printed with satisfactorily; the difficulty {{was to keep the}} six rollers in register with each other. This defect was overcome by Adam Parkinson of Manchester in 1785. That year, Bells machine with Parkinson's improvement was successfully employed by Messrs Livesey, Hargreaves and Company of Bamber Bridge, Preston, for the printing of calico in from two to six colours at a single operation.|$|E
