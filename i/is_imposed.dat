5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
5|$|Against this existential {{threat and}} fraying social order, the film also explores how {{individual}} characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments {{on a cell}} line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fianc√© {{to leave the city}} before a public quarantine <b>is</b> <b>imposed,</b> Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E

On slender rings, Neumann boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed,</b> while on solid rings, Dirichlet boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed.</b> Imposing one BC or the other implies calculating the local velocity or the local velocity potential.|$|R

25|$|United States federal {{probation}} and supervised release are imposed at sentencing. The difference between {{probation and}} supervised release {{is that the}} former <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> {{as a substitute for}} imprisonment, or in addition to home detention, while the latter <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> in addition to imprisonment. Probation and supervised release are both administered by the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. Federal probation has existed since 1909, while supervised release has only existed since 1987, when it replaced federal parole as a means for imposing supervision on releasees from prison.|$|E
50|$|The United States has an {{assortment}} of federal, state, local, and special-purpose governmental jurisdictions. Each imposes taxes to fully or partly fund its operations. These taxes may <b>be</b> <b>imposed</b> on the same income, property or activity, often without offset of one tax against another. The types of tax imposed at each level of government vary, {{in part due to}} constitutional restrictions. Income taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> at the federal and most state levels. Taxes on property <b>are</b> typically <b>imposed</b> only at the local level, though there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property. Other excise taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by the federal and some state governments. Sales taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by most states and many local governments. Customs duties or tariffs <b>are</b> only <b>imposed</b> by the federal government. A wide variety of user fees or license fees <b>are</b> also <b>imposed.</b>|$|R
