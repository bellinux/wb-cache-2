5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone <b>insulin.</b> <b>Insulin</b> is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to <b>insulin</b> receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. <b>Insulin</b> causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases <b>insulin</b> sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved <b>insulin</b> binding to <b>insulin</b> receptors. The increase in <b>insulin</b> binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>insulin</b> {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of <b>insulin</b> once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of <b>insulin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue <b>insulin</b> administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw <b>insulin</b> and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide {{as a measure of}} <b>insulin</b> production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|In various {{situations}} such as infection, <b>insulin</b> demands rise {{but are not}} {{matched by}} the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of <b>insulin</b> increases further {{by way of a}} vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) of <b>insulin</b> of 0.1unit of <b>insulin</b> per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium level {{is known to be}} higher than 3.3mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering <b>insulin</b> could lead to a dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of <b>insulin</b> until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting <b>insulin</b> analogs injections under the skin for mild or moderate cases.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is safe in {{pregnancy}} {{and women with}} gestational diabetes treated with metformin have less weight gain during pregnancy than those treated with <b>insulin.</b> Babies born to women treated with metformin {{have been found to}} develop less visceral fat, making them less prone to <b>insulin</b> resistance in later life.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{may reduce}} <b>insulin</b> {{requirement}} in type 1 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Spence was {{scheduled}} to have a medical examination on 11 March and it was considered plausible {{that he may have}} taken extra <b>insulin</b> to prepare himself for the examination. An overdose of <b>insulin,</b> or irregular doses, can distort the senses and cause the muscles to be unco-ordinated.|$|E
5|$|The first protein to be sequenced was <b>insulin,</b> by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger {{correctly}} {{determined the}} {{amino acid sequence}} of <b>insulin,</b> thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including <b>insulin</b> {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize <b>insulin</b> contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>insulin</b> they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
25|$|An <b>insulin</b> pump is an {{alternative}} to multiple daily injections of <b>insulin</b> by <b>insulin</b> syringes or an <b>insulin</b> pen and allows for intensive <b>insulin</b> therapy when {{used in conjunction with}} blood glucose monitoring and carb counting.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthetic human <b>insulin</b> (<b>insulin</b> human rDNA, INN) for {{clinical}} use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Biosynthetic human <b>insulin</b> has increased purity when compared with extractive animal <b>insulin,</b> enhanced purity reducing antibody formation. Researchers have succeeded in introducing the gene for human <b>insulin</b> into plants as another method of producing <b>insulin</b> ("biopharming") in safflower. This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Insulin</b> {{is usually}} taken as {{subcutaneous}} injections by single-use syringes with needles, via an <b>insulin</b> pump, or by repeated-use <b>insulin</b> pens with disposable needles. Inhaled <b>insulin</b> {{is also available}} in the U.S. market now.|$|E
25|$|Fasting <b>insulin</b> {{level or}} GTT with <b>insulin</b> levels (also called IGTT). Elevated <b>insulin</b> levels {{have been helpful}} to predict {{response}} to medication and may indicate women needing higher dosages of metformin {{or the use of}} a second medication to significantly lower <b>insulin</b> levels. Elevated blood sugar and <b>insulin</b> values do not predict who responds to an insulin-lowering medication, low-glycemic diet, and exercise. Many women with normal levels may benefit from combination therapy. A hypoglycemic response in which the two-hour <b>insulin</b> level is higher and the blood sugar lower than fasting is consistent with <b>insulin</b> resistance. A mathematical derivation known as the HOMAI, calculated from the fasting values in glucose and <b>insulin</b> concentrations, allows a direct and moderately accurate measure of <b>insulin</b> sensitivity (glucose-level x insulin-level/22.5).|$|E
25|$|These {{modifications}} {{have been}} used to create two types of <b>insulin</b> analogs: those that are more readily absorbed from the injection site and therefore act faster than natural <b>insulin</b> injected subcutaneously, intended to supply the bolus level of <b>insulin</b> needed at mealtime (prandial insulin); and those that are released slowly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours, intended to supply the basal level of <b>insulin</b> during the day and particularly at nighttime (basal <b>insulin).</b> The first <b>insulin</b> analog approved for human therapy (<b>insulin</b> Lispro rDNA) was manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.|$|E
25|$|An <b>insulin</b> pump {{allows the}} {{replacement}} of slow-acting <b>insulin</b> for basal needs with a continuous infusion of rapid-acting <b>insulin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Insulin</b> pumps, cartridges, and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for <b>insulin</b> injection with several <b>insulin</b> pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of <b>insulin</b> pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the <b>insulin</b> is inactivated by heat exposure, if the <b>insulin</b> reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and <b>insulin</b> leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or kinked in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>insulin</b> delivery.|$|E
25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} <b>insulin</b> are available. These <b>insulin</b> analogs {{are closely related}} to the human <b>insulin</b> structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic <b>insulin</b> analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial <b>insulin),</b> Humalog (<b>insulin</b> lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular <b>insulin,</b> with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human <b>insulin</b> and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (<b>insulin</b> glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted <b>insulin</b> analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the <b>insulin</b> molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal <b>insulin.</b> A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted <b>insulin</b> is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an <b>insulin</b> profile that mimics that of the body´s own <b>insulin</b> release.|$|E
25|$|Within vertebrates, {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of <b>insulin</b> is strongly conserved. Bovine <b>insulin</b> differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine <b>insulin</b> in one. Even <b>insulin</b> from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. <b>Insulin</b> in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human <b>insulin,</b> and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the <b>insulin</b> sequence of diverse species suggests {{that it has been}} conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.|$|E
25|$|An <b>insulin</b> pump is {{a medical}} device used for the {{administration}} of <b>insulin</b> {{in the treatment of}} diabetes mellitus, also known as continuous subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> infusion therapy.|$|E
25|$|Novo Nordisk created <b>insulin</b> detemir {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Levemir as a {{long-lasting}} <b>insulin</b> analogue for maintaining the basal level of <b>insulin.</b> The basal level of <b>insulin</b> may be maintained for up to 20 hours, but the time {{is affected by the}} size of the injected dose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Insulin</b> also {{influences}} {{other body}} functions, such as vascular compliance and cognition. Once <b>insulin</b> enters the human brain, it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular. Enhancing brain <b>insulin</b> signaling {{by means of}} intranasal <b>insulin</b> administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous <b>insulin</b> contributes to the co-ordination {{of a wide variety}} of homeostatic or regulatory processes in the human body. <b>Insulin</b> also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, thus favoring fertility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Insulin</b> {{pumps are}} being used for infusing {{pramlintide}} (brand name Symlin, or synthetic amylin) with <b>insulin</b> for improved postprandial glycemic control compared to <b>insulin</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|Exubera (inhalable <b>insulin)</b> for diabetes, and <b>insulin</b> therapies.|$|E
25|$|The company's most {{important}} products introduced prior to World War II included <b>insulin,</b> which Lilly marketed as Iletin (<b>Insulin,</b> Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts. Introduced in 1923, Iletin (<b>Insulin,</b> Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial <b>insulin</b> product. In 2002 {{the company was}} the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Easy {{delivery}} of multiple <b>insulin</b> injections for those using intensive <b>insulin</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|If {{the amount}} of <b>insulin</b> {{available}} is insufficient, if cells respond poorly {{to the effects of}} <b>insulin</b> (<b>insulin</b> insensitivity or <b>insulin</b> resistance), or if the <b>insulin</b> itself is defective, then glucose will not be absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and it will not be stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose, poor protein synthesis, and other metabolic derangements, such as acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Eli Lilly and Company {{developed}} and marketed the first rapid-acting <b>insulin</b> analogue (<b>insulin</b> lispro rDNA) Humalog. It was engineered through recombinant DNA technology {{so that the}} penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the B-chain were reversed. This modification did not alter the <b>insulin</b> receptor binding, but blocked the formation of <b>insulin</b> dimers and hexamers. This allowed larger amounts of active monomeric <b>insulin</b> to be available for postprandial (after meal) injections.|$|E
25|$|The human <b>insulin</b> {{protein is}} {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. <b>Insulin</b> from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human <b>insulin</b> because of these variations. Porcine <b>insulin</b> is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human <b>insulin</b> could be produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technologies.|$|E
25|$|In MODY1 and MODY3, <b>insulin</b> {{may be more}} {{effective}} than drugs to increase <b>insulin</b> sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} obesity clearly {{contributes}} to <b>insulin</b> resistance, {{which in turn}} can cause type 2 diabetes. Virtually all obese and most type 2 diabetic individuals have marked <b>insulin</b> resistance. Although the association between overweight and <b>insulin</b> resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of <b>insulin</b> resistance remain less clear. It {{is important to note}} that it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise, more regular food intake, and reducing glycemic load (see below) all can reverse <b>insulin</b> resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower their blood sugar level, in those with type 2 diabetes).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{constant}} flux of FFA (Free Fatty Acids) entering and leaving adipose tissue. The net direction of this flux is controlled by <b>insulin</b> and leptin—if <b>insulin</b> is elevated, {{then there is a}} net inward flux of FFA, and only when <b>insulin</b> is low can FFA leave adipose tissue. <b>Insulin</b> secretion is stimulated by high blood sugar, which results from consuming carbohydrates.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic <b>insulin</b> {{can trigger}} adverse effects, so {{some people with}} {{diabetes}} rely on animal-source <b>insulin.</b>|$|E
25|$|On other tissues: {{increasing}} <b>insulin</b> resistance. TNF phosphorylates <b>insulin</b> receptor serine residues, {{blocking signal}} transduction.|$|E
25|$|Once an <b>insulin</b> {{molecule}} has docked {{onto the}} receptor and effected its action, {{it may be}} released back into the extracellular environment, {{or it may be}} degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for <b>insulin</b> clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most <b>insulin</b> during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the <b>insulin</b> in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme. An <b>insulin</b> molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (<b>insulin</b> half-life ~ 4–6minutes).|$|E
