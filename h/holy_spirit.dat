5|$|Baptism in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> when Peter and John laid their hands on them. The Apostle Paul was also filled with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, baptism {{with the}} <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> (also called baptism in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> or Spirit baptism) is {{distinguished}} from baptism with water. It is frequently associated with {{incorporation into the}} Christian Church, the bestowal of spiritual gifts, and empowerment for Christian ministry.|$|E
5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> and are incorporated {{into the body of}} Christ.|$|E

5|$|Jesus is {{considered}} {{the first person to}} receive the baptism with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit.</b> The <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> descended on Jesus during his baptism and anointed him with power.

5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the article of faith on the baptism of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial second coming of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, the belief that the baptism with the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit,</b> and the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E

5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit.</b> The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E

5|$|In May 1908, five American missionaries—John G. Lake and Thomas Hezmalhalch, {{along with}} their wives, and A. Lehman—arrived in South Africa from Indianapolis. Lake and Hezmalhalch had links to Dowie's Zion City and had been baptized in the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. Despite these influences, however, the missionaries had no {{organizational}} affiliation. Arriving in Pretoria, Lake felt that the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> was leading him to Johannesburg because they found no doors open in Pretoria. In Johannesburg, a Mrs Goodenough met them and invited them to stay in her house. She witnessed that the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> had sent her {{to the train station}} to meet the American missionaries. They first began ministry at a rental hall in Doornfontein, a Johannesburg suburb, on 25 May 1908. The services consisted of a mixed racial group, and many who attended the first services were Zionists. The missionaries moved to the Central Tabernacle, Bree Street, Johannesburg as the young Pentecostal movement grew. It was there that the Apostolic Faith Mission developed, initially as a committee first meeting in September 1908. It was not registered as a legal entity until 1913, however.|$|E
5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit</b> to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Spirit,</b> compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|Synan {{traces the}} {{influence}} of Catholic and Anglican mystical traditions on John Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection or entire sanctification, from which Pentecostal beliefs on Spirit baptism developed.
