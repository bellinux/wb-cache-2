25|$|Efficacy {{and risks}} of {{catheter}} ablation of AF are areas of active debate. A worldwide {{survey of the}} outcomes of 8745 ablation procedures demonstrated a 52% success rate (ranging from 14.5% to 76.5% among centers), with an additional 23.9% of patients becoming asymptomatic with addition of an antiarrhythmic medication. In 27.3% of patients, more than one procedure was required to attain these results. There {{was at least one}} major complication in 6% of patients. Death has been found to occur in 1 in 1000 people who undergo this procedure. A thorough <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> of catheter ablation was published in 2007; it notes that results are widely variable, due in part to differences in technique, follow-up, definitions of success, use of antiarrhythmic therapy, and in experience and technical proficiency.|$|E
50|$|Task III is {{an ongoing}} R&D-oriented effort with clearly defined {{technical}} objectives, time schedule and expected results. Activities are cost-shared, task-shared (either through SolarPACES or among SolarPACES participants), and/or information-shared. Cost-sharing and task-sharing activities involve cooperative efforts {{of two or more}} participants where either costs of activities or responsibilities for activities, respectively, are mutually agreed upon and shared by the Participants. Information sharing is used for the exchange and <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> of projects carried out independently by Participants, but of interest to all.|$|E

5000|$|Initially and interchangeably {{called the}} North American Hyperthermia Group (NAHG) {{for a number}} of years, the North American Hyperthermia Society was founded in 1981 by those who shared the opinion that {{hyperthermia}} continued to show promise as a therapeutic modality, and that the growing numbers of investigators and the amount of data produced required a separate [...] for <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> and planning future directions of research and application. The idea for a new society was conceived during the meeting of the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology in Dallas, Texas in 1980 and led to an organizational meeting at the winter meeting of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Society in Diego on Coronado Island, January 1981. D.B. Leeper was elected chairman of the Organizing Committee and served in that capacity for four years. The first of what became annual meetings was held on May 31, 1981, in Minneapolis in association with {{the annual meeting of the}} Radiation Research Society. The close association between the North American Hyperthermia Society and the Radiation Research Society continues to this day. In 1986 a constitution and bylaws were adopted, and the North American Hyperthermia Society was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a tax-exempt scientific organization for hyperthermia research. The first elected president of the newly constituted society was M.W. Dewhirst.|$|E
