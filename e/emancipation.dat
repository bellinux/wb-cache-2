5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term <b>emancipation</b> while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the <b>emancipation</b> petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when the <b>emancipation</b> petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the <b>emancipation</b> papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the <b>emancipation</b> petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E

5|$|George IV {{spent most}} of his later reign in {{seclusion}} at Windsor Castle, but he continued to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support Catholic <b>emancipation,</b> as he had proposed a Catholic <b>Emancipation</b> Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic <b>emancipation</b> in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic <b>emancipation</b> seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Morton {{attended}} the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation. <b>Emancipation</b> and the conscription {{of men to}} fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton's tenure as governor.|$|E
5|$|In France {{the album}} debuted {{at its peak}} {{position}} of number four on April 9, 2005. The record spent a total of fifty-one weeks in the chart, and was certified gold by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), signifying shipments of 100,000 copies. Eight months after its release in Europe, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi platinum, denoting shipments of onemillion units throughout the continent. In Hong Kong it was awarded a Gold Disc Award, which is issued to the ten best-selling foreign albums each year. The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi debuted at number two on the Japanese Albums Chart, and was certified platinum (250,000 units shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi had sold 7.7million copies globally, and was the second best-selling album of the year, after Coldplay's X. It was the best-selling album by a solo and female artist. As of today, The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi has sold 12 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} {{the abolition of}} slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), <b>emancipation</b> occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), <b>emancipation</b> was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated <b>emancipation.</b> By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation, {{issued on}} September 22, 1862, {{and put into}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing {{the army and the}} nation for <b>emancipation,</b> while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 led to expansion {{of the federal government}} and notable growth in the District's population, including a large influx of freed slaves. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated <b>Emancipation</b> Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the District of Columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons, nine months prior to the <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation. In 1868, Congress granted the District's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.|$|E
5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once <b>emancipation</b> became an issue in 1862, the Republicans {{suffered}} a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of <b>emancipation</b> and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi {{entered the}} Australian Albums Chart on April 17, 2005, at number 13. During the {{following}} week, it peaked at and spent one week at number six. The album spent {{a total of}} forty-six weeks on the chart. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) – denoting shipments of 70,000 unit – and finished at number twenty-seven on the End of Year Chart. In Canada The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi debuted and peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 11,000 units. The album was certified triple platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipments of 240,000 units. The <b>Emancipation</b> of Mimi debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart dated April 6, 2005. On July 23, fourteen weeks after its debut, the album once again reached its peak position of number seven. After one re-entry, the album spent a combined forty-three weeks in the albums chart, being certified double-platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 copies. By May 2008, the album's British sales stood at 621,352 units.|$|E
5|$|Washington, D.C., observes {{all federal}} {{holidays}} and also celebrates <b>Emancipation</b> Day on April 16, which commemorates {{the end of}} slavery in the District. The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Anti-slavery campaigners, {{inspired}} by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started {{some of the}} earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to be the beginning of movements for reform and women's <b>emancipation.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish <b>Emancipation.</b> The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
5|$|At age 15, {{with her}} parents' approval, she filed for <b>emancipation</b> from them, {{so she could}} better pursue her acting career with less {{interference}} from child labor work laws. After completing ninth grade at Santa Fe Christian Schools, in Solana Beach, California, she left school because of severe bullying. Subsequently, Williams was home-tutored by her father and later graduated with a GED from a correspondence school.|$|E
5|$|Barbadian {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current {{at the time of}} their composition, such as the <b>emancipation</b> of the slaves of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential Barbadian folk songs are associated with the island's lower-class laborers, who have held on to their folk heritage.|$|E
5|$|By July 1808, Breckinridge {{had decided}} to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies. His roommate, James G. Birney, and the {{university}} president, Samuel Stanhope Smith, were both ardent abolitionists, and through their influence, he became convinced that slavery must be ended, but only by voluntary <b>emancipation,</b> not by government interference. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1810.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for <b>emancipation</b> rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic <b>Emancipation</b> and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic <b>emancipation</b> bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Burke {{was elected}} as Whig Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1774 and campaigned for free trade, Catholic <b>emancipation</b> {{and the rights}} of the American colonists, but he angered his {{merchant}} sponsors with his detestation of the slave trade and lost the seat in 1780.|$|E
5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he {{called for an end to}} slavery. Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed <b>emancipation</b> of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, when it {{appeared}} highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic <b>emancipation.</b> Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, Floyd {{received}} {{votes for}} the Presidency of the United States, running in the Nullifier Party. He carried South Carolina and its 11 electoral votes. While governor of Virginia, the Nat Turner slave rebellion occurred and Floyd initially supported <b>emancipation</b> of slavery, but eventually went with the majority. His term as governor saw economic prosperity for the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, a number of ex-slaves of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian descent and emigrants from Sierra Leone {{established}} communities in Lagos and other regions of Nigeria. Many ex-slaves came to Nigeria following the <b>emancipation</b> of slaves in the Americas. Many of the immigrants, sometimes called Saros (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil) later became prominent merchants and missionaries in these cities.|$|E
5|$|Jackson and Zach Wamp were spokespersons for the {{changing}} {{the name of}} the main hall of the United States Capitol Visitor Center from the Great Hall to <b>Emancipation</b> Hall. The Library of Congress's main hall was already designated Great Hall. Some had wanted further feedback on naming possibilities, but the United States House Committee on Appropriations approved the new name, and it passed the House.|$|E
5|$|Juneteenth, {{which is}} the oldest nationally celebrated {{commemoration}} of the ending of slavery in the United States, owes its origins to {{the announcement of the}} <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation upon the return of Union forces to Galveston in 1865. Galveston was the first city in Texas to provide a secondary school and public library for African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{understood}} that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At {{the beginning of the}} war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated <b>emancipation</b> in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited <b>emancipation</b> attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, {{on the grounds that it}} was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon emancipated Jews, {{as well as}} Protestants in Catholic {{countries}} and Catholics in Protestant countries, from laws which restricted them to ghettos, and he expanded their rights to property, worship, and careers. Despite the anti-semitic reaction to Napoleon's policies from foreign governments and within France, he believed <b>emancipation</b> would benefit France by attracting Jews to the country given the restrictions they faced elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, Grant's army {{defeated}} Confederates at the Battle of Iuka, then successfully defended Corinth, inflicting heavy casualties. On October 25, Grant assumed {{command of}} the District of the Tennessee. In November, after Lincoln's preliminary <b>Emancipation</b> Proclamation, Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate former slaves into the Union Army, giving them clothes, shelter and wages for their services.|$|E
