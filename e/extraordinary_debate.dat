40|$|Labor’s stand was a {{long time}} coming, says Mike Willis THE <b>extraordinary</b> <b>debate</b> over the {{potential}} impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement triggered by Labor’s proposed legislative amendments has underscored the ironies that surrounded the negotiations from the start. This is hardly surprising given that gullibility, political expediency and a determined campaign to subdue voices critical of the FTA have all featured in the debate so far. Irony # 1 Only at the eleventh hour of the FTA process has there stirred in the political and public consciousness at least some realisation that the way Australia chooses to frame its patent laws can affect the cost of supplying medicines to its citizens and, as a direct consequence, the cost of the PBS. The fact that this happened so late is an indictment of a flawed, secretive trade negotiation process and a media either too complicit or too uncritical of government and private interests, which were determined to manage the way the FTA public debate unfolded. These interests have been aided and abetted by at least one parliamentary committee process more intent on ridiculing opposing viewpoints than seeking to illuminate complex legal issues. (See, for example, some of the trite exchanges between government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Treaties examining the AUSFTA and witnesses appearing for the Doctors Reform Society and the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network. Then look at the forelock-tugging and fawning questioning which greeted the pro-FTA acolytes, the likes of Michael Baume and Alan Oxley.) Irony # 2 At a time when public concerns might benefit from timely, arms-length advice about links between patent law, pharmaceuticals and the cost of the Pharmaceuitical Benefits Scheme, the agency ostensibly responsible for providing such advice - IP Australia - remains very compromised in providing it. IP Australia has rather oddly defined as its prime corporate aim the task of ensuring that the Australian intellectual property system ‘meets business needs’. Yet practitioners know that the lega; system confers on an intellectual property owner what are essentially monopoly privileges to exploit a created invention - always with conditions - in exchange for a potential public benefit from that innovation. This has always involved a balancing act between the rights of patent holders and other interested parties. In these circumstances, which ‘business needs’ does IP Australia ensure are met: the interests of Pfizer Australia or of the generic manufacturer Alphapharm Pty Ltd? More to the point, who looks after the public interest side of the equation? The existence of a line of government agencies captive to the Howard government 2 ̆ 7 s policy line poses a potentially serious problem for public administration in Australia. In this instance, that position seems to deem that the interests of business are synonymous with ‘the national interest’. To put it in the vernacular - and borrowing heavily from Mark Latham - the Australian public is not well served by a conga line of departmental and government agency ‘suck holes’. Irony # 3 There’s some irony in recent media coverage of the movement of several prominent US trade officials and negotiators from a close association with government to jobs in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Similar examples closer to home have passed unnoticed. Prior to taking up his position in February of last year, the current CEO of Medicines Australia, Kieran Schneemann, worked in the Office of Minister for Science and Technology and then for several years with the federal government minister Nick Minchin in the industry and finance portfolios. (Medicines Australia is the national lobby group representing the pharmaceutical industry. Its title is the stuff of public relations genius, for ‘Medicines Australia’ signifies something quite different from that of ‘IP Australia’, ‘Environment Australia’ and ‘Biotechnology Australia’, all of which are federal government agencies.) It’s reported that his work for Senator Minchin included an advisory role on the government’s Pharmaceutical Industry Investment Program. Mr Schneemann’s immediate predecessor as CEO of Medicines Australia was Alan Evans, formerly First Assistant Secretary in the federal Industry Department. According to available biographical material, Mr Evans had policy responsibility for a number of industry sectors including information technology, pharmaceuticals and health care. As a former Executive General Manager of AusIndustry, Mr Evans was responsible for managing a number of the federal government’s industry programs including the R&D tax concession and R&D grants. Irony # 4 It is also a very great irony that the ALP has (apparently) come to some belated realisation that the manner in which Australia chooses to frame its patent law regime can affect the types of medicines the public has access to and, as a consequence, the cost of the PBS. The difficulty for Labor’s credibility is that this new ‘understanding’ has to be set against a persistent pattern of past neglect by the ALP of the economic, social and health impact of IP protection laws in Australia. First, the ALP was in government at the time the most extensive and contentious multilateral global agreement on IP protection (the TRIPs Agreement of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, 1986 - 94) was finalised. No cost-benefit analysis of its implementation in Australia was ever conducted. As John Braithwaite and Peter Drahos observe in their book Global Business Regulation, not one newspaper account at the time referred to costs ‘that Australia would bear as a result of TRIPs’. Analysts from the (then) Industry Commission later argued that the direct cost to the Australian economy of extending patent term protection retrospectively under TRIPs could approach 4 billion. Their analysis estimated that two thirds of that cost went in the form of ‘windfall gains’ to pharmaceutical companies as a result of extending the patent term to patents then in force. That outcome kept patents in force for a further four years in Australia with the attendant delay of cheaper generic products onto the pharmaceutical market. Second, Australia’s current patent law regime for pharmaceuticals - even before the AUSFTA takes effect - confers possibly the highest levels of protection to pharmaceutical companies of any place in the world. It permits patent term extensions for pharmaceuticals to a total of 25 years while there’s a standard patent term of 20 years for all other products. Labor (as well as other non-government parties) actively supported the legislation. The parliamentary debate which accompanied the passage of the legislation was distinguished by its ignorance of intellectual property law and lack of concern about its implications. Incredibly, the extension scheme has resulted in a majority of patents expiring later in Australia than they do in the US and Europe. With the support of the ALP, we have a scheme which has been of clear benefit to foreign pharmaceutical companies, added significantly to PBS costs and, according to the Productivity Commission, constituted a costly barrier to Australian exports of generic products. This same piece of legislation also included ‘spring-boarding’ provisions, which allow generic manufacturers to work on the pharmaceutical substance, before the patent expires, in order to obtain regulatory approval. What gets overlooked is that the way these provisions have been framed in Australia restricts generic manufacturers more so than similar provisions in both the US and Canada. Finally, Australia has also chosen to legislate for additional pharmaceutical protection, in the form of ‘data exclusivity’ provisions for pharmaceuticals. These, too, gained support from the ALP, {{despite the fact that they}} exceed our international requirements, are weighted in favour of pharmaceutical companies and potentially delay the entry of generic products onto the market. And it is also despite the fact that the available economic and legal advice was that raising intellectual property standards beyond accepted international norms was not be in Australia’s national interest (see, for example, the framework paper prepared by the National Innovation Summit Working Group on Managing Intellectual Property, 1999, p 51) While the total cost to the PBS of Australia’s present high patent protection level for pharmaceuticals has never been quantified, it is clearly significant. This is the backdrop to the ALP’s apparent coming of age in its desire to prevent delays to the entry of generic medicines onto the pharmaceutical market. Let the ALP question the rationale for these provisions. That will be the test. Mike Willis is an Intellectual Property Law Consultant, Specialist Researcher and Sessional Law Lecturer.

There was no Granger causality from the eliminated variables if the conditional and marginal distributions of the remaining variables were the same. In practice, the non-operational nature of his definition was finessed by testing whether dropping a subset of variables from a larger set affected the goodness of fit of models of the remaining variables. This paper notes the drawbacks that arise from such a route to making his concept of causality operational, but also emphasises its pervasive role in econometric modelling of time series...|$|R

40|$|One of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO 2 ̆ 7 s) more {{remarkable}} and controversial innovations is its mechanism for resolving trade disputes among member states. Traditionally, states have resolved such disputes in 2 ̆ 2 pragmatic 2 ̆ 2 fashion, through negotiation and compromise {{informed by the}} relative power of the parties involved. But no longer: the WTO 2 ̆ 7 s Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (the DSU) provides that disputes between member states are to be resolved in adversary proceedings before impartial panels of experts. 2 ̆ 2 Under the DSU, panels have authority to decide whether members 2 ̆ 7 laws violate international trade norms; panel decisions are essentially binding, {{though there is a}} right of appeal to an Appellate Body within the WTO. If an offending party in a dispute fails to implement a final decision, the complaining party may seek compensation from it. If the parties cannot agree on the appropriate level of compensation, the complaining party may retaliate by suspending trade concessions it has made to the offending party. The WTO 2 ̆ 7 s turn to 2 ̆ 2 trade legalism 2 ̆ 2 has sparked a heated debate. Some commentators favor the new approach, praising its predictability, uniformity, and fairness. Others contend that the new approach will lead to a loss of national sovereignty and democratic self-government. On one thing, both sides agree: supporters and opponents alike believe that WTO rulings will have a profound impact on the policies of member states. To students of American constitutional history, the debate over the WTO has a familiar ring. We take it for granted today that the United States Supreme Court has authority to review the judgments of state courts on questions of federal law. In {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, though, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s assertion of appellate jurisdiction over state courts caused great controversy. Antebellum Americans debated the merits of Supreme Court review in a manner remarkably similar to the way in which today 2 ̆ 7 s Americans debate the merits of the WTO. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s supporters asserted that its review of state court judgments promoted uniformity, predictability, and compliance with federal norms. Its opponents contended that Supreme Court review posed dangers for state sovereignty and representative democracy. To its opponents, in Jefferson 2 ̆ 7 s words, the Court seemed an 2 ̆ 2 instrument which, working like gravity 2 ̆ 2 would obliterate the states and 2 ̆ 2 press us at last into one consolidated mass. This article explores the nineteenth-century conflict over Supreme Court review and discusses its implications for today 2 ̆ 7 s debate on the WTO. Part I of this article describes the DSU and examines the arguments of supporters and critics. Part II explores the nineteenth-century controversy over Supreme Court review. It focuses on three important episodes: the conflict with Virginia in connection with Martin and Cohens v. Virginia; the conflict with Georgia in connection with the Cherokee cases—a conflict that served as backdrop for some <b>extraordinary</b> congressional <b>debates</b> on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction; and the conflict with Wisconsin in connection with Abelman v.

40|$|This Groundbreaking Exhibition Explores Global Trend of Transforming Ordinary Mass-Produced Objects into One-Of-A-Kind Works of Art The Museum of Arts and Design inaugurates its {{new home}} at Columbus Circle with Second Lives: Remixing the Ordinary, a special {{thematic}} exhibition featuring 54 contemporary artists from 18 countries who transform discarded, commonplace, or valueless objects into extraordinary works of art. On view from September 27 through March, 2009, Second Lives includes new commissions and site-specific installations, created from gun triggers, spools of thread, tires, hypodermic needles, dog tags, old eyeglasses, and telephone books, among other manufactured and mass-produced objects. Highlighting the creative processes that re-purpose these objects, the exhibition explores {{the transformation of}} the ordinary into the <b>extraordinary</b> and stimulates <b>debate</b> on function, value, and identity. “Reflecting the Museum’s core mission of celebrating materials and process, Second Lives explores the creative approaches of contemporary artists who give existing objects new life and meaning by transforming them into compelling works of art,” said Holly Hotchner, the Nanette L. Laitman Director of the Museum of Arts and Design. “We live in a world populated—and sometimes overpopulated —with consumer products. These artists make magic using society’s castoffs and overlooked items. While the focus of the exhibition is neither on sustainability nor recycling, the works in the exhibition are catalysts for thought and discussion about these issues. Second Lives is especially timely as MAD marks its own second life as a renewed institution and as Columbus Circle enjoys its own renaissance. ” Organized by Chief Curator David Revere McFadden, Curator Lowery Stokes Sims, and Adjunct Curator Brian Parkes, Second Lives reflects a current interest among international artists in using ordinary objects as raw materials. The works on view bear implicit social commentaries and explore themes of power, politics, identity, and value. Moreover, each work remains faithful to the highest standards of craftsmanship. These artists underscore the meaning of making and the transformative nature of creativity. “Our perceptions of objects as functional or aesthetic, cheap or invaluable are directly challenged by the works on view in Second Lives,” said McFadden. “The 54 artists featured are working in ways that resist categorization and that underscore a breakdown in the hierarchy that has traditionally separated art, craft, and design. Instead, these intricately crafted works reveal an intense engagement with ideas, meaning, materiality and process. ” The exhibition includes selected works from the 1990 s by such designers as Tejo Remy, Ingo Maurer, and the Campana brothers, among others, that provide an introduction to the repurposing of objects in design. The exhibition traces the development of this concept through a group of works created within the past eight years by both established and emerging artists, including, Ai Waiwai, Therese Agnew, El Anatsui, Hew Locke, Devorah Sperber, Cornelia Parker, Xu Bing, Do Ho Suh, Susie MacMurray and Fred Wilson, among others...|$|R
