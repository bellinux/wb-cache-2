5|$|Farid is a {{taxi driver}} who is {{initially}} abrasive toward Amir, but later befriends him. Two of Farid's seven children were killed by a land mine, a disaster which mutilated three fingers on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> also took some of his toes. After spending a night with Farid's brother's impoverished family, Amir hides a bundle of money under the mattress to help them.|$|E
5|$|Donatian {{stands in}} front of a set of windows that are just outside the {{pictorial}} space. He holds a jewelled processional cross in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> a wheel containing five lit tapered candles in his right. The wheel is his usual attribute, and refers to an incident when he nearly drowned after being flung into the Tiber, but was saved after Pope Dionysius threw him a carriage wheel he was able to use as a float.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

60|$|He grasped Everard's <b>hand</b> with <b>his</b> own <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{pressed the}} palm of his right to his face and forehead, sobbing aloud.|$|R

5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often the seductive nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his torso and buttocks. Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the trishula (trident) in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{obtained}} a commission from the Royal Air Force to portray airmen {{preparing for the}} Dieppe raid in August 1942 and they also allowed him to fly in their planes to develop pictures of the air war. He presented a painting, a cloudscape entitled The Battlefields of Britain, to Winston Churchill {{as a gift to}} the nation and which still hangs in Downing Street. Shortly afterwards a stroke paralysed his right hand and caused a speech impediment. He applied for a junior clerical post with WAAC and was refused. Nevinson taught himself to paint with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> had three pictures shown at the Royal Academy in the summer of 1946. He attended that exhibition, with the assistance of his wife Kathleen, in a wheelchair but died a few months later aged fifty-seven.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|In late 1980th, Mike started facing {{troubles}} {{related to}} health and household, mainly due to alcohol abuse. The motion of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> deteriorated <b>and</b> he could hardly play guitar. <b>His</b> wife <b>left</b> him.|$|R
50|$|Shoten may be also {{depicted}} as male alone. The deity figure(s) is/are portrayed as elephant-headed, with two, four, six, eight or twelve arms. However, his images are rarely displayed in public. When {{depicted as}} a male, Shoten is generally four-armed, holding a radish and a sweet (modak). He may also hold a mace, a sword, a cup of ambrosia or have two of his front arms folded. The six-armed aspect of Kangiten is described carrying a knife, a fruit bowl, a discus in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> a club, a noose and his broken tusk in his right.|$|R
50|$|On July 22, 2008, at a Sparks-Shock game, Mahorn {{attempted}} {{to break up}} a brawl. When attempting to restrain Lisa Leslie, he put <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> out <b>and</b> Leslie fell to the ground. Mahorn was suspended for two games.|$|R
5|$|The {{pavilion}} {{is built}} on a cruciform layout with {{the northern and southern}} ends being longer. The roof is topped with a spire of five-tiers, making it a prasat rather than a 'maha prasat' (which has seven). The spire is supported by swans as opposed to the traditional garudas. The eastern pediment depicts the Hindu god Shiva standing on a plinth with one foot raised, holding a sword in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> right hand raised to a blessing. The columns of the pavilion are decorated with gold and silver glass mosaic in a floral pattern; the capital of these columns take the form of long lotus petals.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{his right hand}} held high above his head, clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several {{have been identified as}} copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba {{is shown}} {{standing}} arms-akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik. He wears {{a necklace of}} tulsi-beads, embedded with the legendary kaustubha gem, and makara-kundala (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a chakra (discus) or lotus flower in his right, {{all of which are}} symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist.|$|E
50|$|Hananokuni′s favoured kimarite or {{techniques}} included yori taoshi (force out and down), uwatenage (overarm throw) and shitatedashinage (pulling {{inner arm}} throw. He used a migi yotsu {{grip on the}} mawashi, with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> outside <b>and</b> right <b>hand</b> inside his opponent′s arms.|$|R
5000|$|Daimanazuru had a {{straightforward}} fighting style, with around 70% of his wins being either yorikiri (force out) or oshidashi (push out).

5|$|During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is {{severely}} wounded during an RAF air raid in Tunisia, losing his right hand, {{the ring and}} little finger on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> his left eye, and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führers personal airplane. The bomb, however, is a dud and fails to detonate, and Tresckow flies to Berlin in order to safely retrieve it. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested Major General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht to find a replacement. After recruiting Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht presents Stauffenberg {{at a meeting of}} the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Erwin von Witzleben. Stauffenberg is stunned to learn that no plans exist on the subject of what is to be done after Hitler's assassination.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{participated in}} the {{pre-season}} camp with the Devils in September, but was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils after the camp. Josefson was called up to the Devils on 14 October 2010, and made his NHL debut the next day, in a 3–2 victory against Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center. Josefson was slashed on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> later fell on the same hand during the game against San Jose Sharks on 27 October, this caused a ligament in his thumb to tear, and forced him to undergo surgery. At last, Josefson returned from his injury on 7 January 2011, when the Albany Devils played against the Charlotte Checkers. Josefson scored his first NHL goal against Al Montoya of the New York Islanders on 12 March 2011. The Devils failed to reach the playoffs and Josefson ended up with three goals and ten points in 28 regular season games.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Clothier {{suffered}} a stroke and was in poor health {{until his death in}} 1999. After his stroke, he taught himself to paint with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife, Shirley Broderick, had two children, a daughter, Jessica, and a son, John and a granddaughter, Lucy.|$|R
5|$|Koufax had {{his strong}} season despite an injured {{pitching}} hand. While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so {{he ignored the}} problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and {{he was unable to}} complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers {{at the end of the}} regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.|$|E

50|$|Daidō {{preferred}} {{to fight on}} the opponent's mawashi or belt as opposed to pushing or thrusting. His favoured grip was migi-yotsu, with <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> outside <b>and</b> right <b>hand</b> inside in his opponent's arms. His most common winning kimarite was uwatenage, or overarm throw, followed by yori-kiri or force out.|$|R
50|$|Okinoumi is a yotsu-sumo fighter, preferring {{grappling}} {{techniques to}} pushing or thrusting.
