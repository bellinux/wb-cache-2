It starts by presenting the door-to-door transport cost as a key concept in price theory for public transport, and then first principles of optimal pricing valid for all modes of public transport are laid down. These principles are applied to urban (short-distance) public transport in sections 13. 2 – 13. 5 and to <b>inter-urban</b> (long-distance) public <b>transport</b> in section 13. 6.

In contrast with the current ABM approaches, it considers a multi-regional (multi-urban) setting to enable a more realistic representation of decisions related to commuting, migration and household and employment location. The model allows simulating spatially differentiated, multi-commodity markets for land and labor in a system of cities and the behavior of profit-maximizing firms with multi-regional asset investment decisions, incorporating endogenous intra- and <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> costs with congestion effects. It also accounts for the impact of industrial and urban agglomeration forces on location choices and the formation of urban development patterns. Other features include the representation of the actions of central and local government agents to address issues of territorial development, efficiency and equity. The simulation set-up and evolutionary analysis of the spatial ABM are presented and several implications are discussed with regard to the possible outcomes of a set of policy interventions...|$|E
40|$|New {{information}} and telecommunication technologies in the transport sector, often named `Advanced Transport Telematics' (ATT), {{play a key}} role in thenew European network economy, as they have the potential to offer new solutions to the emerging transport problems in Europe. However, the successfulexploitation of ATT in European transport markets depends on the technology being implemented in a way which meets the distinct needs of the differentroad user groups in order to achieve social acceptance and thereby political approval. It is therefore vitally important that decision makers (i. e. those influencing theadoption of ATT) have sufficient information on the needs of (commercial) road users and on the way they perceive ATT options in addressing those needs. The ATT market comprises a large number of actors from both the public and the private sector. At the demand side, some major potential market sectorscan be identified. In addition to private users, there are intermediate or collective users (e. g., road authorities) and commercial users (e. g., thefreight sector). In the latter case ATT may play a strategic role by facing the need of the freight sector to orient itself towards the opportunitiesoffered by theEuropean internal market, which has far-reaching impacts not only on organisations operating in intemational networks, but also on those operatingnationally. The aim of the underlying study is to investigate the potential ATT market among these main user and interest groups, where the range of telematicsapplications will be restricted to those applied to <b>inter-urban</b> road <b>transport.</b> The focus will be on collective users (road managers) and commercialusers (road freight operators).

40|$|The {{merits of}} {{alternative}} urban and <b>inter-urban</b> public <b>transport</b> {{systems have been}} the subject of some debate, particularly since the publication of the UK’s 1998 transport policy White Paper A New Deal for Transport. This current paper aims to assess some of the conflicting empirical evidence in the UK and abroad in order to allow an objective assessment of the policy implications. Section 2 presents an overview of technical and financial characteristics of mainly urban public transport systems, including capital and operating costs of recent light rail, guided bus, bus priority and suburban rail systems. Section 3 explores the evidence on the wider costs and benefits of systems in the UK, including wider environmental and socio-economic impacts. Although more expensive to build (under similar conditions), light rail systems often carry more passengers than ‘intermediate’ bus-based systems such as guided bus and segregated busways. There is not much between public transport systems on the basis of operating costs per passenger-km, except metro systems, which are twice as expensive to run as busbased systems. When comparing revenues and operating costs directly, all modes except suburban regional rail appear capable of covering operating costs overall, with light rail and some of London’s suburban rail services providing a marginal surplus of revenue. Average speeds of light rail and bus-based systems are comparable. In heavily congested corridors, new light rail systems can reduce journey times significantly, but such reductions are lower for bus-based systems, mainly because of the relatively limited amount of segregated right of way and priority at traffic signals. This highlights the fact that bus priority systems act primarily as ‘congestion busters’ at hot spots, which can be implemented more flexibly and gradually than for railbased systems. Currently, electric propulsion appears to be the best option to mitigate air pollution and noise. However, new clean vehicle technologies will soon be in a position to play a major role in reducing emissions, in particular for bus-based systems. In terms of external costs per bus/train-km, environmental costs appear higher than accident costs, but lower than congestion externalities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the main {{challenges}} that are facing the Transport sector in the countries of S. E. Europe after enlargement. First, it {{looks at the}} challenge of setting a common Transport policy and points as priority areas the questions of: frontier crossings, road transport quotas, working hours (road transport), restructuring of railways, promotion of Rail Freight “Freeways”, new financing schemes through Public Private Partnerships, and other issues. Then it looks at the factors that will determine the future transport outlook of the area in both qualitative and quantitative terms and it finds {{that there is a}} web of factors and issues that will play a role, such as for example the socio-political climate and preferences, the advent of New Technologies, and the degree of development of the Trans-European Networks. The paper looks at the “challenges ” facing the <b>inter-urban</b> and urban <b>transport</b> separately. As regards the first it concludes that a) higher integration of the transport provider into the whole transport and logistics chain, and b) closer co-operation and “integration ” with the customer, will be the main ones, while for urban transport the main challenge will be improvement of urban traffic management systems and, inevitably, demand management measures, as well as implementation and operation of a whole new series of technologies and systems of urban ICT that will form the Integrated Urban ICT environment of the future...|$|R
30|$|The {{integration}} {{strategies are}} driven by several motivations, as described in Section  2.2. As concerns the road passenger transport, the liberalisation process of the Italian industry and the consequent international calls for tender of urban or <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> services’ supply, published by different Italian municipalities, have attracted some European foreign MNE. In particular, the English big operator Arriva International PLC has undertaken different acquisitions of Italian firms, mainly located in the North (especially, Lombardy, Piedmont and Friuli-Venezia Giulia). Arriva is the first multinational company in terms of number of FDI on the total inward investments in the Italian logistics industry (5 % on the total Italian FDI and 22 % of the Italian investments made by the first ten global players 7 [27]). In this sector, the main motivation driving integrations is the aim to reinforce the market power in the European countries, taking advantage from the change of the regulation in specific country such as Italy. The efficiency considerations do not hold for this industry, because {{the production of the}} services is local based (i.e., it is impossible to use the same buses or infrastructure both in the London public transport and in the Milan urban area).|$|E
40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} short-term transport {{demand for}} an individual logistics company involved in a competitive market is critical to make short-term operation decisions. This article proposes a combined grey–periodic extension model with remnant correction to forecast the short-term <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> demand of a logistics company involved in a nationwide competitive market, showing changes in trend and seasonal fluctuations with irregular periods different to the macroeconomic cycle. A basic grey–periodic extension model of an additive pattern, namely, the main combination model, is first constructed to fit the changing trends and the featured seasonal fluctuation periods. In order to improve prediction accuracy and model adaptability, the grey model is repeatedly modelled to fit the remnant tail time series of the main combination model until prediction accuracy is satisfied. The modelling approach is applied to a logistics company engaged in a nationwide less-than-truckload road transportation business in China. The results demonstrate that the proposed modelling approach produces good forecasting results and goodness of fit, also showing good model adaptability to the analysed object in a changing macro environment. This fact makes this modelling approach an option to analyse the short-term transportation demand of an individual logistics company...|$|E
40|$|On-going {{urbanization}} has led {{to greater}} distances between homes and workplaces and more long-distance commuting, increasing the need for efficient <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure. For sustainability, trains are preferred to private cars. Two key variables affecting door-to-door train travel time are in-vehicle time (IVT) and headway; however, {{there is often a}} trade-off between speed and frequency in a system. If different categories of travellers value IVT and headway differently, their proportions on a route should affect traffic planning. Optimal system design might differ between routes carrying many commuters and routes carrying mainly passengers on single private or business trips. Knowledge of differences in relative valuations of headway versus IVT should therefore affect railway system design. We investigate whether the relative values of headway versus IVT differ between inter- urban commuting by train and single inter-urban trips by train, whilst also examining differences between socioeconomic groups. Stated choice (SC) data from 580 Swedish respondents are used in estimation. Individuals actually commuting and individuals not commuting but imagining that they are when answering the SC questions are asked about their preferences for headway versus IVT. Commuters are estimated to value increased headway 19 percentage points more than do non-commuters. Young people (under age 21 years) value headway more than do older people while people with children value headway less than do the childless...|$|E
40|$|Infrastructure {{comprises}} the physical facilities, institutions and organisational structures or {{the social and}} economic foundations for the operation of a society (UNCTAD, 2008). The World Bank (1994) defines infrastructure in physical and economic terms as public utilities (power, telecommunications, piped water supply, sanitation and sewerage, solid waste collection and disposal and piped gas), public works (roads and major dam and canal works for irrigation and drainage) and transport facilities (urban and <b>inter-urban</b> railways, urban <b>transport,</b> ports and waterways, and airports). Whilst the 'public' tag may no longer be relevant in the light of widespread private sector participation and ownership, one can agree with the examples of infrastructure projects cited in the definition above. UNCTAD (2008) provides a similar list with a caveat that this is changing with the growth of information communication technology (ICT). Many authors such as Prud-homme (2004) and Kessides (1993) also define infrastructure projects in similar terms as the World Bank report. In Ghana, infrastructure has been defined to include 'immovable capital such as, roads, power plants, water delivery systems, sewerage treatment plants, telecommunication and transport facilities, electrification, hospitals and schools' (World Bank, 1997, p. 2). All these facilities share common characteristics (UNCTAD, 2008). Firstly, they are capital-intensive. They are 'formidable undertakings' (p. 88) involving huge financial outlay. Secondly, they often involve physical networks of strategic importance. Thirdly, they are also major determinants of the competitiveness of an economy; good infrastructure can {{play a major role in}} the decision of an investor to set up in a particular economy. Fourthly, in many societies, services associated with infrastructure are thorny social and political issues and, thus, subject to public interventions. Finally, infrastructure projects are relevant to economic development and global integration...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{has had to}} be {{innovative}} and to develop and adapt technology and techniques to meet its specific needs. With a small population and a large land mass, Australia has the challenge of providing access for remote communities, <b>inter-urban</b> and urban <b>transport</b> under {{a wide range of}} climatic conditions. Like many other countries Australia has growing traffic congestion and very significant demand for freight movements across the country. As a result, Australia has had to be {{innovative and}} to develop and adapt technology and techniques to meet its specific needs. Transport researchers in Australia are challenged to help provide transportation that is: •	Safe for all users. This requires research into the means of modifying driver behaviour and to provide safe roadsides and interactions between vehicles and the road or other vehicles •	Effective. The transportation system should be as effective and efficient as possible •	Environmentally and socially acceptable. This requires the transportation system to be equitable and acceptable to all communities, groups and transport users •	Affordable. The community demands value for money and not necessarily the cheapest systems Further, the research and development of transportation systems must be: •	Intelligent, using information technology, computerised control, simulation, and with a strong understanding of processes involved in managing, controlling and advising transport users •	Inclusive of all transport users (this includes the elderly the socially disadvantaged, freight and public transport users) Transport research in Australia is mainly undertaken by publicly funded institutions such as Universities, CSIRO, ARRB Group (formerly ARRB Transport Research), Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (BTRE) and the private sector either independently or in collaboration with those institutions. Two such forms of collaboration are the Australian Research Council (ARC) program to encourage university-industry joint research effort and Co-operative Research Centres (CRCs). CRCs bring together researchers from universities, CSIRO and other government laboratories and private industry. They have been initiated by government to stimulate long-term, collaborative research and development efforts. Government provides significant funding to enable collaborative research to be of very substantial quality and size to ensure that the collaborative research undertaken by CRCs contribute to national objectives. CRCs support strong collaborative links between researchers, industry and other research users. This significantly increases the benefits of the research. CRCs also stimulate education and training through the involvement of people from outside the university system in education programs. As highlighted in the case study, the CRC for Railway Technologies and Materials is an example of such collaboration in the rail sector. Following this introductory section this Chapter briefly covers the following topics: •	Main research focus of some of the major centres undertaking research at Australia Universities, ARRB Group, CSIRO and BTRE •	Examples of current research projects being funded by the ARC through its program of ARC Discovery (basic research) and ARC Linkage grants...|$|R
40|$|This {{workshop}} {{considered the}} wider public policy goals {{of a range}} of transport interventions. Particular attention was paid to assessing the role of integration of the different components of the transport system and of the integration of transport with other economic sectors. This assessment was informed by Ray Pawson’s realist evaluation approach, with its emphasis on the inter-relationships between context, process and outcome. The context was provided by case studies covering small urban areas, large urban areas and inter-urban corridors. The three key processes identified related to a regulated system with public ownership and control, a deregulated system with private sector ownership (‘competition in the market’) and a system in which there was public planning of the transport system but private provision (‘competition for the market’). Outcomes can be assessed using cost-benefit analysis tools to determine impacts on economic welfare or more qualitative approaches can be used {{to determine the extent to}} which accessibility or sustainability goals have been achieved. The evidence provided suggests that wider public policy goals are more important for urban than for <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> and it thus in urban areas where integration should be pursued with most vigour. The most relevant process for achieving this would seem to be variants of the competition for the market model. Some policy recommendations are made and implications for further research and for future conferences assessed. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Public express coach {{services}} potentially offer {{a solution}} to many <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport</b> problems, providing additional capacity at a comparatively low financial and environmental cost, and deliverable in a much quicker timescale than the alternatives. Nonetheless, while a number of express coach schemes were recommended in the multi-modal studies commissioned in the early 2000 s, none of the schemes has been implemented. The paper adopts a sociotechnical transition perspective in examining how the potentially transformative impact of a revitalised role for the coach has failed to overcome the dominant stability of the regimes of the private road and public rail alternatives. The paper examines express coach schemes recommended in the period 1997 - 2010. To this end the discourse around ‘nascent’ coach policy {{in the early years}} of the Labour government at the national and regional levels is analysed, exploring the differing perspectives of decision makers, practitioners, current and potential users, and transport industry interests, notably, the dominant national operator (National Express) and newer entrepreneurial entrants. A negative perception amongst politicians of coach services and how they may be viewed by voters is identified as an influential reason for investment in express coach services having been discounted. From an industry perspective, a business focus on the existing key markets of student and older travellers is observed. The coach sector is also found to suffer from policy laissez-faire (beyond responses to occasional safety ‘crises’), evidenced, inter alia, by the near-absence of national monitoring data and weak inclusion within policy making arenas. Nonetheless, the paper concludes by examining case studies of successful services and possible disruptive innovations in the coach market to re-assert the potential of express coaches, and summarises the conditions under which development of the express coach niche might occur...|$|E
40|$|Demand {{responsive}} transport (DRT), such as shared mini busses, {{have become}} a viable form of public transport mainly in rural areas in recent years. In contrast to ordinary schedule-based services, DRT systems come in many different shapes and forms and are usually customised to the environment they operate in. E. g., they might be restricted to certain user groups or only operate in specific areas or with a specific fixed terminus. With advances in information and communications technology (ICT) {{and the possibility of}} driverless operations in the future, DRT systems may become an attractive additional mode also in urban and <b>inter-urban</b> <b>transport.</b> This brings the necessity to assess and evaluate DRT services and possible business models, with transport simulations being one possible way. This study introduces a framework for an extensible, open source shared minibus service simulation. Based on the agent based transport simulation MATSim and its existing DVRP extension, the extension provides DRT services as an additional mode to the synthetic population of a MATSim scenario. The module allows assigning vehicles to groups according to different dispatch algorithms shaped to the actual use case. In a first case study, a DRT system complements ordinary public transport and car infrastructure on the heavily used commuter relation between Braunschweig and Wolfsburg. During peak times, average travel times per traveler over all modes between the two cities can be reduced by 5 minutes using a fleet of 50 8 -seat-vehicles. In a second case study, a DRT system is used to shuttle passengers in an area with non-optimal public transport access to the train station in Braunschweig. With given capacity constraints, the optimizer has to decide which customers to serve in order to achieve an on-time arrival for passenger...|$|E
