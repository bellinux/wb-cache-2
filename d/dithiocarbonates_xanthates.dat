40|$|AbstractTheoretical {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} the thermal decomposition of ethyl <b>dithiocarbonates</b> (<b>xanthate)</b> using Hartree–Fock at the HF/ 321 -G* level and the density functional method with Becke 3 Lee Yang pair DFT/(B 3 LYP), 6 - 31 G*, 6 - 31 G**, 6 - 31 +G*, MP 2 and CCSD in the ab initio method of calculation using Spartan 10. Geometric parameters, such as the bond length, bond angles, dihedral angles, heat of formation, atomic charges and vibrational frequencies, were obtained. The data were used to calculate the thermodynamics parameters, change in entropy ΔS, enthalpy change ΔH, free energy G, pre-exponential factor A, rate k at 623 K, and variation of rate k with temperatures from 498 – 623 K at temperature intervals of 25 K. It was observed that the values obtained are in good agreement with the experimental values for the ab initio methods, and according to Arrhenius theory, the calculated rate k increases with increasing temperature...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dithiocarbonates</b> (<b>xanthates)</b> {{have been}} the most widely used {{collectors}} in sulphide mineral flotation. More recently, research has resulted in the use of trithiocarbonate (TTC) collectors. The present study focuses on the effect of mixtures of C 12 trithiocarbonate (C 12 TTC) and sodium iso-butyl xanthate (SIBX) in the flotation of auriferous pyrite and the associated gold and uranium from cyanidation tailings. Improved gold and uranium flotation responses were observed with collector mixtures than with SIBX alone. Sulphur recoveries were not affected. Mineralogical analysis of flotation concentrates showed that gold and uranium were also hosted by kerogen. It was therefore proposed that the improved recoveries could have been mostly due to higher kerogen recovery rather than synergism in pyrite flotation. This mechanism opens possibilities into maximising uranium recoveries in auriferous flotation circuits where low recoveries are common...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{deals with}} the various radical {{reactions}} involving <b>dithiocarbonates</b> (<b>xanthates)</b> and related structures. It will revolve around two main topics: (i) cleavage of the CO bond and (ii) cleavage of the CS bond. The first mode corresponds to the Barton-McCombie reaction and variants thereof. The mechanism of this important reaction is discussed in detail and then illustrated with a few varied examples taken from the recent literature (in order not to overlap too much with existing reviews). Modifications not using organotin hydrides are also described, with emphasis on the practical aspects. The incorporation of the Barton-McCombie process in various CC bond-forming radical sequences is also be presented. Included in this part is an O → S radical chain rearrangement that is sometimes observed. The second mode encompasses the degenerative fragmentation of xanthates. Radicals generated this way have a relatively long lifetime in the medium, allowing various transformations otherwise difficult to perform. Intermolecular additions to unactivated olefins are one such case. The possibility of using the adduct, itself a xanthate, for another radical sequence can also be exploited. Intra- and intermolecular additions to aromatic and heteroaromatic rings, as well as radical-based modifications of the xanthate group, are other possibilities that are described and illustrated with example...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} of flotation reagents with metal and mineral surfaces {{have been studied}} with electrochemistry and Raman spectroscopy. Flotation reagents are used to selectively recover valuable minerals (typically particles about 10 microns in diameter) and to suppress the froth flotation of unwanted components by altering the hydrophobicity of the mineral surface. They {{are added to the}} mineral processing circuit and are pre-sent throughout the processing system. The predominant collectors used in the froth flotation proc-ess for sulfide minerals are alkyl <b>dithiocarbonates</b> (<b>xanthates</b> ROCS 2) and similar thio compounds. The reagents adsorb onto mineral surfaces at sub-monolayer levels and can be “tailored ” by altering the R group. Xanthate-mineral interaction occurs by an electrochemical mechanism in which the anodic oxidation of the collector is coupled with the reduction of oxygen at the mineral surface. It has been shown electrochemically [1] that anodic oxidation of xanthate can result in chemisorption of a xanthate radical, and/or dimerization to form dixanthogen. SERS has enabled collection of direct chemical evidence of reagent interaction with copper, silver and gold surfaces under potential control. This data is directly comparable to the behavior of mineral particles in the flotation process, where the surface potential is controlled by a combination of oxygen concentra...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been performed on the interaction of <b>dithiocarbonates</b> (<b>xanthate)</b> {{with a wide variety}} of substrates. This study the focuses on the interaction of trithiocarbonates (TTC) with pyrite and copper. The mechanism of adsorption of the xanthate is compared to that of the TTC. For the xanthate to adsorb it is necessary for an oxidant to be present, since xanthate adsorbs via charge transfer processes (electrochemical processes). It was found by the use of cyclic voltammetry and contact angle measurements that collector adsorption of the TTC can occur in both oxidising and reducing (thus the absence of an oxidant) conditions. Neither the TTC monomer nor the dimer could be detected on the surface by the use of Raman spectroscopy. The collector species on the surface was the TTC decomposition products namely the thiol or thiolate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed that the TTC can interact under oxidising and reducing conditions. EIS showed that the rate of adsorption of the collector species for anodic currents increases relatively to the rate of adsorption for cathodic currents. Different adsorption mechanisms are realised for the different polarisation conditions. It is postulated that the TTC species serves as an intermediate for the adsorption of the thiol or thiolate on the surface, ultimately rendering the surface hydrophobic. Decomposition tests, performed by employing UV/Vis spectroscopy, indicated that the TTC is very unstable between a pH of 4 and 11. The thiol or thiolate however does not readily adsorb onto the substrates (indicated by the EIS measurements). Microflotation tests confirmed the thiolate’s inability to render pyrite hydrophobic. The microflotation tests also indicated that the TTC became less effective in recovering pyrite after it was left to decompose for a couple of hours.
