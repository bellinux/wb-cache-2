50|$|This {{butterfly}} seldom visits flowers, {{but rather}} feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, salts and minerals from puddling, and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 56-70 mm. The upperside is {{brown with}} dark eyespots at the margins. The underside is light brown. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 59-70 mm. Males have spotted forewings. The upperside is {{brown with}} patches of dark scales along the veins. The underside is tan for {{both males and}} females. Adults feed on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, carrion and dung.|$|R
50|$|Their mother, Hamadryas, is immortalized in {{the name}} of two genera: that of the cracker {{butterfly}}, and that of the northernmost monkey in Asia Minor, the hamadryas baboon. The cracker butterfly is more arboreal than most butterflies, as it commonly camouflages itself on trees. It feeds on <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit and dung. The hamadryas baboon is one of the least arboreal monkeys, but was the most common monkey in Hellenic lands.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree <b>sap,</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 32-38 mm. The upperside is brown without markings. The underside is also brown, {{but with}} small eyespots rimmed with yellow on both wings. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|An adult has a {{wingspan}} {{of up to}} 8 centimeters. The larva is a {{dark gray}} mottled caterpillar with thick pink-tinted legs and a jumping ability. The adults feed on nectar, <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit, while the larvae prefer the foliage of several oak species.|$|R
50|$|Larval Diptera feed in leaf-litter, in leaves, stems, roots, {{flower and}} seed heads of plants, moss, fungi, rotting wood, rotting fruit or other organic matter such as slime, flowing <b>sap,</b> and <b>rotting</b> cacti, carrion, dung, {{detritus}} in mammal bird or wasp nests, fine organic material including insect frass and micro-organisms. Many Diptera larvae are predatory, sometimes on the larvae of other Diptera.|$|R
30|$|The fungus was {{observed}} to cause stem rot on Sawara cypress Chamaecyparis pisifera (Sieb. & Zucc.) Endl. (Fig.  1 C, D) and Hinoki cypress Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. & Zucc. (Fig.  1 E, F). Imazeki [4] called this disease “Hi-akagare-sei-mizogusare-byo” in Japanese, stem <b>sap</b> <b>rot.</b> Aoshima et al. [5] identified the causal fungus as Fomitiporia punctata (Fr.) Murrill (Phellinus punctatus) and named the fungus from Chiba Prefecture, Japan “Cha-ana-take-modoki” in Japanese. Recently, Hattori et al. [7, 8] morphologically and phylogenetically analyzed the preserved fruiting body and mycelia of this fungus, {{and reported that}} the causal organism was distinct from F. punctata [9 – 11] and was another species of the genus Fomitiporia. Ota et al. [12, 13] reported that the isolated fungus from C. japonica and that from stem rot of C. pisifera form a phylogenetically distinct clade from F. punctata, and discussed that the pathogens on these tree species were possibly conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 70-86 mm. The upperside is mottled {{brown and}} white {{although there is}} some red in the forewing cell bar. The hindwing eyespots have orange scales preceding black crescents. The underside of the hindwings is white and the submarginal eyespots are composed of a brown ring around a black crescent in a white center. Adults are on wing year round in the tropics and from August to October in southern Texas. They feed on <b>sap</b> and <b>rotting</b> fruit.|$|R
50|$|The {{larval food}} is the foliage of certain native and {{introduced}} tree species. The native species include wattles, Illawarra flame-tree, lacebark or white kurrajong, kurrajong and Celtis species, while the black locust or false acacia is an exotic species {{that is also}} favoured. Adults may feed on the <b>sap</b> of trees, <b>rotting</b> fruit and moisture from dung.|$|R
50|$|Brachyopa insensilis is {{arboreal}} descending {{to visit}} sap runs and flowers (white umbellifers, Photinia, Prunus padus, Sorbus aria The flight period {{is from the}} beginning of May to the end of June.Brachyopa insensilis has a characteristic, rapid, zigzag flight and rarely descends lower than 3 metres from the ground. It may occur in small swarms around sap runs.Larvae feed in <b>sap</b> runs and <b>rot</b> holes.|$|R

It will be a strange sort of book, tho', I fear; blubber is blubber you know; tho' you may get oil out of it, the poetry runs as <b>hard</b> as <b>sap</b> from a frozen maple tree; — & to cook the thing up, one must needs throw in a little fancy, which from {{the nature of the}} thing, must be ungainly as the gambols of the whales themselves. Yet I mean to give the truth of the thing, spite of this.|$|R
50|$|They are trees, shrubs or lianas, {{which may}} be armed or unarmed. Where they have spines, these are {{modified}} stipules. In some, prickles arise from the stem's cortex and epidermis. The leaves are bipinnate or are modified to vertically oriented phyllodes. A few have cladodes rather than leaves. Extrafloral nectaries may be present on the petiole and rachis, and the pinnule tips may carry protein-lipid Beltian bodies. The leaflets are usually opposite, and are carried on shortly stalks or are sessile. The heartwood is typically red and <b>hard,</b> and the <b>sap</b> of various species hardens into gum.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{database}} management systems {{are designed for}} optimizing performance on hardware with constrained main memory. Disk I/O was the main bottleneck. The focus was on optimizing disk access, where by minimizing the number of disk pages to be read into main memory during processing. The SAP HANA database is designed {{from the ground up}} around the idea that memory is available in abundance. Instead of optimizing I/O <b>hard</b> disk access, <b>SAP</b> HANA optimizes memory access between the CPU cache and main memory. SAP HANA is a massively parallel (distributed) data management system that runs fully in main memory, allowing for row- and column based storage options, and supporting built-in multitenancy.

60|$|Festing, however, {{would wait}} for nothing, and Kerr and Norton were equally resolute. Just now Festing was {{clearing}} away the snow while three or four men cautiously descended the bank, dragging loads of branches. A big fire was soon lighted, and when the resinous wood broke into snapping flame Festing cleared a spot farther on for another. By and by he scattered the first, the thawed surface was pierced, and a hole dug. Then with half an hour's savage labor they got the first big post on end. The next broke the supporting tackle and a man narrowly escaped when it fell, but they raised it again and got to work upon the braces. The wood was unseasoned and <b>hard</b> with frozen <b>sap.</b> Saw and auger would scarcely bite, but somehow they cut the notches and bored the holes. When the first frame was roughly stayed Charnock sat down with a breathless laugh.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study how an {{automatic}} ERP system is used by a purchase department of after-sales products between a supplier and a customer within a supply chain. It will cover {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the ERP system and also investigate the possibility to for an ERP system to independently manage the purchase process. To be able to connect this to the real world we interviewed the staff at a purchasing department on a multinational corporation. In the study we have found that there are differences between theory and practice when it comes to implementing an SAP system. There are both advantages and disadvantages in theory as well as in reality. We found that most important advantages perceived by ABB Robotics is that it is an integrated system which facilitates the information flow and gives a quick response to the customers. The integration also leads to a simple order processing, something that was seen as an advantage by purchasers at ABB Robotics. On the other hand we found that the main disadvantages was that it is <b>hard</b> to integrate <b>SAP</b> with other systems, it is costly to implement SAP functions in a purchase department and for the moment impossible to integrate with customers outside of SAP.
