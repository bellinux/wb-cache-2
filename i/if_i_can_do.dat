5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{answer was}} humorous. [...] "I am a soldier. I am on duty. I'm {{not at all}} sure that I shall have a moment's leave; but <b>I</b> will call <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|Hillcrist, ye've got me {{beaten and}} disgraced hereabouts, ye've {{destroyed}} my son's married life, and ye've killed my grandchild. I'm not staying in this cursed spot, but <b>if</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> you or yours a hurt, I will.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see how matters stand, beloved. Either I must {{surrender}} myself, or {{all these}} brave men must perish, and we with them. For myself, I {{am ready to}} die, but I am not willing that you and they should die. Also, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> yield, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> no worse than die, whereas perchance after all things will take another turn. Now what say you?" ...|$|R
500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I just think that's gross." [...] On being a young role model to kids, Song said: [...] "Oh goodness, I hope I can set a good example. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, anyone can. I'm living my dream every single day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, Cuban {{partnered with}} Mascot Books to publish his first children's book, Let's Go, Mavs!.

2500|$|On December 14, 2016, Duterte gave {{a speech}} to {{business}} leaders in the presidential palace where he spoke of personally killing suspected criminals as Mayor of Davao {{to set an example}} for local police. He said, [...] "In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it why can't you. And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble also." ...|$|E
2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in my nature. I have no ulterior motives. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone. The trouble I'm put to is not so great that I have to refuse people in need... Very often warm-heartedness will win a man gratitude and friendship, and then the time comes to ask for one thing or another in... Folks come and ask how they should vote because they feel the need for advice. They want to show that they are grateful to those who have worked for their good; they want to thank them for what they've done by voting for them; but they are ignorant, and want to be told how to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's brave! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> any thing, let me know; I {{shall be}} most happy." [...] And Mr. Fletcher evidently meant what he said.|$|E
