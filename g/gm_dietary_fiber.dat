40|$|There {{have been}} many reports {{concerning}} the role of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> in lowering postprandial serum glucose, and the main mechanism was regarded as the viscosity of different <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> ih hampering diffusion of glucose and postponing absorption and digestion of carbohydrates. In this paper, two kinds of water-insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers,</b> water-insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> of wheat bran and enzyme-resistant starch of maize amylose, and four kinds of water-soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers,</b> water-soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> of wheat bran, carboxymethyl cellulose, guar gum, and xanthan gum, were used to investigate their postprandial serum glucose lowering mechanism in vitro. The results showed that these <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> lowered postprandial serum glucose levels at least by three mechanisms. First, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> increase the viscosity of small intestine juice and hinder diffusion of glucose; second, they bind glucose and decrease the concentration of available glucose in the small intestine; and, third, they retard α-amylase action through capsuling starch and the enzyme and might directly inhibit the enzyme.

Forty-three percent of the <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> intake comes from grains and predominantly grain mixtures while 27. 5 % comes from vegetables; 10. 1 % comes from fruits and 7. 2 % comes from legumes, nuts and seeds. The <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> data used in the USDA's surveys are generated by the method, AOAC 985. 29, an enzymatic-gravimetric method of analysis.

In this investigation both quantitative and microstructural changes in common bean <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> as a result of cooking were examined. Cooking resulted in a slight decrease in soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> and a marked increase in insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber.</b> The increase in insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> was responsible for a 15 - 30 percent increase in total <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber.</b> Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the microstructure of uncooked and cooked bean flours and the insoluble and soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> fractions of these two fl ours.

40|$|Pasta is a {{traditional}} food that is favored by consumers for its ease of handling, storing, and cooking. Pasta is a low fat product with no cholesterol content and low glycaemic index. Since pasta is widely consumed, incorporating <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> into pasta is a promising way of producing functional foods that combine both nutritional values of pasta and health benefits of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber.</b> However, <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> has shown a blocking effect on mineral absorption. The mechanism of this potential binding effect particularly in pasta has not been well studied. This uncertainty might jeopardize the utilization and application of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> in new product development, and also the fiber-enriched pasta developed could possibly affect mineral bioaccessibility.

Design: In order to assess the relative validity of the FFQ, a total of 125 participants completed both a 7 -day weighed dietary recording (DR) and an FFQ consisting of 60 questions.

Pearson's correlation coefficient between the estimated <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> intake of the two methods was r= 0. 63 (p< 0. 001), and 62 % of the participants were grouped into the same tertile of intake according to the two methods.

A good linear correlation was found between both methods. Compared to the more accurate <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> method, the detergent fiber method overestimates the content of cellulose, whereas the detergent fiber method, {{as compared to the}} <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> method, overestimates and underestimates the hemicellulose content in commelinid and non-commelinid magnoliophyta biomass, respectively. Because of the good linear correlations, conversion factors were determined to predict the cellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan contents to be expected from the <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> method,on the basis of analyses made by the faster, cheaper, and more commonly practiced detergent fiber method. Nevertheless, the <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> method offers the advantage of providing the detailed composition of the hemicelluloses (xylan, arabinan,hemicellulosic glucan, galactan, and mannan), and that is of interest for biorefining purposes...|$|R
5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber,</b> 1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, {{with smaller}} proportions of hemicellulose, lignin and starch. Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose and fructose.|$|R
40|$|Some {{properties}} {{of a high}} <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> powder prepared from pineapple fruit shell were evaluated and compared to those of several commercial fruit <b>fibers.</b> Total <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> (TDF) content (70. 6 %) was similar to some commercial <b>dietary</b> <b>fibers</b> from apple and citrus fruits; however, its sensory properties (neutral color and flavor) were better than those from commercial fibers above mentioned. The insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> fraction amounted to 99 % of the TDF. Major neutral sugars in soluble and insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> were, respectively, xylose (36 % of total sugar) and glucose (43 % of total sugar). Total uronic acids (5. 1 %) and Klason lignin (11. 2 %) were also measured. Antioxidant activity (AA), a new property derived from the bioactive compounds associated with <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber,</b> was evaluated. At the concentration of 0. 5 g of powdered sample/ 100 mL in the assay mixture, pineapple fiber showed a higher AA (86. 7 %) than orange peel fiber (34. 6 %), while commercial lemon and apple fibers did not exhibit any activity. Myricetin was the major polyphenol identified in pineapple fiber, which could {{be responsible for the}} AA shown. The AA together with its sensory properties, which would not interfere with those from the food to be added, make pineapple shell a suitable source of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The health {{benefits}} of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> {{in the general population}} are increasingly recognized. Krishnamurthy et al. provide compelling evidence that chronic kidney disease (CKD) further augments these benefits. CKD, besides a microinflammatory state, is a state of increased proteolytic fermentation. Both these harmful conditions are exacerbated by dietary protein and reversed by <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber.</b> Future nutrition guidelines should consider recommending a higher consumption of <b>dietary</b> <b>fiber</b> or potassium-free alternatives such as prebiotics in CKD patients. status: publishe...|$|R
