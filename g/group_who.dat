5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral.

Dairy farmers are another <b>group</b> <b>who</b> complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems.
