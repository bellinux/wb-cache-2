500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to make it sound like your garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till he literally was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ We were like, ‘we think <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, Connan Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E

But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

50|$|This is {{the first}} time Abhay Deol has sung for a film, though both Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan made their singing debuts for Rock On!! and Kites respectively.

500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason I can think of {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not even close to being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E
2500|$|Pundits accused Dole {{of being}} a [...] "flip-flopper and a hypocrite." [...] Editorials ran in major newspapers, {{including}} The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Times of London, condemning Dole's action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus. [...] Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. [...] "I think if they'd have consulted me, we wouldn't have done that, wouldn't have returned it," [...] Dole said. Dole later told Washington Post editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a [...] "mistake" [...] because the decision to return the check [...] "gets into Bob Dole the person. [...] It's {{not so much about}} Bob Dole the candidate. It's the person. [...] Is he tolerant? [...] Does he tolerate different views? [...] Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?" [...] He added, [...] "This is basic, this is what people ought to know about you. [...] Are you going to just do this because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good</b> politically?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Santorum {{has written}} for Catholic {{publications}} and frequently comments on political issues from a religious standpoint. He has said, [...] "I don't believe in an America where {{the separation of church}} and state is absolute. The First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square." [...] In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter, Santorum said that the distinction between private religious conviction and public responsibility, espoused by President John F. Kennedy, had caused [...] "great harm in America". He said: [...] "All of us have heard people say, 'I privately am against abortion, homosexual marriage, stem cell research, cloning. But who am I to decide that it's not right for somebody else?' <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good,</b> but it is the corruption of freedom of conscience." [...] Santorum has been criticized for not separating his politics from his personal faith, and has been accused of advancing a [...] "Christian theocracy" [...] through his work. He told a group of college students in 2008 that the United States had been founded on [...] "Judeo-Christian" [...] ethics, and now [...] "it is a shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>good.</b> I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E

5000|$|Though {{the song}} {{has long been}} termed a [...] "working class anthem", George Young {{maintained}} it had [...] "more {{to do with their}} outlook on the world than any class statement".

5000|$|He {{also offers}} a glimpse into his {{approach}} to writing and revision.

5000|$|I {{get this}} {{question}} all the time, because Blish's 1958 {{story is about}} a Spanish Jesuit in space.

In fact, Emilio got his name from the pharmaceutical manufacturer who made my son's cold medicine. Danny got a cold in 1992 when I started the book, and I noticed the name Sandoz on the medicine label and thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>good.</b> No symbolism or homage beyond that, I'm afraid! ...|$|R
