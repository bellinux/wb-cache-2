2500|$|Berberine is a {{quaternary}} ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. [...] It {{is found in}} such plants as Berberis (e.g. Berberis vulgaris (barberry), Berberis aristata (tree turmeric)), Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape), Hydrastis canadensis (<b>goldenseal),</b> Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot), Phellodendron amurense (Amur cork tree), Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread), Tinospora cordifolia, Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy), and Eschscholzia californica (Californian poppy). Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark.|$|E
50|$|Taking <b>goldenseal</b> over a {{long period}} of time can reduce {{absorption}} of B vitamins. Avoid <b>goldenseal</b> during pregnancy and lactation, with gastrointestinal inflammation, and with pro-inflammatory disorders. A recent study (2011) found rats fed with <b>Goldenseal</b> constantly for two years had a greater tendency towards tumor formation.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{currently}} insufficient evidence {{to determine whether}} <b>goldenseal</b> is effective for any conditions. According to the American Cancer Society, [...] "evidence does not support claims that <b>goldenseal</b> is effective in treating cancer or other diseases. <b>Goldenseal</b> can have toxic side effects, and high doses can cause death." ...|$|E
50|$|In herbal medicine, <b>goldenseal</b> {{is used as}} a {{multi-purpose}} remedy; however, {{there is}} little scientific evidence it works. <b>Goldenseal</b> has the following purported uses: control muscle spasms, treat cancer, stimulate the heart and increase blood pressure, treat gastrointestinal disorders, treat conjunctivitis, manage painful and heavy menstruation, treat infections topically, reduce swelling and edema. <b>Goldenseal</b> may be purchased in salve, tablet, tincture form, or as a bulk powder. <b>Goldenseal</b> is often used to boost the medicinal effects of other herbs with which it is blended or formulated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Goldenseal</b> {{became popular}} in the mid-nineteenth century. By 1905, the herb was much less plentiful, {{partially}} due to overharvesting and partially to habitat destruction. Wild <b>goldenseal</b> is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which by definition means harvest from public land is prohibited and may require a permit to export, although trade of the plants is still deemed to be undetrimental to the wildlife population and is otherwise unregulated. More than 60 million <b>goldenseal</b> plants are picked each year without being replaced. [...] The process of mountain top removal mining has recently put the wild <b>goldenseal</b> population at major risk due to loss of habitat, illegality of removing <b>goldenseal</b> for transplant without registration while destruction {{in the process of}} removing the mountain top is permitted, and increased economic pressure on stands outside of the removal area.|$|E
50|$|Two {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} no effect of oral <b>goldenseal</b> on urine drug assays over water alone. Subjects who drank large amounts of water had the same urine drug levels as subjects who took <b>goldenseal</b> capsules along with the water.|$|E

50|$|While <b>goldenseal,</b> {{like all}} alkaloid-rich herbs {{including}} coffee and tobacco {{should be avoided}} during pregnancy and given to very young children with care, it appears that <b>goldenseal</b> {{is unlikely to be}} toxic in normal doses. Interactions with drugs with narrow therapeutic windows like warfarin, ciclosporin, protease inhibitors and cardiac glycosides are potential concerns.|$|E
50|$|California {{is proposing}} to list <b>goldenseal</b> root powder as a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Herbalist Paul Bergner {{investigated}} {{the research and}} {{has been unable to}} find case reports where the level of intestinal pathogens are lower after taking <b>goldenseal.</b> In fact, a study by Rabbani where men with E. coli induced diarrhea who had 42-48% reduced symptoms after taking berberine showed unchanged levels of intestinal bacteria, pathogenic or otherwise after taking <b>goldenseal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Herbalists today {{consider}} <b>goldenseal</b> an alternative, anti-catarrhal, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, astringent, bitter tonic, laxative, anti-diabetic {{and muscular}} stimulant. They discuss the astringent effect {{it has on}} mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder, and rectum (applied topically), and the skin. <b>Goldenseal</b> is very bitter, which stimulates the appetite and aids digestion, and often stimulates bile secretion.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into the}} {{toxicology}} and pharmacology of <b>goldenseal</b> {{has focused on}} berberine and hydrastine, which are antimicrobial, chloretic and each {{have a variety of}} other properties helping immunity. But toxicity in a concentrated constituent does not translate to toxicity of the whole herb, which contains many other compounds. In one study, the lethal dose (LD50) for rats was 12 times lower with hydrastine than with <b>goldenseal</b> extract.|$|E

50|$|<b>Goldenseal</b> {{became a}} part of American {{folklore}} associated with chemical testing errors, from pharmacist John Uri Lloyd's 1900 novel Stringtown on the Pike. In the book, the victim's habit of taking <b>goldenseal</b> in the form of digestive bitters, causes this herb to appear as the poison strychnine in a chemical test - thus suggesting murder. It has been used on occasions in this century to attempt to mask the use of morphine in race horses (without success).|$|E

50|$|Many {{herbalists}} urge {{caution in}} choosing products containing <b>goldenseal,</b> {{as they may}} have been harvested in an unsustainable manner as opposed to having been organically cultivated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goldenseal</b> {{contains}} the isoquinoline alkaloids: hydrastine, berberine, berberastine, hydrastinine, tetrahydroberberastine, canadine, and canalidine. A related compound, 8-oxotetrahydrothalifendine was identified in one study. One study analyzed the hydrastine and berberine contents of twenty commercial <b>goldenseal</b> and goldenseal-containing products and found they contained variously 0%-2.93% hydrastine and 0.82%-5.86% berberine. Berberine and hydrastine act as quaternary bases and are poorly {{soluble in water}} but freely soluble in alcohol. The herb seems to have synergistic antibacterial activity over berberine in vitro, possibly due to efflux pump inhibitory activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goldenseal</b> {{has been}} found to have {{inhibited}} cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 activity by approximately 40%, a statistically and clinically significant reduction. CYP2D6 specifically is a known metabolizer of many commonly used pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants (including all SSRIs except for fluvoxamine), neuroleptics, and codeine. Combining <b>Goldenseal</b> with such medications should be done with caution and under the supervision of a doctor as it can lead to serious - perhaps fatal - toxicity. Those with a genetic deficiency in these enzymes are at particular risk.|$|E
5000|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>goldenseal</b> may include [...] "digestive complaints, nervousness, depression, constipation, rapid heartbeat, diarrhea, stomach cramps and pain, mouth ulcers, nausea, seizures, vomiting, and {{central nervous system}} depression. High doses may cause {{breathing}} problems, paralysis, and even death. Long-term use may lead to vitamin B deficiency, hallucinations, and delirium." [...] In addition, <b>goldenseal</b> may cause brain damage to newborn babies if given to them directly or if taken by their breastfeeding or pregnant mothers, and may affect blood pressure unpredictably because it contains several different compounds that have opposite effects on blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|It appears {{likely that}} <b>goldenseal</b> shares with Mahonia (Oregon grape) and Berberis (Barberry) {{the ability to}} inhibit the drug {{resistance}} efflux pumps (MDR pumps) of bacteria, as discussed below.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the European {{colonization}} of the Americas, <b>goldenseal</b> was in extensive use among certain Native American tribes of North America, both as a medicine and as a coloring material. Benjamin Smith Barton in his first edition of Collections for an Essay Toward a Materia Medica of the United States (1798), refers to the Cherokee use of <b>goldenseal</b> as a cancer treatment. Later, he calls attention to its properties as a bitter tonic, and as a local wash for ophthalmia. It became a favorite of the Eclectics from {{the time of}} Constantine Raffinesque in the 1830s.|$|E

5000|$|Under the {{guidelines}} of California Proposition 65, orally ingested non-decolorized aloe vera leaf extract has been listed by the OEHHA, along with <b>goldenseal,</b> among [...] "chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity".|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{research}} that is popularly attributed to <b>goldenseal</b> has actually been into the constituent berberine, which <b>goldenseal</b> has in common {{with a variety of}} other plants including oregon-grape, Coptis, Phellodendron, barberry (Berberis vulgaris), and yellowroot (Xanthorhiza simplicissima). However, constituents frequently act differently in isolation than a whole herb acts in the body. In 1996, the committee of the European Union that regulates drugs placed barberry in a table of Herbal Drugs with Serious Risks without any Accepted Benefit because it contains berberine. Paul Bergner investigated the literature and was able to find only a single report of potential adverse effects of berberis species, berberine-containing plants, or berberine itself in a computer search of the MEDLINE and TOXLINE databases of the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This was a study in China that showed that berberine sulfate is inappropriate for the treatment of newborn infants with prenatal jaundice. However that is not a likely scenario in a country where babies born jaundiced are hospitalized, but it does lend credence to the traditional advice not to take <b>goldenseal</b> or other berberine herbs during pregnancy.|$|E
