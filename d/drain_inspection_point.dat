40|$|Analyzing {{inspection}} data is {{an important}} activity in the geometry assurance process, which provides vital information about product and process performance. Since inspection is related to a significant cost, it is desirable with an intelligent inspection preparation where the motive is to gather {{as much information as}} possible about the product and the process with a minimum number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points.</b> In many situations, a large number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are used despite the fact that only a small subset of points is needed. The reason for this redundancy is that most systems have only a few principal causes affecting groups of variables. In this paper, we use methods of cluster analysis to find these natural groupings of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> and to select one representing point from each cluster. Furthermore, if the relationship between some of the process parameters and <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are known from experiments or from computer simulations, then the cluster analy sis is combined with sensitivity-based reduction. In this way, an efficient reduced inspection plan is built up. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology for reduction is verified on an industrial case study and by computer simulations...|$|R

The ideal <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> are known; however, the panel may be relocated due to inaccurate parking and warpage. A method of determining the mathematical description of a translated as well as a warped surface by accurate measurement of only a few points on this surface is developed here. The method uses a linear warp model whose effect is superimposed on the rigid body translation. Due to the angles involved, small angle approximations are possible, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. Given an accurate linear warp model, all the desired translation and warp parameters can be obtained by knowledge of the ideal locations of four fiducial points and the corresponding measurements of these points on the actual radiator surface. The method uses three of the fiducials to define a plane and the fourth to define the warp. Given this information, it is possible to determine a transformation that will enable the ARID system to translate any desired <b>inspection</b> <b>point</b> on the ideal surface to its corresponding value on the actual surface...|$|R

A key aspect of the approach is {{the transformation of the}} inspection task into a colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP). This is achieved by generating a number of <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> on the medial axis of each region in order to increase visibility and by grouping the <b>inspection</b> <b>points</b> according to their color.

Manufacturers include specific inspection procedures in their maintenance handbooks.

However, it has been observed, that technical crews can complete inspection in less time than suggested by the manual, without violation of the time prescribed for each <b>inspection</b> <b>point.</b> In this work we will try to apply routing algorithms, to improve the total inspection time, by finding the optimal inspection sequence. This will be achieved without violating any constraint set by the manufacturer, except for the small reduction of the service time on some points. The algorithms we will use is the algorithmic set usually applied for the well-known PDPTW (pickup and delivery problem with time windows). Every inspection area is considered as a network G(N,A) consisting of nodes N, and arcs A. Every node (<b>Inspection</b> <b>Point)</b> is characterized by the Time Window, defined as the time interval earliest-latest [e i,l i], during which the point should be inspected. It is also characterized by the Service Time s i, defined as the time required to complete the check on this point. Every arc between two nodes describes the time c od, needed for the technician to move from the first node (Origin) to second node (Destination).
