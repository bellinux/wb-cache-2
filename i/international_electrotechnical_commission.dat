5|$|The CGS {{absolute}} unit {{of electric}} current, the abampere, had been {{defined in terms}} of the force between two parallel current-carrying wires in 1881.

5|$|In 1881 first International Electrical Congress {{adopted the}} BAAS {{recommendations}} on electrical units, {{followed by a}} series of congresses in which further units of measure were defined and the <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC) was set up with the specific task of overseeing electrical units of measure. This was followed by the International Congress of Radiology (ISR) who, at their inaugural meeting in 1926, initiated the definition of radiological-related units of measure.|$|E
40|$|In the US, {{more than}} 10, 000 {{electric}} vehicles (EV) have been delivered to consumers {{during the first}} three quarters of 2011. A large majority of these vehicles are battery electric, often requiring 220 volt charging. Though the vehicle manufacturers and charging station manufacturers have provided consumers options for charging preferences, there are no existing communications between consumers and the utilities to manage the charging demand. There is also wide variation between manufacturers in their approach to support vehicle charging. There are in-vehicle networks, charging station networks, utility networks each using either cellular, Wi-Fi, ZigBee or other proprietary communication technology with no standards currently available for interoperability. The current situation of ad-hoc solutions is a major barrier to the wide adoption of electric vehicles. SAE, the <b>International</b> Standards Organization/International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Commission</b> (ISO/IEC), ANSI, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and several industrial organizations are working towards the development of interoperability standards. PNNL has participated in the development and testing of these standards in an effort to accelerate the adoption and development of communication modules...|$|R
