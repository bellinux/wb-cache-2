5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the <b>harp</b> <b>seal</b> have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the <b>harp</b> <b>seal,</b> crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{pinnipeds}} have fur coats, {{the exception}} being the walrus, {{which is only}} sparsely covered. Even some fully furred species (particularly sea lions) are less haired than most land mammals. In species that live on ice, young pups have thicker coats than adults. The individual hairs on the coat, known collectively as lanugo, can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm. Pinnipeds are typically countershaded, and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally, which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water. The pure white fur of <b>harp</b> <b>seal</b> pups conceals them in their Arctic environment. Some species, such as ribbon seals, ringed seals and leopard seals, have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration. All fully furred species molt; phocids molt once a year, while otariids gradually molt all year. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses. Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting. It can constitute as much as 50% of a pinniped's body weight. Pups are born with only {{a thin layer of}} blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E

40|$|Surveys {{conducted}} in offshore waters of Newfoundland and Labrador (NAFO Div. 2 J and 3 KL) between 1991 and 1993 indicate that both <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca groenlandica) and hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) {{were present in}} offshore waters during the winter. Hooded seals appeared to utilize the slope edge and northern areas {{to a greater extent}} than <b>harp</b> <b>seals.</b> The waters near the border of Div. 3 K and 3 L may be an important wintering area for both species. <b>Harp</b> <b>seals</b> were particularly abundant in this area in 1992 and 1993. Groundfish hydroacoustic surveys indicate that high densities of cod were present in this area in 1992 but not 1993, suggesting that the reason for the presence of seals in the area may not be the occurrence of pre-spawning concentrations of cod, per. se. The distribution of both species shifted northward by April. The movement of <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> northward continued into July, at which time no hooded seals were present...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to hunting {{pressures on the}} population of harp seals, as ice seals that are dependent on solid sea ice for whelping, the <b>harp</b> <b>seal</b> population is affected by global climate change. The lack of sea ice {{in recent years has}} resulted in the drowning deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} newborn <b>harp</b> <b>seal</b> pups.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the European Union {{banned the}} import of whitecoat <b>harp</b> <b>seal</b> pup pelts (pelts from pups less than about two weeks of age, when the pups molt). As a result, the market for pelts dropped. The kill rates thus {{declined}} in subsequent years {{to an average of}} about 52,000 seals from 1983 to 1995.

25|$|Seal: Depending on the season, Inuit {{hunt for}} {{different}} types of seal: <b>harp</b> <b>seal,</b> harbour seal, and bearded seal. Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need {{to break through the}} ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a breath of air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Harp</b> <b>seals</b> {{prefer to}} swim in the ocean, {{spending}} relatively little time on land. These are extremely social animals {{and they can be}} very noisy, as well.

40|$|New {{findings}} are presented about {{the occurrence of}} hooded <b>seals</b> (Cystophora cristata), <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca groenlandica), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in Icelandic waters for 1989 – 94. These animals had been entangled in gill nets for lumpsuckers (Cyclopterus lumpus) and cod (Gadus morhua), shot by local hunters, or found dead on the shore. The majority of the animals were from the north coast of Iceland, during the spring and summer. The majority of the hooded seals, were pups and one-year-olds, although older ani-mals occurred frequently. Males were significantly more abundant in the catch than fe-males. Young seals, pups and one-year-olds, dominated in the catch of <b>harp</b> <b>seals.</b> Males were not significantly more abundant than females. During the period 1989 – 94, there {{seemed to have been}} an increase in the frequency of visits of hooded and <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> to Icelandic waters, and they seemed to be more numerous off the north coast than about a decade ago. However, they are probably not as numerous now as in earlier times, especially in years of heavy land-ice and polar-ice in the 18 th and 19 th century. Ringed seals were mainly caught during the spring and early summer, while most of the bearded seals were caught in winter. The majority of the bearded seals visiting the Icelandic coast were young immature animals, while the ringed seals were sub-adults and adults.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was analyse <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> prey use and {{selection}} during summer in Svalbard waters. A total of 41, 34 and 58 (including 24 faeces samples) from animals were sampled in 1996, 1997 and 2004. Krill was the overall dominant prey species (63 %) followed by polar cod (16 %) and other fish species (10 %) in terms of a combined index (frequency occurrence and weight). Resource mapping was performed in two areas simultaneous with the seal sampling, in 1996 and 1997 by using standard acoustic methods. These surveys suggested that krill was the most abundant prey in both areas and years; krill constituted 84 % and 69 % of the total prey biomass in 1996 (99. 7 tonnes/nm 2) and 1997 (21. 4 tonnes/nm 2), respectively followed by parathmisto sp.

25|$|An {{important}} {{distinction between the}} southern Canadian seal hunt and the Inuit Canadian hunt is that Canadian Inuit typically hunt ringed seals, while the southern Canadian hunt targets the pelt of the <b>harp</b> <b>seal.</b> Greenlandic Inuit hunt and eat both ringed and harp seals. Unfortunately, protests surrounding the southern seal hunt in Canada have historically damaged the financial well-being of both Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit more than it has the hunting of harp seals. Because of the strongly emotional nature of the protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of ringed seal fall with any ban on any type of seal product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, {{the year of the}} first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which threatened the survival of Inuit in many areas.

2500|$|<b>Harp</b> <b>seal</b> {{populations in}} the {{northwest}} Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s {{as a result of}} Canada's annual kill rates, which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970. Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the <b>harp</b> <b>seal.</b> An endangered seal is the Mediterranean monk seal. In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year's quota had been reached. Because it was thought that the competitive element might cause sealers to cut corners, new regulations were introduced that limited the catch to 400 seals per day, and 2000 per boat total.
