40|$|International audienceGervaise & al 2011 and Barazzutti & al 2013 {{described}} the general {{structure of a}} scheme to estimate the nature of superficial sediment in shallow waters using marine mammal's whistles and a single receiver. The multipath structure of calls given by a spectrogram is used to estimate the source characteristics and the superficial sea bottom features. A field application of this method was presented in [11] using controlled signals similar to marine mammal's vocalizations in a shallow water environment on a sandy bottom. However, contrary to the source used during that experiment, marine mammals are directive sources and the <b>directivity</b> <b>loss</b> underwent by the multipath {{must be taken into}} account in our inversion process. Indeed, the directivity is a function of frequency and emission angle (sound-source azimuth), and impacts each path differently. Thus the bottom path, once corrected from transmission loss, must be corrected from <b>directivity</b> <b>loss</b> before being used to estimate the bottom features. The emission angle can easily be geometrically related to the arrival angle and a specific unknown angle we called attitude (source orientation in space during the emission). However, the directivity patterns of marine mammals are not well studied yet, especially for vocalizations (e. g. directivity model assumption - Au 1993 [4], directivity pattern measurement - Au & al 2012 [9], etc.) and contrary to other mammals the unknown "attitude" parameter is not that easy to observe (e. g. Dantzker & al 1999). Our communication aims at describing different methods to estimate the "attitude" angle and the <b>directivity</b> <b>loss</b> for marine mammals. Their performances and limits are evaluated using simulated data...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel for acoustic research on STOL concepts has been investigated. The acoustic characteristics of the wind-tunnel test section have been studied with calibrated acoustic sources. Acoustic characteristics of several large-scale STOL models have been studied in both the free-field and wind-tunnel acoustic environments. The results of these studies indicate that the acoustic characteristics of large-scale STOL models {{can be measured in}} the wind tunnel if the test section acoustic environment and model acoustic similitude are taken into consideration. The reverberant field of the test section must be determined with an acoustically similar noise source. A directional microphone, a phased array of microphones, and extrapolation of near-field data to far-field are some of the techniques being explored as possible solutions to the <b>directivity</b> <b>loss</b> in a reverberant field.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a recently developed chart for determining the directional properties of sound emitted from the open end of a ventilation duct. When designing a duct silencer to reduce noise from a large vertical discharge duct, it is useful to note that the first 5 to 10 dBA noise reduction may result from <b>directivity</b> <b>losses</b> at 90 degrees and can be accurately predicted. In 1971 the first author conducted sound directivity tests with 300 and 600 mm diameter ducts and the results were made into a rough chart of Duct <b>Directivity</b> <b>Losses</b> that ultimately found its way into the NSW EPA Environmental Noise Control Manual (5 June 1985, page 207. 1). It is wrong in principle and rather inaccurate, but some users are unaware of its failings. Over the last 13 years further duct directivity testing has been conducted and a new duct directivity chart drawn. It is based on sound directivity testing on ducts of 305, 400, 610, 915 and 1220 mm diameter. The directivity data has been related to the sound power level of noise emitted from the duct and the spherical dispersion of sound energy. The new Duct Directivity Chart allows the <b>directivity</b> gain or <b>loss</b> to be obtained for any diameter from 100 mm to 10 metres, at angles from zero to 135 degrees without the need for complex calculations.

40|$|A {{simple and}} novel {{solution}} is proposed {{to overcome the}} main beam splitting of the tapered slot antenna (TSA) fabricated on a thick substrate with high dielectric constant. It utilised arrays of metal strip gratings to reduce the undesirable surface waves. Measured result of a 10 lambda 0 long 35 GHz linear taper slot antenna (LTSA), shows a dramatic improvement in the radiation pattern and a measured front-to-back ratio of 20 dB for both the planes. Further analysis shows that the metal strip gratings help to improve the <b>directivity</b> and return <b>loss</b> of shorter LTSAs. Comparing with a basic LTSA without modification, the 4 lambda 0 LTSA has a 4. 3 dB and 14. 8 dB improvement on its <b>directivity</b> and return <b>loss,</b> respectively, which is 13. 2 dB and 22. 3 dB. In addition, the side lobe level is also suppressed from - 5. 2 dB to - 14. 4 dB. A new stepped profile formed by multiple constant slot width sections, to match the impedance between the feed and the aperture, is developed. This novel step-tapered profile increases the directivity of the antenna without increasing its length. A step-tapered slot antenna (STSA) is demonstrated at 28 GHz. It has a directivity of 7. 9 dB, a 2. 5 dB improvement over a LTSA with the same physical design, and {{shows no sign of}} main beam splitting. With the incorporation of the metal strip gratings, the directivity of the STSA further increases to 11. 0 dB with a return loss of 17. 2 dB. Finally, an improved CPW-to-slotline transition is developed for the STSA. The above work helps to open up the TSA for commercial millimetre-wave applications, such as radio-over-fibre, satellite communications and remote sensing, which previously were not feasible due to the requirements of fragile and costly ultra thin substrate or micromachining...|$|R

A statistical {{model of the}} path loss in the channel is presented, where the parameters in the model (i. e., path loss exponent and shadow fading statistics) are dependent on the particular Tx/Rx antenna combination. Time domain statistics of the channel (i. e., mean delay spread and RMS delay spread) are analyzed thoroughly for each antenna combination. There is {{a significant reduction in}} RMS delay spread when directional antennas are used at the transmitter and receiver as opposed to using omni-directional antennas.

40|$|Abstract—Indoor {{communications}} in the 60 GHz band is ca-pable of supporting multi-gigabit wireless access {{thanks to the}} abundant spectrum {{and the possibility of}} using dense antenna arrays. However, the high <b>directivity</b> and penetration <b>loss</b> make it vulnerable to blockage events, which can be frequent in indoor environments. Given network topology information in sufficient precision, we investigate the average throughput and outage prob-ability when the connection between any two nodes can be estab-lished either via the line-of-sight (LOS) link, through a reflection link, or by a half-duplex relay node. We model the reflection link as an LOS with extra power loss and derive the closed-form expression for the relative reflection loss. For networks with a central coordinator and multiple relays, we also propose a generic algorithm, maximum throughput path selection (MTPS), to select the optimal path that maximizes the throughput. The complexity of the MTPS algorithm is O(n 2) for networks equipped with n relays, whereas a brute-forced algorithm has complexity of O(n · n!). Numerical results show that increasing the number of relays can significantly increase the average throughput and decrease the outage probability, and resorting to reflection paths provides significant gains when the probability of link blockage is high.

The fractal structure is used in antenna designs because of miniaturization and the dipole antenna {{is one of the}} omnidirectional that can be easily designed. The 4, 5 and 6 series dipole and fractal dipole was investigated and compared. Both antenna designs operated at almost the same frequencies and the radiation pattern.
