25|$|Although {{investigations}} of higher cognitive processes, such as navigation and mental rotation are limited, the astronauts frequently {{report that the}} spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, {{and a reduction in}} the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the mental representation of three-dimensional cues in weightlessness. Perception is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the Newton's laws of motion. These laws change in weightlessness and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects’ shape and distance during spaceflight. The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> of gravity, at least for a short while. It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference.|$|E
2500|$|The Operator Function Model (OFM) is {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional task analysis techniques used by human factors engineers. An operator function model attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems. Miller (1985) suggests that the network structure {{can be thought of as}} a possible representation of an operator's <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> of the system plus a control structure which specifies how the model is used to solve the decision problems that comprise operator control functions.> ...|$|E

In other words, the subject is able to properly grip any load that they are provided because the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> provides such a good prediction of the object without any delay. Flanagan and Wing tested to see whether an <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> is used to predict movement-dependent loads by observing grip force changes with known loads during arm movements. They found that even when giving subjects different known loads the grip force was able to predict the load force. Even when the load force was suddenly changed the grip force never lagged in the phase relationship with the load force, therefore affirming {{the fact that there}} was an <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> in the CNS that was allowing for the proper prediction to occur. It has been suggested by Kawato that for gripping, the CNS uses a combination of the inverse and forward model. [...] With the use of the efference copy the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> can predict a future hand trajectory, thus allowing for the parallel grip to the particular load of the known object.|$|E

40|$|The {{main reasons}} for giving {{insurance}} companies the option to apply <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> for calculating the solvency requirement within the Solvency II framework is to enhance better risk management and to allow a more accurate risk oriented capital requirement than the standard Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) would provide. The possibility to use <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> within Pillar I basically means freedom to calculate the solvency requirement using some other formulae and even principles than those given by the standard formula. In our view within Pillar I, contrary to Pillar II, {{there is a clear}} need both for insurance supervisors and for those developing <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> in practise to have a common guideline among EU member states on how to validate and approve <b>internal</b> <b>models.</b> The tentative advice from The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) to the European Commission roughly follows the same approach. However, we believe that a broader scope of models and a more detailed approach to the validation will be needed for the final standard. This standard should give principles for the design of <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> and highlight areas that will be of greatest importance in the process of using <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> for calculating the SCR.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the empirical {{analysis of the}} second Basel regulatory framework implementation in Czech banks together with the economic performance inspection of the Czech banking sector.

40|$|Predicting the {{consequences}} of our own actions through <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> is {{an essential component of}} motor control. Previous studies showed improvement of anticipatory behaviors with age for grasping, drawing and postural control. Since these actions require visual and proprioceptive feedback, these improvements might reflect both the development of <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> and the feedback control. In contrast, visual tracking of a temporarily invisible target gives specific markers of prediction and <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> for eye movements. Therefore, we recorded eye movements in 50 children (aged from 5 to 19 years) and in 10 adults who were asked to pursue a visual target that is temporarily blanked. Results show that the youngest children (5 - 7 y) have a general oculomotor behavior in this task qualitatively similar to the one observed in adults. However, the overall performance of older subjects in terms of accuracy at target reappearance and variability in their behavior was much better than the youngest children. This late maturation of predictive mechanisms with age was reflected into the development of the accuracy of the <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> governing the synergy between the saccadic and pursuit systems with age. Altogether, we hypothesize that the maturation of the interaction between smooth pursuit and saccades that relies on <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> of the eye and target displacement is related to the continuous maturation of the cerebellum. status: publishe...|$|R

We suggest that such models are used to predict upcoming events and plan movements in anticipation of those events. We recorded eye, head, and hand movements while subjects caught balls thrown with a bounce.

40|$|International audienceTo {{control the}} sensory-motor system, <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> mimic the transformations between motor {{commands}} and sensory signals. The present study proposed {{to assess the}} effects of physiological adult ageing on the proprioceptive control of movement and the related <b>internal</b> <b>models.</b> To this aim, one group of young adults and one group of older adults performed an ankle contralateral concurrent matching task in two speed conditions (self-selected and fast). Error, temporal and kinematic variables {{were used to assess}} the matching performance. The results demonstrated that older adults used a different mode of control as compared to the young adults and suggested that the <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> of proprioceptive control were altered with ageing. Behavioural expressions of these alterations were dependent upon the considered condition of speed. In the self-selected speed condition, this alteration was expressed through an increased number of corrective sub-movements in older adults as compared to their young peers. This strategy enabled them to reach a level of end-point performance comparable to the young adults' performance. In the fast speed condition, older adults were no more able to compensate for their impaired <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> through additional corrective sub-movements and therefore decreased their proprioceptive control performance. These results provided the basis for a model of proprioceptive control of movement integrating the <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> theory and the continuous and intermittent modes of control. This study also suggested that motor control was affected by the frailty syndrome, i. e. a decreased resistance to stressors, which characterises older adults...|$|R
50|$|In {{the subject}} area of control theory, an <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> {{is a process}} that simulates the {{response}} of the system in order to estimate the outcome of a system disturbance.

However, whether auditory gaps are filled in predictively or restored a posteriori remains unclear. The current lack of positive statistical evidence that <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> can actually shape brain activity as would real sounds precludes accepting predictive accounts of filling-in phenomenon. We investigated the neurophysiological effects of <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> by testing whether single-trial electrophysiological responses to omitted sounds in a rule- based sequence of tones with varying pitch could be decoded from the responses to real sounds and by analyzing the ERPs to the omissions with data-driven electrical neuroimaging methods. The decoding of the brain responses to different expected, but omitted, tones in both passive and active listening conditions was above chance based on the responses to the real sound in active listening conditions. Topographic ERP analyses and electrical source estimations revealed that, {{in the absence of any}} stimulation, experience-based <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> elicit an electrophysiological activity different from noise and that the temporal dynamics of this activity depend on attention. We further found that the expected change in pitch direction of omitted tones modulated the activity of left posterior temporal areas 140 – 200 msec after the onset of omissions.
