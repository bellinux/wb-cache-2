The album was materialized while on her <b>Intimate</b> <b>and</b> Live Tour (1998) and contains remixes from her sixth studio album Impossible Princess (1997).

5|$|With its oak {{panels and}} other decor recalling an earlier time, {{the heyday of}} cabaret, the Oak Room was small, <b>intimate,</b> <b>and</b> {{expensive}} (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used to enlarge the Blue Bar, the rest was converted into a private breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers.|$|E

5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very <b>intimate,</b> <b>and</b> it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|In Lenin's absence, Stalin {{had begun}} {{consolidating}} his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating {{an image of}} himself as Lenin's closest <b>intimate</b> <b>and</b> deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.|$|E
5|$|In May 1998, Minogue {{confirmed}} the <b>Intimate</b> <b>and</b> Live concert tour, which commenced on 2 June at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia that same year. She initially wanted {{to finish the}} tour in Melbourne on 4 July, but due to high demand in England, the singer hosted three additional concert performances. The tour attracted positive reviews from spectators and publications, praising {{the idea of a}} smaller venue show, alongside compliments towards her vocal performance and stage presence. Each concert had drawn in approximately 2,000 audience members in Australia, and was deemed a commercial success by the Australian media. To complete the tour's promotion, an accompanying live album and DVD were released on 30 November and 23 July 2003, and was shot at Capitol Theatre, Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Tactile {{communication}} (touch) {{is mostly}} used by lemurs {{in the form}} of grooming, although the ring-tailed lemur also clumps together to sleep (in an order determined by rank), reaches out and touches adjacent members, and cuffs other members. Reaching out and touching another individual in this species {{has been shown to be}} a submissive behavior, done by younger or submissive animals towards older and more dominant members of the troop. Allogrooming, however, appears to occur more frequently between higher ranking individuals, a shared trait with other primate species. Unlike anthropoid primates, lemur grooming seems to be more <b>intimate</b> <b>and</b> mutual, often directly reciprocated. Anthropoids, on the other hand, use allogrooming to manage agonistic interactions. The ring-tailed lemur is known to be very tactile, spending between 5 and 11% of its time grooming.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more <b>intimate</b> <b>and</b> open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{the album}} {{experienced}} {{success on the}} Australian Albums Chart. It debuted at number four on 25 January 1998, the highest debuting album by an Australian female artist of the year. It stalled at number eight during its second and third week, but fell outside the top ten in its fourth. By 26 April, the album had spent 14 weeks in the chart and was placed at number 48, before leaving the chart. When Minogue promoted the album with live shows, alongside the announcement of a national tour, Impossible Princess re-entered the charts on 10 May at number 40. Whilst embarking her <b>Intimate</b> <b>and</b> Live tour in June, it entered the top ten for three non-consecutive weeks between the months June–July. In total, the album was present for 35 weeks in the top 50, making this Minogue's longest charting album at the time until her following studio album, Light Years, spent 41 weeks in the top 50 chart. The album was certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 70,000 units.|$|E

5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more <b>intimate</b> <b>and</b> which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties.|$|E
5|$|Up! Close and Personal is {{the fourth}} live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain. It was {{directed}} by Beth McCarthy-Miller, and produced by team composed of Dan Braun, Cliff Burnstein, Carol Donovan, McCarthy-Miller, Peter Mensch, and Marc Reiter. The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville, Tennessee, with an audience of 300 people. When conceptualizing the show, Twain desired to make the setting <b>intimate</b> <b>and</b> perform the songs acoustically, so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert. It was also modeled after Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black, leather jumpsuit. Up! Close and Personal premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on November 25, 2003, and was high in ratings, being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States.|$|E
