5|$|The {{network of}} lines south of Preston allowed great {{flexibility}} in the routing of trains. A train approaching the town {{on any of the}} lines from the south (except the WLR from Southport) could be routed to enter the station via either the North Union or the East Lancashire line. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> possible for trains from the north to perform an effective U-turn, a feat sometimes carried out by trains between Scotland and Blackpool that would otherwise have had to reverse.|$|E
5|$|UPCA {{became the}} first unit of the University of the Philippines to close after the war when it resumed classes on 25 July 1999, with Leopoldo Uichangco as dean. However, only 125 (16 percent) of the {{original}} students enrolled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> worse for the School of Forestry, which only had nine students. Likewise, only 38 professors returned to teach. UPCA used its ₱470,546 (US$10,800) share in the Philippine-US War Damage Funds (released in 1947) for reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

5|$|After {{the premiere}} of Trial by Jury in 1875, {{operetta}} companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Living Proof was mixed. Some music critics {{noted that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> better than Believe, while others criticized the {{excessive use of}} Auto-Tune. Commercially, the album did not reach the same success as its predecessor, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 82,000 copies. It was also received moderately in Europe, peaking within the top 30 in Sweden and the top 50 in the United Kingdom, despite being certified gold by both Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Living Proof is estimated to have sold {{more than a million}} copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together to make do. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E

5|$|For torpedo {{training}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> more difficult. Shallow {{water was}} needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel {{and as a result}} Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|Some early writers {{theorized that}} the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through {{competition}} with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids such as the American lion and the American cheetah also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests {{to the success of}} this feature.|$|E
5|$|The Daddies {{recorded}} {{their first}} demo cassette 4 From On High in July 1989, featuring four tracks of punk-tinged swing and funk rock. The tape {{went on to}} sell over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas, enabling the band to self-produce their debut LP Ferociously Stoned the following year. Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves, the album garnered favorable comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> officially released, Ferociously Stoned became a regional best-seller, setting a record for advance sales in Eugene's record stores and then remaining {{for over a year}} on The Rockets Northwest Top Twenty list, helping expand the Daddies' touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} largely {{accepted her}} proposal. The Charity School Spelling Book was printed first {{and was the}} most widely used. It {{was one of the}} first children's books for the poor that was small but still had large type and large margins (features often considered appropriate only for books for more privileged readers). The stories themselves were also innovative: they emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary children—"these children climbed trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep and begged in the streets". The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to tour {{in support of}} the album was made before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in Toronto, selling out within hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though {{it may have been}} a place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site was identified as a 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main reason people would pass through the commote; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E

The film was equally well received by critics, many of whom thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> better than the first installment, earning a rare 100% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 163 reviews. At Metacritic, the film earned a favorable rating of 88/100 based on 34 reviews. The film's widest release was 3,257 theaters and it grossed $485,015,179 worldwide, becoming the second-most successful animated film after The Lion King at the time of its release.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second half from goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice to lead to a 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E
5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be the first to get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
5|$|Mido {{eventually}} {{signed for}} Roma {{on the final}} day of the 2004 summer transfer window, for a fee of €6million, signing a five-year contract. It was confirmed that he would miss the opening game of the season, and possibly the following two games. Mido was penciled in to make his Roma debut against Messina in September 2004, a game in which he did actually play, but Roma lost 4–3. Reports suggested that Mido could be sold to Valencia in a swap deal with Bernardo Corradi and was also linked with a move to Premier League side Manchester City. Southampton were believed to have had Mido on their shortlist of targets, but his agent Christophe Henrotay said Roma would not be willing to let Mido leave the club. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> reported that he had been offered to Southampton on loan but his new agent, Mino Raiola, repeated the earlier claims that Roma wanted to keep Mido until, at least, the end of the season. He was linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, with his agent confirming he wanted a move away from Roma.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social stigma {{attached}} to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>even</b> possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took {{matters into their own hands}} and stole illicit goods back while impounded.|$|E
