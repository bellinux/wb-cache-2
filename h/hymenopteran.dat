5|$|Polistes exclamans {{is part of}} {{subfamily}} Polistinae {{within the}} <b>hymenopteran</b> family Vespidae. Polistinae (paper wasps) is the second largest of six vespid subfamilies, containing around 950 species, and is composed entirely of social wasps. It {{is made up of}} four tribes; P. exclamans is part of Polistini. Genus Polistes is currently split into four subgenera that are distributed across the world; P. exclamans {{is a part of the}} New World subgenus Aphanilopterus and is most closely related to P. annularis, P. buysonni, P. canadensis, P. lanio, P. cavapyta, P. simillimus, P. crinitus, P. versicolor, and P. instabilis.|$|E
5|$|The moths migrate in {{response}} {{to changes in the}} host plants. Chrysiridia larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings. The plants probably react by changing their nutrient and secondary compound levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. Omphalea populations that are not damaged by moths {{for long periods of time}} have lower toxicity. These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes might result from increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through semiochemicals, the plant may recruit <b>hymenopteran</b> parasitoids as a protection, hence playing a role in the population dynamics of the moth.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their <b>Hymenopteran</b> relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
50|$|Eggs and {{caterpillar}} {{are largely}} susceptible for many parasitized <b>hymenopterans,</b> and birds.|$|R
50|$|The species {{feeds on}} beetles, caddisflies, flies, <b>hymenopterans,</b> moths, and true bugs.|$|R
50|$|An ergatotype is a {{specimen}} selected {{to represent a}} worker member in <b>hymenopterans</b> which have polymorphic castes.|$|R
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other <b>hymenopteran</b> groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
25|$|A related phenomenon, {{polyembryony}} is {{a process}} that produces multiple clonal offspring from a single egg cell. This is known in some <b>hymenopteran</b> parasitoids and in Strepsiptera.|$|E
25|$|In many <b>hymenopteran</b> insects such as honeybees, female {{eggs are}} {{produced}} sexually, using sperm from a drone father, while {{the production of}} further drones (males) depends on the queen (and occasionally workers) producing unfertilised eggs. This means that females (workers and queens) are always diploid, while males (drones) are always haploid, and produced parthenogenetically.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis in insects {{can cover}} {{a wide range}} of mechanisms. The {{offspring}} produced by parthenogenesis may be of both sexes, only female (thelytoky, e.g. aphids and some <b>hymenopterans)</b> or only male (arrhenotoky, e.g. most <b>hymenopterans).</b> Both true parthenogenesis and pseudogamy (gynogenesis or sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) are known to occur. The egg cells, depending on the species may be produced without meiosis (apomictically) or by one of the several automictic mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} insects {{to adhere to}} {{surfaces}} is facilitated {{by the use of}} adhesive organs found on the terminal leg segments. These adhesive pads are inherently 'tacky' and are expected to be subject to contamination by particulates, leading to loss of function. Here, we investigated the self-cleaning of ants and beetles by comparing the abilities of both hairy and smooth pad forms to selfclean on both high and low energy surfaces after being fouled with microspheres of two sizes and surface energies. We focused on the time taken to regain adhesive potential in unrestrained <b>Hymenopterans</b> (Polyrhachis dives and Myrmica scabrinodis) and Coccinellids (Harmonia axyridis and Adalia bipunctata) fouled with microspheres. We found that the reattainment of adhesion is influenced by particle type and size in <b>Hymenopterans,</b> with an interaction between the surface energy of the contaminating particle and substrate. In Coccinellids, reattainment of adhesion was only influenced by particle size and substrate properties. The adhesive organs of Coccinellids appear to possess superior self-cleaning abilities compared with those of <b>Hymenopterans,</b> although <b>Hymenopterans</b> exhibit better adhesion to both surface types.

25|$|The {{males of}} P. gibbosus {{resemble}} the females very closely, {{but the most}} notable difference is the significantly reduced presence of yellow spots on the head. This is opposite of the usual pattern observed within the order Hymenoptera. Most commonly, the males in <b>hymenopteran</b> species have an excess of yellow spots on the head while females lack spots.|$|E
25|$|A gryllacridid was {{observed}} feeding on the eggs of O. magnificus, and a sarcophagid parasitoid has been reared from eggs {{of the same}} species. Five species of <b>hymenopteran</b> parasitoids are known to attack Mastiphora eggs. Tromatobia notator parasitizes M. cornigera, M. bisaccata and M. phrynosoma; Gelis sp. parasitizes M. cornigera. The eupelmids Arachnophaga abstrusa, A. ferruginea and A. picea parasitize Mastophora species, M. hutchinsoni and M. cornigera, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} space {{accessible}} and the time {{both male and female}} usually determines the site of copulation. Many <b>hymenopteran</b> males constantly fly around specific sites, usually the tops of tall trees, summits, or along hedges, where approachable females are found as they can also be resources visited by females for the purpose of feeding. In honey bee the queens join the mating area alone and are then pursued by a dynamic swarm of males. Those located {{in the front of the}} line usually achieve reproduction success. A queen usually mates with twelve males on an average of two mating flights and stores the sperm throughout her entire lifetime. Colonies sustain thousands of males but only a few queens, so only very few males are able to successfully mate with the queen.|$|E
50|$|These beetles can {{be found}} in other {{habitats}} where fungi are available, such as beehives, the nests of other <b>hymenopterans</b> such as wasps and ants, rodent nests, and wool.|$|R
50|$|The bats are insectivorous, with flies, beetles, and <b>hymenopterans</b> {{forming the}} bulk of their diet. They catch insects on the wing, using {{echolocation}} calls that start at 125 kHz and drop to 50 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|Perilitus brevicollis is a parasitoidal insect. Like {{some other}} <b>Hymenopterans,</b> it can {{reproduce}} through thelytokous parthenogenesis [...] P. brevicollis {{spends most of}} its larval stage developing inside the blue willow beetle (Phratora vulgatissima) [...]|$|R
25|$|Many {{invertebrates}} have {{color vision}}. Honeybees and bumblebees have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet. Osmia rufa, for example, possess a trichromatic color system, which they use in foraging for pollen from flowers. In {{view of the}} importance of color vision to bees one might expect these receptor sensitivities to reflect their specific visual ecology; for example the types of flowers that they visit. However, the main groups of <b>hymenopteran</b> insects excluding ants (i.e., bees, wasps and sawflies) mostly have three types of photoreceptor, with spectral sensitivities similar to the honeybee's. Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} <b>hymenopteran</b> order {{commonly}} sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and bradykinin. These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
500|$|A mite, Chrysomelobia mahunkai (family Podapolipidae) {{has been}} {{recorded}} from a single adult specimen of C. graminis, and [...] Eulophus chrysomela (a species of <b>hymenopteran</b> of the family Eulophidae) [...] is recorded as an endoparasite of the pupal stage.|$|E
50|$|Kneallhazia solenopsae has a {{life cycle}} that is almost {{perfectly}} adapted to the parasitization of fire ant colonies. Unlike other microsporidial pathogens of social <b>hymenopterans,</b> K. solenopsae infects all castes and stages of the host.|$|R
50|$|They are solitary insects, {{and most}} are parasitoids; the larvae feed on or in another insect until it finally dies. Being in the same order, {{ichneumons}} {{are closely related to}} other <b>hymenopterans,</b> such as ants and bees.|$|R
5000|$|Obtect pupa - {{appendages}} {{are attached}} {{closely to the}} body and are commonly encapsulated within a cocoon. Some adecticous pupa are obtect forms.

500|$|The forward {{margin of}} the hindwing bears a number of hooked bristles, or [...] "hamuli", which lock onto the forewing, keeping them held together. The smaller species may have {{only two or three}} hamuli on each side, but the largest wasps may have a {{considerable}} number, keeping the wings gripped together especially tightly. <b>Hymenopteran</b> wings have relatively few veins compared with many other insects, especially in the smaller species.|$|E
500|$|Myrmecia {{workers and}} queens possess a sting, {{which can be}} fatal to {{sensitive}} human beings. The sting {{has been described as}} [...] "sharp in pain with no burning", and the pain may last for several minutes. In the Starr sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of <b>hymenopteran</b> stings on a four-point scale, Myrmecia stings were ranked from 2–3 in pain, described as [...] "painful" [...] or [...] "sharply and seriously painful". Unlike in honeybees, the sting lacks barbs, and so the stinger is not left in the area the ant has stung, allowing the ants to sting repeatedly without any harm to themselves. The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in some species, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Examined workers of larger species have long and very potent stingers, with some stings measuring [...]|$|E
500|$|M. nigriceps is an {{extremely}} aggressive ant, and larger colonies may rival other colonies of a different Myrmecia species (such as M. gulosa) in terms of fierceness and pugnacity. While the mandibles cause little to no pain in humans, the ant {{is equipped with a}} painful and powerful sting that is found {{at the end of the}} gaster. Like other ants, the sting is not barbed, and workers are able to sting multiple times without injuring themselves. With a median lethal dose (LD50) of 7.3mg/kg, the venom is relatively weak in comparison to other Myrmecia ants, whose LD50 is much lower. However, in a 2011 study, at least one patient had an allergic reaction to M. nigriceps venom. This study also concluded that many other Myrmecia species can cause anaphylaxis, as well as the Green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica). In the Starr sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of <b>hymenopteran</b> stings on a four-point scale, the sting of M. nigriceps was ranked as two in pain, described as [...] "painful". M. nigriceps ants are able to enter colonies they do not reside in without being attacked; this may be due to these ants failing to recognise foreigners, or the consequences of ignoring workers from other colonies is low.|$|E
50|$|Hymenoptera {{originated}} in the Triassic, with the oldest fossils belonging to the family Xyelidae. Social <b>hymenopterans</b> appeared during the Cretaceous. The evolution of this group has been intensively studied by Alex Rasnitsyn, Michael S. Engel, Gennady Dlussky, and others.|$|R
50|$|In <b>hymenopterans</b> of the {{suborder}} Apocrita (wasps, {{bees and}} ants), {{it consists of}} the three thoracic segments and the first abdominal segment (the propodeum). For historical reasons, in ants it is commonly referred to by the alternative name alitrunk.|$|R
5000|$|Relatedness {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the strength of kin selection (via Hamilton's rule). The haplodiploidy hypothesis proposes that the unusual [...] relatedness coefficient amongst full haplodiploid sisters is responsible for the frequency of evolution of eusocial behavior in <b>hymenopterans.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Ichneumonidae are a {{parasitoid}} wasp family {{within the}} order Hymenoptera. [...] They are important parasitoids of other invertebrates; [...] common hosts are larvae and pupae of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. Over 24,000 {{species have been}} described worldwide. Estimates of the total species range from 60,000 to over 100,000– {{more than any other}} <b>hymenopteran</b> family.|$|E
2500|$|Allergic reaction-induced IgE-mediated {{anaphylaxis}} {{is commonly}} {{a result of}} <b>hymenopteran</b> stings. The composition of venom from a sting can even affect the types of treatment a patient should be given. Differences have been found between the composition of American and European Polistes venoms. Response to different epitope spectrums depends {{on the type of}} Polistes that did the stinging. P. gallicus venom was found to be a combination of four major allergens: Ag5 (antigen 5), hyaluronidase, phospholipase, and protease. This discovery has led to the addition of these allergens into a standard Polistes mix containing venom from North American species [...] to improve diagnosis and therapy for European patients with Polistes allergies.|$|E
50|$|Resident troupes {{of monkeys}} are sighted {{on the banks}} in large numbers, which {{are part of the}} Sasthamkotta temple {{environment}} {{on the bank of the}} lake.13 species of insects have also been identified; 9 are butterflies, 2 odonates and 2 <b>hymenopterans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some <b>hymenopterans</b> take {{advantage}} of parthenogenesis, the creation of embryos without fertilization. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which female embryos are created (without fertilisation). The form of thelytoky in <b>hymenopterans</b> {{is a kind of}} automixis in which two haploid products (proto-eggs) from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote. This process tends to maintain heterozygosity in the passage of the genome from mother to daughter. It is found in several ant species including the desert ant Cataglyphis cursor, the clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi, the predaceous ant Platythyrea punctata, and the electric ant (little fire ant) Wasmannia auropunctata. It also occurs in the Cape honey bee Apis mellifera capensis.|$|R
50|$|Another {{consequence}} is that <b>hymenopterans</b> {{may be more}} resistant to the deleterious effects of inbreeding. As males are haploid, any recessive genes will automatically be expressed, exposing them to natural selection. Thus, the genetic load of deleterious genes is purged relatively quickly.|$|R
