5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the <b>foreign</b> <b>objects.</b> The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} an {{antibody}} {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific <b>foreign</b> <b>objects.</b> This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.|$|E
30|$|The {{identification}} {{results of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> intrusion target in port transportation channel generally {{include the following}} three situations: first, there is a <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> in the image, and the recognition result is also {{the existence of a}} <b>foreign</b> <b>object,</b> that is, the target is correctly judged as the target. Second, there is no <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> target in the image, and the recognition result {{is that there is a}} <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> target, that is, the non-target is wrongly judged as the target. Third, there is a <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> in the image, and the recognition result is that there is no <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> target, and the target is wrongly judged as non-target.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} damages {{observed}} on the compressor {{and the gas}} generator blades suggests that they were hit by <b>foreign</b> <b>object.</b> The profile of the damages indicates that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> had a shape with circular circumference. In-situ compositional analysis carried out showed that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was made of an alloy of iron (Fe). Considering the shape and the chemical composition, inference can be drawn that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was a steel bolt/rivet. A detailed analysis carried out on the blades is presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|A damaged nose {{landing gear}} (NLG) door port of an {{aircraft}} {{was sent to the}} laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> damage (FOD) on the door surface. The direction of movement of the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was determined to be from rear to front. Compositional analysis carried out on the damaged surface showed that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was metallic in nature and it had a composition similar to 70 - 30 brass. Analysis suggests that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was probably debris of a body fired either from the aircraft itself or from elsewhere...|$|R
5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Steel cage match, which is fought {{in a cage}} with four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring, in which Randy Orton {{defeated}} Ric Flair by pinfall. Two bouts were featured on the undercard. In respective singles matches, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Shawn Michaels to retain his title and Gene Snitsky defeated Kane in a Weapon of Choice match, a match in which the use of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects,</b> which is usually illegal under the standard rules of professional wrestling, is allowed.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the damages {{observed}} on the stator vanes as well as rotor blades of LP compressor were caused by <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> and therefore, it can be termed as <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> damage (FOD). The nature of damages indicates that the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> was {{in the form of}} soft, solid mass. No traces of <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> were found present in the damaged regions and hence, the exact nature of the object could not be established. However, evidences do not suggest FOD by hard objects such as metallic materials or pebbles/stones. The rotor blade material was found to conform to the Al-alloy of specification AA 261...|$|R

Secondly, this study determines the dangerous area of <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> detection in the curved port transportation channel according to the method of marking the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> detection area in the actual scene, and establishes the <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> detection window of the dangerous area of the curved port transportation channel by the method of separating and reassembling the image first.
