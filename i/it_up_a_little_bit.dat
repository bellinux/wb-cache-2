[...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me."

[...] "I did the {{reference}} in the studio. It's a little more visual. Ne-Yo lightened <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and made it ready for radio. It works. I gotta sift through and see what I'm gonna put on the album. The Ne-Yo record is a stronger radio version.|$|E
5000|$|Vocalist Phil Labonte told Revolver {{magazine}} about band's {{approach on}} the new disc: [...] "We wanted to mix <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and write from a vocal perspective this time. So I went to L.A. {{and came up with}} vocal ideas and melodies and then sent those chord progressions back to Oli Herbert and he wrote riffs in response to that. Doing it this way turned the record into a vocal album as opposed to a guitar album. And that affected some things. Like, there might be less intricacy in the riffs because they were written in response to my voice." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} version of Directed by John Ford was {{shown at the}} 1999 Telluride Film Festival, garnering a strong positive reaction, and this success led Bogdanovich {{to believe that a}} re-edited version might be a viable option. He delivered a pitch to producer Frank Marshall, an old friend with whom he had first worked on the 1968 film Targets, promising to [...] "use all the good stuff and do some interviews with new people and jazz <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and make it more commercial, faster and incisive, and also more revealing." [...] Marshall, in turn, brokered a deal with Turner Classic Movies and Warner Home Video.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there are}} many {{similarities}} to the original version, many changes were made. Headwriter, RJ Nuevas, whose concept {{gave birth to the}} original series, further stated that compare to the original series, the new version's storyline is more matured and daring. [...] "We had to make the story more contemporary. This is a great challenge for all of us. After a decade, one of the most-loved teledramas in Philippine television will be given a different touch that is appropriate for today's times. We’re speeding <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> the series is good only for one season and putting some more interesting twists and turns", he added.|$|E
5000|$|What {{we tried}} to do with the record is capture what we do live and then just tighten <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> make it {{translate}} on record. Live, we may come across some stuff and jam on it, but the record brings it in and focuses on what we needed to do. We worked hard and we didn't rush it. I think we alright with this one.

5000|$|A {{producer}} J.R.

Play-N-Skillz also confirmed working with 50 Cent for the BISD project, saying: [...] Our rhythm on the drum pattern, we had to switch <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> 50 Cent said he {{wanted to go back to}} the boom-bap hard-core gangsta stuff. We tried to fit his style. I think 50 is gonna come back. He's a hitmaker. He's written a lot of hits for a lot of people. Sha told me 50's getting back in the Get Rich or Die Tryin mode. 50 is a person who doesn't like to know who the producer is. He just likes to go in with the music. But Sha Money XL is going crazy for the tracks we sent.|$|E
5000|$|The band's strong DIY mentality {{in terms}} of {{producing}} and recording their music was highlighted {{in an interview with}} The Stool Pigeon: [...] "You can record anything for free now. If you’ve got a laptop or a friend’s laptop, do it yourself,". However they left the mixing side of the project up to the Raveonettes' Sune Rose Wagner. On working with Wagner, White-Gluz said, [...] "We were recording in our space and it was sounding like shit, so we had the idea of someone helping to clean <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> but everybody in Montreal was asking for way too much money. And we’ve both always liked the way Raveonettes’ records sound. We exchanged emails a few times and we had exactly the same music tastes, so it just went from there". The final package [...] "convincingly captures the gloriously fuzzy, effects-covered sound of the shoegaze era, but escapes being mere copycats by adding a wonderfully spooky atmosphere and by writing hooky, easy to swallow melodies", said a 4.5 star review from AllMusic.|$|E

I said we got to start at the beginning and tweak <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> I couldn't use vampires because he did, so I wanted something that would be an earth-shaking change. Something that was forever, something that was really at the heart of it. I said, so what if the dead stop staying dead? ... And the stories are about how people respond or fail to respond to this. That's really all zombies ever represented to me. In Richard's book, in the original I Am Legend, that's what I thought that book was about. There's this global change and there's one guy holding out saying, wait a minute, I'm still a human. He's wrong. Go ahead. Join them. You'll live forever! In a certain sense he's wrong but on the other hand, you've got to respect him for taking that position.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning with issue #646 (November 2012), Journey into Mystery by Kathryn Immonen and Valerio Schiti shifted {{focus from}} Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, [...] "We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 {{we wanted to}} mix <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> Sif's been {{in the thick of}} it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior." [...] The series was {{cancelled}} in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up to the beautiful work that Kieron Gillen et al. had done previously and the amazing reader energy that had been generated. If all that had happened with our ten issues was to extend the influence of the astonishing Valerio Schiti, that would have been enough. As it is, I'm so proud of what Valerio, Jordie Bellaire, Clayton Cowles, Pepe and I put on the page under Lauren Sankovitch and Jake's fearless leadership. I'm also thrilled {{to have been able to}} write Sif as a fierce warrior and a lovable dork. I hope she finds a new home somewhere with a lot of things to say and a lot of things to kill.|$|E
5000|$|Ian Ward, {{portrayed by}} Ray Wise, {{made his first}} {{appearance}} on January 23, 2014, as a former cult leader, {{believed to be the}} biological father of Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) and former lover of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). Wise's casting in the recurring role was announced in December 2013. The character was slated to [...] "play an integral role in the lives of several Genoa City residents". Michael Fairman of On-Air Soaps wrote that, [...] "Now this is actually good casting {{if you look at the}} eyes of Ray Wise and Steve Burton!", and also asked if the character [...] "could become the next Mitch Laurence of daytime". Jillian Bowe of Zap2it wrote that, [...] "Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) and Dylan (Steve Burton) will soon have another family reunion in Genoa City." [...] Soap Opera Digest described Ian as a [...] "charismatic former cult leader who seduced a teen Nikki, resulting in the son he never knew he had (Dylan)". In an interview with the magazine, Wise stated that the director of How I Met Your Mother, a sitcom where Wise recurs, recommended him for the role to the soap opera's producer, Jill Farren Phelps. Wise also described and explained the character, stating: [...] "I think he's like everybody else; there's good and bad in all of us. Ian certainly has that. In the past, he's been the leader of a group of people. Now he has a philosophy and a kind of religion that he follows called The Path. He's in town to find out about a certain individual, but he's probably there to stir <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and I think he will." [...] After a nearly year long absence, Wise returned on September 4, 2015.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland in 1934; his aunt was Bess Berman, co-founder of the Apollo record label. He moved to New York City in the late 1950s and worked on jazz {{recordings}} at the Nola Penthouse studios with producer Tom Wilson. During the 1960s he began working as a producer {{in his own right}} on records by Miriam Makeba, Gladys Knight and others. [...] Regarding Astral Weeks, Merenstein said:"Warner Bros. Records had contacted Bob Schwaid manager, and he contacted me. And they had sent some producers, and they didn't know what he was talking about; people went up expecting to hear [...] "Brown Eyed Girl," [...] because the year before he had had [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] on Bang Records and that's what he was last known for. So Joe Smith and Mo Ostin asked me to go up Boston and listen to him. And I went up and it was at Ace Recording Studio at 1 Boylston Place, and there was Van Morrison, very timidly sitting on a stool and I came in very timidly sitting on a stool and he played! And the first tune he played was [...] "Astral Weeks." [...] Thirty seconds into it, my whole being was vibrating, because having spent all that time with jazz players, when he was playing, I could hear—the lyric I got right away; I knew he was being reborn. I heard 30 seconds, a minute and it went right through me, and I got the poetry of it. It was just stunning, and I knew I wanted to work with him at that moment. He went on and played more things, various tunes. And I guess everything was agreed on..." [...] After further rehearsals, Morrison and Merenstein went into the studio to record. Merenstein said: that [...] "...it was just beautiful, just beautiful. I forget if we did one take, two takes, how many times I may have interrupted it and asked the band to soften <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and maybe move the tempo a little bit. Van had nothing to say. He just went and sang the song. That's primarily the way the album proceeded... " ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Having Missy Elliott on our track {{literally}} means {{everything to}} us. She's been my idol since I was little, I literally adore her, {{and every single}} interview that would ask who's your dream collaboration to work with, I'd always say Missy Elliott. We've all {{wanted to work with}} her, she's just a legend. And something you dream of, that you never think is going to happen, and then when it did, I cried my eyes out, we were just in shock. To actually just hear her and see her and then when we first heard the rap, I cried." [...] —Jesy Nelson talking to Joanne Dorken of MTV News UK about the group's collaboration with Missy Elliott on the song. Following the release of the third single from DNA, [...] "Change Your Life", Little Mix aspired to release [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] as the album's fourth single, but with a different marketing strategy to that of the previous single's release. In an interview with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy, Jade Thirlwall mentioned, [...] "It was tricky with 'Change Your Life' because a lot of fans already had it from the album, it's hard to push songs that have been available to buy for months already, whereas 'How Ya Doin'?' is a bit different." [...] The group were keen on the track featuring a guest appearance from another recording artist. Jesy Nelson told Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, [...] "We just wanted to change <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and make it more funky and, yeah, just give something a little bit different." [...] She added, [...] "And plus we've never had a feature on any of our singles." [...] An opportunity to have American rapper Missy Elliott feature on [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] then arose, which Little Mix pushed for. Speaking to Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror, Nelson said, [...] "As soon as we thought there might be a chance Elliott would appear on the track we did literally everything we could to make sure it happened." [...] A collaboration between the group and Elliott was then arranged by Little Mix's A&R team. Despite featuring on the group's song, Elliott never met up with Little Mix for the collaboration. Instead, the rapper recorded and co-wrote her verse in the United States in 2013. Elliott is considered an idol for Little Mix and her feature on the song was met with shock and disbelief from the group. Media outlets were also surprised by the feature, some noting Elliott's support of Misha B, Little Mix's fellow contestant, during their season on The X Factor, as reasoning. [...] "How Ya Doin'?" [...] was chosen as a single to sonically depict the group's old school music roots, who they were inspired by and a change in sound from their previous singles. Little Mix consider the song as [...] "a brilliant single that makes you want to dance." ...|$|E
