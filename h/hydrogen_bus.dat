40|$|The transit {{authority}} in Perth, Western Australia, has put several alternative fuel buses, including diesel-electric hybrid and {{hydrogen fuel cell}} buses, into revenue service over the years alongside conventional diesel and natural gas buses. Primary data from this fleet is used to construct a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) model, providing an empirical LCC result. The model is then used to forecast possible scenarios using cost estimates for next generation technologies. The methodology follows the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Life Cycle Costing, AS/NZS 4536 : 1999. The model outputs a dollar value in real terms that represents the LCC of each bus transportation technology. The study finds that Diesel buses deliver the lowest Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The diesel-electric hybrid bus {{was found to have}} a TCO that is about 10 % higher than conventional diesel. The premium to implement and operate a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bus,</b> even if industry targets are attained, is still substantially greater than the TCO of a conventional diesel bus, unless a very large increase in the diesel fuel price occurs.

40|$|Sustainability {{transportation}} {{is characterized by}} a positive externality on the environment, health, social security, land use and social inclusion. The increasing interest in global warming has caused attention to be paid to the introduction of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bus</b> (H 2 B). When introducing new environmental technologies, such as H 2 B, it is often necessary to assess the environmental benefits related to this new technology. However, such benefits are typically non-priced due to their public good nature. Therefore, we have to address this problem using the contingent valuation (CV) method.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{analyses}} {{on energy}} scenarios for countries with high contribution of intermittent renewables {{point out that}} electricity generation from solar and wind energy may exceed the overall electricity demand during {{a large number of}} hours per year (that include peak periods). Thus, large-scale electrical –energy storage systems are required for grid balancing. Hydrogen production through solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) stands for promising power storage systems due to its high capacity and wide variety of applications. SOEC operates with steam in the range of 600 - 1000 °C, which, in this work, is supplied by a concentrating solar system. Based on its simplicity and low cost of the components, a linear Fresnel reflector coupled with castable ceramic thermal energy storage system was selected. Thermal oil was retained as heat transfer fluid avoiding phase change through the solar receiver. The heat is stored during the day for later use by the SOECs. The proposed hybrid plant, located in Seville, Spain, is analyzed under two scenarios. In the first one, the Solid-Oxide unit is only used as steam electrolyser producing hydrogen that is directly sell to a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bus</b> refueling station. In the second case, the device operates either as electrolyser or fuel cell, generating hydrogen that is stored and later used to produce electricity during peak periods.

40|$|The Southern Nevada Alternative Fuels Program is {{designed}} to demonstrate, in a day-to-day bus operation, the reliability and efficiency of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bus</b> operation under extreme conditions. By using ICE technology and utilizing a virtually emission free fuel, benefits to be derived include air quality enhancement and vehicle performance improvements from domestically produced, renewable energy sources. The project objective is to help both Ford and the City demonstrate and evaluate the performance characteristics of the E- 450 H 2 ICE shuttle buses developed by Ford, which use a 6. 8 -liter supercharged Triton V- 10 engine with a hydrogen storage system equivalent to 29 gallons of gasoline. The technology used during the demonstration project in the Ford buses is a modified internal combustion engine that allows the vehicles to run on 100 % hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen gives a more thorough fuel burn which results in more power and responsiveness and less pollution. The resultant emissions from the tailpipe are 2010 Phase II compliant with NO after treatment. The City will lease two of these E- 450 H 2 ICE buses from Ford for two years. The buses are outfitted with additional equipment used to gather information needed for the evaluation. Performance, reliability, safety, efficiency, and rider comments data will be collected. The {{method of data collection}} will be both electronically and manually. Emissions readings were not obtained during the project. The City planned to measure the vehicle exhaust with an emissions analyzer machine but discovered the bus emission levels were below the capability of their machine. Passenger comments were solicited on the survey cards. The majority of comments were favorable. The controllable issues encountered during this demonstration project were mainly due {{to the size of the}} hydrogen fuel tanks at the site and the amount of fuel that could be dispensed during a specified period of time.

40|$|Current energy related issues, such as {{climate change}} or the oil depletion, demand {{technological}} and societal change towards {{new ways of}} producing and using energy. One of the challenges coming {{with the development of}} these new solutions relates to the impact that these technologies will have on society, and how people will react to these technologies. This phenomenon {{is often referred to as}} public acceptance. The relevance of considering public acceptance of emerging technologies is self-evident, especially when thinking of the heavy controversy that surrounded technologies such as nuclear power or CO 2 capture and storage. The focus of this study is public acceptance of hydrogen technologies. Hydrogen (and related technologies) may be used in the future, for example, to heat our houses or fuelling our cars. Some believe that hydrogen may help in developing a more sustainable energy system. Others discuss to what extent this is actually possible. For example, it is unclear in which measure hydrogen may contribute to deal with issues like climate change, energy security or pollution; or whether hydrogen could be successfully stored or transported. Ever since I started this research, and every time I was explaining that the focus of my work was public acceptance of hydrogen, the most frequently asked question I received has been “So, are people going to accept hydrogen yes or no?!”. This question is, in my opinion, emblematic of a certain idea of public acceptance that I argue to be technocratic and potentially counterproductive. In this study, it is argued that the technocratic approach to public acceptance implicitly conceptualizes the public as a ‘barrier to overcome’, putting people either in an active position of rejecting something or in a passive position of ‘silently’ accepting it. This study challenges that idea of the public and public acceptance, largely present in the hydrogen literature, and aims at giving voice to the public in a way that citizens may maintain a positive role of ‘contributors’ to innovation. It is argued that the technocratic approach to public acceptance is inadequate particularly in the hydrogen case. Public acceptance of hydrogen is far too complex to be tackled in a ‘yes or no’ fashion. The complexity is three-folded. First, we want to know something on public acceptance of hydrogen even though hydrogen is not yet diffused. This issue, referred to as the issue of anticipation, poses a methodological and substantial question of how can we study public acceptance of hydrogen, when there is neither hydrogen technology to accept yet nor any “public” concern over a possible hydrogen implementation. Second, hydrogen is not only an element or an application (like a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bus),</b> but rather an entire infrastructure of many different technologies. For example, some citizens may be in favour of an out-of-sight system where hydrogen is used to store the extra energy of renewables, and being against a system that employs nuclear energy. Third, and related to the previous point, the public is heterogeneous is worldviews, beliefs, values and preferences. Different disciplines use a variety of methods to engage stakeholders and the public in technology assessment. Based on the lessons learned from these disciplines, this work proposes and applies an alternative approach to identify the voice of the public in a way that may help the anticipation of public acceptance in the hydrogen case. More precisely, this study aims at identifying the perceptions of citizens on hydrogen technologies in the context of the broader energy related issues. Citizens will look at hydrogen technologies in different ways, having different preferences according to how people look at the world, for example what they consider to be important or what they believe to be an issue relevant to solve. This is a frame, and the frames embed the (possible) preferences towards the different hydrogen systems. Frames define the problems, the solution space boundaries as well as the solutions that might fit those boundaries. In this study, hence, the citizens’ frames we aim to define are problems and solution space boundaries from the point of view of the citizens. In this way, we may infer if and how hydrogen may fit those frames. The output of this study is, ideally, a way of mapping the public through a set of frames A mixture of qualitative and quantitative techniques, namely a combination of focus group technique and the Q method, is used to identify the citizens’ frames. This study involved about 120 lay citizens - resident in Italy or the Netherlands – and produced a set of nine frames embedding the preference towards different hydrogen alternatives. The analysis of the frames identified through our Q studies showed shared points of view across our interviewees on what are the problems related to energy that should be addressed and by whom. Each frame represents a problem analysis, defining diverse and, sometimes contradicting, solution space boundaries. From the frame it is deduced which hydrogen systems may fit these boundaries. The results confirm that the public is heterogeneous and that there is no straightforward answer to the question of whether hydrogen will be accepted, yes or no. For example, it is possible to characterise the frames resulting from this study as environmental and promethean, although it will be shown that each frame expresses this categorization in different measure, making the distinction not so sharp in certain cases. For instance, it is made plausible through the analysis, that more radical green frames may be more compatible with decentralized-renewable hydrogen systems only. At the contrary other promethean frames are less compatible with the idea of a decentralized production, or of citizens producing their own energy. From a promethean point of view ‘energy’ is matter of economic and national interest, not a citizens’ responsibility. New technologies like hydrogen should fulfill the economic and strategic requirements beside the environmental ones. The variety of frames uncovered in this study might help opening-up the idea of the public in the eyes of those professionals who still think of the public as “those who don’t know” or “those who care about safety and the environment only”. The results also challenge the idea of a homogeneous risk-adverse public and stimulate the reflection on how do we think about and represent the public in complex issues involving new technologies. The ramifications of these results are also discussed, and some possible applications of the frames and Q method are proposed. For example, through the frames it would possible to design minipublics, i. e. small groups of lay citizens, potentially heterogeneous in the way of looking at hydrogen technologies. Those minipublics could be involved in deliberative exercises, aimed at reflecting on future technologies like hydrogen from a variety of citizens’ point of view, switching the focus from public acceptance in the classic (technocratic) sense to co-designing. This research leaves open a set of practical and methodological questions. For example, what is the effective relation between the frame and the preference, i. e. is the citizens’ preference actually determined by their frames in practice? And, what is the added value of discursive representation to select minipublics as compared to conventional methods; and how “generalizable” are the findings? In conclusion, there seems to be an alternative to the conventional way of anticipating public acceptance, namely, by addressing public acceptance through the frames identifiable through the Q methodology. This path promises practical applications and suggests further lines of research, to anticipate public acceptance better and better in the future.

40|$|One of {{the tasks}} of the HySafe Network of Excellence was the {{evaluation}} of available CFD tools and models for dispersion and combustion in selected hydrogen release scenarios identified as "standard benchmark problems" (SBEPs). This paper {{presents the results of}} the HySafe standard benchmark problem SBEP-V 11. The situation considered is a high pressure hydrogen jet release from a compressed gaseous <b>hydrogen</b> (CGH 2) <b>bus</b> in an underpass. The bus considered is equipped with 8 cylinders of 5 kg hydrogen each at 35 MPa storage pressure. The underpass is assumed to be of the common beam and slab type construction with I-beams spanning across the highway at 3 m centres (normal to the bus), plus cross bracing between the main beams, and light armatures parallel to the bus direction. The main goal of the present work was to evaluate the role of obstructions {{on the underside of the}} bridge deck on the dispersion patterns and assess the potential for hydrogen accumulation. Four HySafe partners participated in this benchmark, with 4 different CFD codes, ADREA-HF, CFX, FLACS and FLUENT. Four scenarios were examined in total. In the base case scenario 20 kg of hydrogen was released in the basic geometry. In Sensitivity Test 1 the release position was moved so that the hydrogen jet could hit directly the light armature on the roof of the underpass. In Sensitivity Test 2 the underside of the bridge deck was flat. In Sensitivity Test 3 the release was from one cylinder instead of four (5 kg instead of 20). The paper compares the results predicted by the four different computational approaches and attempts to identify the reasons for observed disagreements.
