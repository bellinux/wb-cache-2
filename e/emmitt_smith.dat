50|$|Dallas {{then reached}} their own 40-yard line on their next drive, but an illegal {{formation}} penalty nullified running back <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith's</b> 12-yard run. Troy Aikman then threw two consecutive incompletions, and the Cowboys {{were forced to}} punt again. The Bills subsequently advanced to midfield {{with the aid of}} a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Cowboys defensive lineman Leon Lett and a 21-yard reception by wide receiver Andre Reed.|$|R
25|$|Dallas {{receiver}} Kevin Williams {{returned the}} opening kickoff 36 {{yards to the}} Green Bay 49, sparking a 51-yard drive that ended with <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith's</b> 5-yard touchdown run.

Green Bay responded to the touchdown by driving 47 yards, including a 20-yard run by Robert Brooks, and scoring with a 50-yard field goal by Chris Jacke, but from this point on they would be buried under a mountain of Dallas touchdowns.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Murray had a total of 1,686 yards on the season and needed only 87 yards to pass Hall of Famer <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith’s</b> team record for the most rushing yards in a single season with 1,773 yards set in 1995. However, with Murray still nursing the injury, coupled with an early Cowboys rout, Murray ended up with only 22 carries for 59 yards on the day, leaving him with a total of 1,745 yards for the year, just 28 yards short of Smith's single season record with one more game left to be played.|$|R
25|$|In 1989, at {{the height}} of his NFL career, the Cowboys traded Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for a total of five players (linebacker Jesse Solomon, {{defensive}} back Issiac Holt, running back Darrin Nelson, linebacker David Howard, defensive end Alex Stewart) and six future draft picks. The five players were tied to potential draft picks Minnesota would give Dallas if a player was cut (which led to <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith,</b> Russell Maryland, Kevin Smith, and Darren Woodson). This was claimed to be a turning point in the rise of the Cowboys to the NFL's top echelon.|$|E

25|$|Defensive {{coordinator}} Dave Campo {{was promoted}} to head coach for the 2000 season. Prior to the season starting cornerback Deion Sanders was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41–14 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman {{for the rest of}} the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5–11 record. The only highlights of 2000 were <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith</b> having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.|$|E

5000|$|The 2002 Dallas Cowboys {{season was}} the 43rd {{season for the}} team in the National Football League. It was <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith's</b> 13th and final season with the team, officially marking {{the end of the}} famed [...] "triplets" [...] tenure in Dallas after wide {{receiver}} Michael Irvin was forced to retire prematurely after the 1999 season and quarterback Troy Aikman retired {{prior to the start of}} the 2001 season.

25|$|On October 12, 1989, the Vikings {{acquired}} Herschel Walker from Dallas. The {{final result}} of the trade gave the Vikings Walker, third-round choice Mike Jones, fifth-round choice Reggie Thornton and 10th-round choice Pat Newman in 1990 and a third-round choice Jake Reed in 1991. Dallas received Issiac Holt, David Howard, Darrin Nelson, Jesse Solomon, Alex Stewart, a first-, second- and a sixth-round choice in 1990, first- and second-round choices in 1991 and a first-, second- and third-round choice in 1992. Two of those selections turned into <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith</b> and Darren Woodson. Walker's performance fell short of expectations in his three seasons with the Vikings, while the Cowboys rode their draft picks to three Super Bowl victories in the early-to-mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|After {{trailing}} 13–6 at halftime, the Cowboys scored 24 unanswered {{points in}} the second half. The Bills had built their lead off of running back Thurman Thomas' 4-yard touchdown run. But just 45 seconds into the third quarter, Thomas was stripped of the ball, and Dallas safety James Washington returned the fumble 46 yards for a touchdown to tie the game. From there, Cowboys running back <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith,</b> who was named the Super Bowl MVP, largely took over the game. On Dallas' next possession, Smith was handed the ball seven times on an eight-play, 64-yard drive that was capped off with his 15-yard touchdown run. He later scored on a 1-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Overall, Smith had 30 carries for 132 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also catching 4 passes for 26 yards.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of 1995 season Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders away from San Francisco. Dallas started the season 4–0 {{including}} shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35–0 at Giants Stadium to open their season. <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith</b> set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12–4 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30–11 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38–27. In Super Bowl XXX the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 at Sun Devil Stadium for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.|$|E
50|$|In Week 15 {{against the}} Philadelphia Eagles, he {{suffered}} a broken left hand that required surgery the following day. Heavily bandaged, he did not miss any time and played the following week against the Indianapolis Colts. In Week 17, with his hand still bandaged, he rushed for 100 yards to pass <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith's</b> Cowboys franchise single season rushing record with 1,845 yards. Although he experienced great success {{and was in the}} league's MVP conversation, he battled fumbling problems, which included a key fumble in the divisional playoff loss against the Green Bay Packers. Murray earned the NFL's Offensive Player of The Year award {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Emmitt</b> James <b>Smith</b> III (born May 15, 1969) is {{a former}} college and {{professional}} American football running back who became the National Football League's (NFL) all-time leading rusher during his fifteen seasons in the league during the 1990s and 2000s.|$|R
25|$|Dallas {{took the}} opening kickoff and marched 75 yards to score on running back <b>Emmitt</b> <b>Smith's</b> 5-yard {{touchdown}}. Five seconds {{into the second}} quarter, the 49ers tied the game on quarterback Steve Young's 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Tom Rathman. But then the Cowboys scored three unanswered touchdowns to go up 28-7 before halftime. First they drove 80 yards in 11 plays to score on a 4-yard run by fullback Daryl Johnston. Then Thomas Everett intercepted the ball from Young and returned it 14 yards to the 49ers 24, setting up Smith's 11-yard touchdown reception from Troy Aikman. Five minutes later, Aikman finished a 72-yard drive with a 19-yard score to tight end Jay Novacek.|$|R
