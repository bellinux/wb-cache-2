The water changes the intensity of the SAXS in a way that depends on how the pores are filled. With wetting liquids such as hexane, a pseudo binary model can be assumed in which pore-filling in reciprocal space q is described by a density function p(q). For water, clusters develop, even in the most oxidized carbon, creating a fully ternary system. In the Porod scattering region, however, the final slope is insensitive to the liquid-vapour interfaces. In this region, for the less oxidized samples, p(q) shows reasonable agreement with the adsorption isotherms. At low relative pressure P/P 0, however, the SAXS results indicate a small <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>filling</b> (about 10 %) that is not reflected in the isotherms.

It was shown that all treatments induced a similar release of oxytocin without interruption until the end of milking. In particular, the latency period of up to 45 s did not cause a transient decrease of oxytocin concentration. In Experiment 2, milking characteristics were recorded in seven cows each in early, mid, and late lactation, respectively.
