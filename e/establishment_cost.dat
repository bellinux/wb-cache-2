30|$|Under {{scenario}} 1, mode changing cost (cost {{of providing}} mode changing facilities at multimodal terminals) {{is much lower}} than DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> (about one hundredth). Furthermore, transportation cost on road and railway networks, compare to seaway network, are triple and twice, respectively; and considered capacity for each DC is adequate to satisfy all retailers’ demands. Result show that under this scenario, only DC 1 (with lower <b>establishment</b> <b>cost)</b> established. Because of high DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost,</b> when one DC can answer to all the retailers demand (high vehicle capacity), just one DC establishes. In this scenario, seaway has the lowest cost and mode changing cost is negligible. So multimodal route is consists of four seaway and one railway links and multimodal terminal established at node 2. Under scenario 2, mode changing cost is raised to 10, 000 (close to that of DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost).</b> However, no change {{is seen in the}} results, i.e., seaway transportation still presents a costly justifiable approach, and similar to scenario 1, a multimodal terminal established at node 2. In scenario 3, mode changing cost is about five times larger than DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost.</b> The results show that change in transportation mode is no longer economic, and multimodal route products transported from supplier to potential DC 1 along the railway network. With sufficient vehicle capacity for all the demands, only one DC is established. Under scenario 4, mode changing cost set to 10, 000 and vehicle capacity decreased to 70, so that a single DC cannot answer all the demands. In this scenario, both of DCs established with a different multimodal route and delivery tour for each DC. In scenario 5, differences between transportation costs for three modes are lower than previous scenarios. Again, mode changing cost and vehicle capacity are set to 10, 000 and 70, respectively. Results show that in the multimodal network, products are transport along road (due to lower distance) and seaway (due to lower cost) networks. Since DC capacity has not changed, retailer routes are the same. Sixth scenario is similar to previous scenario with raise in mode changing cost. In this scenario model, choose a multimodal route with no changing in modes, so railway network (due to its continuity from the supplier to DCs) is preferred over road network (with lower transportation distances) and seaway network (with lower costs). The results show that a change in vehicle capacity can change the number of established DCs and affect routs to retailers.|$|E

40|$|Due to low {{availability}} of coking coal and huge <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> of Blast Furnace plants, the predominant route of Iron making has meandered {{away from this}} conventional route to a modern route of Iron making. This route involves production of Directly Reduced Iron (DRI) using non-coking coal and gases as the reducing agent.

They showed that ordinary paging algorithms {{can be used}} to derive algorithms for uniform connection caching and analyzed various algorithms such as Belady’s rule, LRU and Marking strategies. In particular, in [5] Cohen et al. showed that LRU yields a (2 k 1) -competitive algorithm, where k is the size of the largest cache in the network. In [6], they investigated Marking algorithms with different types of communication among nodes and presented deterministic k-competitive algorithms. In this paper we study generalized connection caching, also introduced in [5], where connections can incur varying establishment costs. This model is reasonable because the cost of establishing a connection depends, for instance, on the distance of the nodes to be connected and on the congestion in the network. Algorithms for ordinary weighted caching {{can be used to}} derive algorithms for gener-alized connection caching. We present tight or nearly tight analyses on the performance achieved by the currently known weighted caching algorithms when applied in generalized connection caching. In particular we give online algorithms that achieve an optimal competitive ratio of k. Our deter-ministic algorithm uses extra communication while maintaining open connections. We develop a generalized algorithm that trades communication for performance and achieves a competitive ratio of (1 +) k, for any 0 < 1, using at most d 1 =e 1 bits of communication on each open link. Additionally we consider two extensions of generalized connection caching where (1) connections have time-out values, or (2) the <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> of connections is asymmetric. We show that the performance ratio of our algorithms can be preserved in scenario (1). In the case of (2) we derive nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the best possible competitiveness. ...|$|E
