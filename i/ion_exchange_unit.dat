40|$|As {{the number}} of leaking {{underground}} fuel tank sites with MTBE contamination continues to grow, {{there is a need}} to develop cost-effective solutions for treatment of soil and water contamination. MTBE poses special challenges due to its physicochemical properties, in particular high solubility and low Henry s constant, low affinity for sorption, and very slow rate of microbial degradation. Advanced oxidation processes tend to generate undesirable byproducts. Based on laboratory studies with hollow fiber membranes (HFM), a field-scale unit was constructed and tested at a number of sites, to determine the effectiveness of this technology in dealing with MTBE contamination. In addition, to treat the soil contamination, the HFM unit was coupled with a Spray Aeration Vapor Extraction (SAVE) unit, which is based on an internal combustion engine. The engine provides the means to treat soil vapors, as well as organic vapors from the spray aeration and HFM units. The overall treatment objectives of 5 g/L for MTBE and 1 g/L for benzene were achieved with a treatment train consisting of an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit,</b> a spray aeration system, a hollow fiber membrane module and two granular activated carbon units, for flowrates ranging from 3. 8 to 30 L/min (1 to 8 gal/min). The <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> served to reduce water hardness and avoid scaling in the subsequent treatment units, extending the run-time of the entire system. Overall removal efficiencies for the spray aeration system and hollow fiber membrane module ranged from 85 to over 99 %. High removal efficiencies (> 97 %) were obtained at elevated water temperatures (54 o C) or lower flowrates (up to 11 L/min). The GAC units were used only to polish the effluent and meet the discharge requirements. Soil, water and gas phases are treat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the performance of a small scale <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> (Krudico, Inc of Auborn, IA) for removal of nitrate and perchlorate from groundwater at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Site 300. The unit was able to treat 3, 600 gallons of Site 300 groundwater, at an average influent concentration of 100 mg/L NO{sub 3 }{sup -} before breakthrough occurred. The unit contained 2. 5 ft{sup 3 } of Sybron SR- 7 resin. Seventy gallons of regeneration waste were generated (water treated to waste ratio of 51 : 1). The effluent concentration was about 20 mg/L NO{sub 3 }{sup -}, which is equivalent to a treatment efficiency of at least 80 %. There are several options for implementing this technology at Site 300. A target well, in the 817 area, has been selected. It has a 3 to 4 gpm flow rate, and concentrations of 90 mg/L NO{sub 3 }{sup -} and 40 {micro}g/L perchlorate. The different treatment options include ion exchange treatment of nitrate only, nitrate and perchlorate, or perchlorate only. Option 1 : For the treatment of nitrate only, this unit will be able to treat 3, 700 gallons of water before regeneration is required. If both columns of the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> are used, 7, 400 gallons could be treated before the columns will need to be regenerated (producing 140 gallons of waste, per cycle or every 1. 5 days). The effluent nitrate concentration is expected to be about 17 mg/L. Annual operation and maintenance costs are estimated to be $ 0. 14 per gallon of water treated. Option 2 : If only perchlorate is to be removed with ion exchange at the 817 area, a smaller unit should be considered. A 55 gallon canister filled with ion exchange resin should be able to reduce perchlorate concentrations in the groundwater from 40 {micro}g/L to non-detect levels for three years before the resin would need to be replaced. The contaminant-laden resin would be disposed of as hazardous waste. It is not practical to regenerate the resin because of the extreme difficulty of removing perchlorate from the resin. Due to the selectivity of the ion exchange resin, it will also be possible to selectively remove perchlorate from nitrate-contaminated water. Annual operation and maintenance costs are estimated to be $ 0. 02 per gallon of water treated. Option 3 : Another alternative is to treat both perchlorate and nitrate. A three column unit would be built. The first column would capture perchlorate and the resin would be replaced rather than regenerated. The second and third column would be operated as under Option 1 to treat nitrate. Annual operation and maintenance costs are estimated to be $ 0. 14 per gallon of water treated...|$|E
40|$|A {{principal}} {{role of the}} DOE Savannah River Site is {{to safely}} dispose of a large volume of liquid nuclear waste held in many storage tanks. An in-tank <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> is being considered for cesium removal to accelerate waste processing. This unit is planned to have a relatively high bed height to diameter ratio (10 : 1). Complicating the design {{is the need to}} cool the ion exchange media; therefore, the ion exchange column will have a central cooling core making the flow path annular. To separate cesium from waste the media being considered is made of resorcinol formaldehyde resin deposited on spherical plastic beads and is a substitute for a previously tested resin made of crystalline silicotitanate. This spherical media not only has an advantage of being mechanically robust, but, unlike its predecessor, it is also reusable, that is, loaded cesium can be removed through elution and regeneration. Resin regeneration leads to more efficient operation and less spent resin waste, but its hydraulic performance in the planned ion exchange column was unknown. Moreover, the recycling process of this spherical resorcinol formaldehyde causes its volume to significantly shrink and swell. To determine the spherical media's hydraulic demand a linearly scaled column was designed and tested. The waste simulant used was prototypic of the wastes' viscosity and density. This paper discusses the hydraulic performance of the media that will be used to assist in the design of a full-scale unit...|$|E

Chemical precipitation is an effective method to obtain calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite (HAP), which {{can be applied to the}} soil as a fertiliser. In a Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), the liquid effluent from the secondary clarifier is rich in phosphorus. This effluent can be introduced in an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> that, when being regenerated, produces a solution with a concentration up to 1, 000 mg PO 43 -/L. This stream can undergo chemical precipitation thanks to the addition of calcium ions with alkaline media.

A laboratory scale study is conducted using a semi continuous stirred batch reactor to precipitate phosphate of a solution that simulates the regenerated stream in the ion-exchange unit of a WWTP, using nanofiltration and reverse osmosis brines with and without Mg 2 + at different pH. Results indicate that the presence of Mg 2 + enhances phosphate removal, but does not stimulate HAP formation. The conditions that achieve higher phosphate removal are the NF and RO brines with Mg 2 + at pH= 10. 5, representing almost a 100 % of removal. In all four types of brines, higher removal is obtained at pH= 10. 5. The type of brine does not have as much effect as other factors such as the presence of Mg 2 + or pH. In less time, NF brine removes the same amount of phosphate from the solution than RO brine when there is Mg 2 +...|$|E
40|$|In August 2004 {{the last}} of the SIPP task testing ended [...] a task that {{formally}} began with the issuance of the RPP-WTP Test Specification in June 2003. The planning for the task was a major effort in itself and culminated with the input of all stakeholders, DOE, Bechtel National, Inc., Washington Group International, in October 2003 at Hanford, WA (Appendix A). This report documents the activities carried out {{as a result of that}} planning. Campaign IV, the fourth and final step towards the Semi-Integrated Pilot Plant (SIPP) task, conducted by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) at the Savannah River Site, was to take the several recycle streams produced in Campaign III, the third step of the task, and combine them with other simulated recycle and chosen waste streams. (Campaign III was fed recycles from Campaign II, as Campaign II was fed by Campaign I.) The combined stream was processed in a fashion that mimicked the pretreatment operations of the DOE River Protection Project [...] Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP) with the exception of the Ion Exchange Process. The SIPP task is considered semi-integrated because it only deals with the pretreatment operations of the RPP-WTP. That is, the pilot plant starts by receiving waste from the tank farm and ends when waste is processed to the point of being sent for vitrification. The resulting pretreated LAW and HLW simulants produced by the SIPP were shipped to VSL (Vitreous State Laboratory) and successfully vitrified in pilot WTP melters. Within the SIPP task these steps are referred to as Campaigns and there were four Campaigns in all. Campaign I, which is completely different than other campaigns, subjected a simulant of Hanford Tank 241 -AY- 102 /C- 106 (AY 102) waste to cross-flow ultrafiltration only and in that process several important recycle streams were produced as a result of washing the simulant and cleaning the cross-flow filter. These streams were fed to subsequent campaigns and that work was the subject of the issued Campaign I interim report (Duignan et al., 2004 a or Appendix I- 1). The streams created in Campaign I were used for Campaign II, and during Campaign II more of the same recycle streams were produced, with the addition of recycle streams created during the pilot-scale <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>unit</b> operation (Duignan et al., 2004 b or Appendix I- 2). Campaign III used the recycles from Campaign II and was the first campaign to use all the recycle streams (Duignan et al., 2004 c or Appendix I- 3). The operation of each of the subsequent campaigns, i. e., II, III, and IV, while different from Campaign I, are very similar to each other, and can be best understood as the process of operating a series of Pretreatment Unit Operations in a somewhat prototypic manner. That is, while Campaign I studied the operation of a single, albeit important, Pretreatment Unit Operation, i. e., Ultrafiltration, subsequent campaigns were to study the four major unit operations that make-up the RPP-WTP Pretreatment Facility. They are: Waste Feed Evaporation Process (FEP), Ultrafiltration Process (UFP), Cesium Ion Exchange Process (CIX), and the Treated LAW Evaporation Process (TLP). Each of the campaigns operated basically as a separate subtask, but as with Campaign I, the recycle streams produced in one campaign were fed into the subsequent campaign. Therefore, all four campaigns were chemically connected through these recycle streams, which carry over effects of the preceding campaign. The results of Campaign IV operations are the subject of this fourth and final report. Separate reports were issued after each of the previous campaigns, but they were treated as interim because of being limited to the results obtained from a single campaign (or past campaigns) and further limited to only highlights of that single campaign. This final report not only discusses the Campaign IV results but compares those with the previous campaigns.

It is also the primary <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> material under consideration for SCIX at the Hanford site. The elution step of the multi-step <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> process is typically done with 0. 5 M nitric acid. An acid eluant is a potential hazard {{in the event of a}} spill, leak, etc. because the high-level waste tanks are made of carbon steel. Corrosion and associated structural damage may ensue. A study has been conducted to explore non-acid elution as an alternative. Batch contact sorption equilibrium screening tests have been conducted with 36 potential non-acid eluants. The sorption tests involve equilibrating each cesium-containing eluant solution with the sRF resin for 48 hours at 25 C in a shaker oven. In the sorption tests, an eluant is deemed to have a high cesium elution potential if it minimizes cesium sorption onto the sRF resin. The top candidates (based on lowest cesium sorption distribution coefficients) include ammonium carbonate, ammonium carbonate/ammonium hydroxide, ammonium bicarbonate, rubidium carbonate, ammonium acetate, ammonium acetate/ammonium hydroxide, ammonium bicarbonate/ammonium hydroxide, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride. A select few of the top candidate eluants from the screening tests were subjected to actual sorption (loading) and elution tests to confirm their elution ability. The actual sorption (loading) and elution tests mimicked the typical sRF-cesium <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> process (i. e., sorption or loading, caustic wash, water rinse, and elution) via batch contact sorption and quasi column caustic wash/water rinse/elution.

Results Here, we have used Vivapure <b>Ion</b> <b>Exchange</b> centrifugal adsorber <b>units</b> to rapidly prefractionate total fission yeast protein lysate based on protein charge. Three fractions were prepared by stepwise elution with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. Each of the fractions, as well as the total lysate, were analyzed by 2 D-PAGE. This simple prefractionation procedure considerably increased the resolving power of 2 D-PAGE. Whereas 308 spots could be detected by analysing total protein lysate, 910 spots were observed upon prefractionation.

Today <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes are successfully applied for desalination of both sea water and brackish water, softening hard water, treating industrial effluents for removal of heavy metals, dyes, nitrates, ammonia and fluoride and dealkalization. In spite of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> technology advanced stage of development, various aspects remain a subject of intensive investigations in many institutes to bring about new functional materials that can tolerate various operating conditions to improve its efficiency and economy of its applications. The objective of this chapter is to review the current status of the development in <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> materials and their applications in the field of water and waste water treatment. A brief encounter of the basic fundamentals of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> processes including mechanism, types of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> resins and systems, configurations and mode of operation are also illustrated...|$|R

Research {{has made significant}} advances {{in the development of}} new hybrid cultivars and best management practices for vineyards. However, some issues such as high pH/ high titratable acidity wines still stand as a barrier to wine quality improvements. <b>Ion</b> <b>exchange</b> is a method of acid adjustment helps to correct high pH/high titratable acidity wines. <b>Ion</b> <b>exchange</b> is not widely utilized throughout the wine industry due to concerns that it negatively impacts many aspects of wine quality such as color, flavor, and aroma. The impacts of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> on the several important parameters including volatile aromas were assessed in several Missouri wines (Norton, Chambourcin, and Valvin Muscat). Significant differences were determined in <b>ion</b> <b>exchanged</b> wines. The benefits of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> appear to outweigh the drawbacks. Further optimization of the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> process can mitigate the negative impacts...|$|R
