40|$|Regulation of {{the human}} immune system {{requires}} controlled pro- and anti-inflammatory responses for host defence against infection and disease states. Yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), as used in brewing and baking, are mostly known for ability to stimulate the human immune-system predominantly reflecting the pro-inflammatory cell wall b-glucans. However, in this study, using food-compatible processing methods, glycopeptide-enriched and b-glucan-depleted products were each prepared from Brewer&# 039;s and Baker&# 039;s yeasts, which suppressed production of interferon-c (IFN-c) in human whole blood cell assay, signifying that anti-inflammatory factors are also present in yeast. Anti-inflammatory bioactivities of products prepared from Brewer&# 039;s and Baker&# 039;s yeast were compared with the commercial yeast product, <b>Epicor.</b> While unfractionated <b>Epicor</b> was inactive, the C 18 resin-binding fractions of Brewer&# 039;s and Baker&# 039;s yeast products and <b>Epicor</b> dose-dependently lowered IFN-c, demonstrating that <b>Epicor</b> also contained both pro-inflammatory (b-glucans) and anti-inflammatory components. Anti-inflammatory activity was attributed to C 18 resin-binding species glyco-peptides in <b>Epicor</b> and experimental yeast products. This study demonstrated that pro- and anti-inflammatory factors could be resolved and enriched in yeasts by suitable processing, with potential to improve specific activities...|$|E
40|$|<b>EpiCor,</b> {{derived from}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{has been shown}} to have immunomodulating {{properties}} in human clinical trials and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanisms behind its immune protection via the gut remain largely unknown. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} use an integrated in vitro approach to evaluate the metabolism of <b>EpiCor</b> by the intestinal microflora, its modulating effect on the gut microbiota, and its anti-inflammatory activity on human-derived cell lines. Using the SHIME model, in combination with a mucus adhesion assay, has shown that low doses of <b>EpiCor</b> have a prebiotic-like modulatory effect on the luminal- and mucosa-associated microbiota. These include gradual changes in general community structure, reduction of potential pathogens, quantitative increase in lactobacilli, and qualitative modulation of bifidobacteria. Moreover, by combination of the SHIME with Caco- 2 cells and Caco- 2 /THP 1 cocultures, a significant decrease in pro inflammatory cytokines was observed at the end of the treatment period...|$|E
40|$|Unaccustomed {{eccentric}} exercise {{has been}} well documented to elicit muscle damage and an inflammatory response to help fix and restore the impaired muscle fibers. Supplements, including anti-inflammatories and antioxidants have been used to help alleviate the damage and decrease the inflammation but positive results are slim. It is proposed that <b>EpiCor,</b> a yeast metabolite with suggested anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics, would decrease the amount of muscle soreness and inflammation that results from unaccustomed eccentric exercise. Thirty-two male subjects (ages 18 - 35) ingested a once daily 500 mg dose of either <b>EpiCor</b> or placebo 4 weeks prior to the eccentric exercise bout. This matched pairs, double blind study randomly assigned subjects to either group and were matched based on a peak, pre-exercise maximal isometric contraction. Subjects then performed 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors at 30 degrees per second on each arm. Blood samples were taken at pre-, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise, in addition to psychological and illness surveys. Muscle damage, soreness and circumference all had a significant effect of time throughout the 72 hour recovery period (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Elevated levels of CK and LDH were also present with a significant effect of time (P 3 ̆c 0. 05); however, {{there were no significant differences}} between treatments for muscle damage indicators. Results for inflammatory markers were similar in that no statistically significant difference between groups existed for IL- 1 ra, IL- 6, IL- 10, and CRP, but some non-significant trends (P 3 ̆c. 11) did exist. These results do not support the hypothesized effects for <b>EpiCor</b> in reducing the muscle damage, soreness, and inflammation after an unaccustomed eccentric exercise bout of the elbow flexors. This supplement needs further research into the effectiveness of its use in an exercise setting...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe <b>Epicor</b> system ® {{is based}} on high {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy used for creating a wide circumferential linear left atrial lesion encircling both left atrial posterior wall and pulmonary veins (box lesion) and provides long-term cure in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing heart surgery. Whether if acute complete disconnection of the box lesion is achieved by application of HIFU is unknown. Methodsbipolar pacing and detection into the box lesion was studied in 9 pts (5 men, 77 ± 18 yo) undergoing heart surgery (5 aortic valve replacement, 3 mitral valve repair or replacement and one coronary by-pass) using bipolar electrophysiological catheter and a real time telemetry (Medtronic CareLink® programmer), just after completion of the ablation process on the beating heart prior to initiation of extracorporeal circulation. Sinus rhythm was present or obtained using internal cardioversion in each before the ablation process. ResultsEntrance block was absent in 7 (1 to 1 conduction from sinus rhythm inside the box lesion), undetermined in one and present in one (dissociated slow local rhythm). Exit block was lacking in 6 (capture of the cardiac rate by pacing inside the box lesion) and present in 3 (dissociated sinus rhythm from the paced area). ConclusionAcute complete block of the <b>Epicor</b> ® HIFU induced box lesion is lacking {{in the vast majority}} of pts despite completion of the energy deliverance according to the automated ablation process. Whether block later happens, or whether supplementary applications would increase the electrophysiological and clinical success rate is unknown...|$|E

40|$|Objectives This sub-analysis of the <b>EPICOR</b> study {{describes}} pre-hospital care (PHC) {{patterns in}} Belgium, Luxembourg (Belux) and Western European (WEU) countries (Finland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, UK, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Germany). Methods and results <b>EPICOR</b> (NCT 01171404) is a multinational, observational study comprising patients with {{acute coronary syndrome}} hospitalized within 24 h of symptoms onset, diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA). Of the 325 WEU centres, 37 were in Belgium and 1 in Luxembourg. PHC was defined as pre-hospital ECG and/or pre-hospital medication (PHM). 504 Belux and 6, 119 WEU patients were enrolled. Of the WEU patients 51. 5 % received PHC and 28. 1 % PHM, compared to 27. 6 % and 11. 3 % of the Belux patients. These differences were observed in both STEMI and UA/NSTEMI patients. In Belux, the most frequent PHM was acetylsalicylic acid (53 patients); only 1 patient received thrombolytics. The median time from symptoms onset to ECG was longer for Belux (2. 8 h) than for WEU patients (2. 4 h). PHC shortened this time by almost 1. 5 h. Belux patients with PHC had a shorter median time between symptoms onset and first medical attention (FMA) than WEU patients (1. 0 h vs 1. 3 h). Only 34. 7 % of Belux patients with pre-hospital ECGandwith timefrom FMA to ECG available had ECG within 10 minutesofFMA,as recommended by the European Society of Cardiology. Conclusions In Belux, diagnostic ECG is delayed compared to WEU, despite the short time to FMA. Few patients undergo ECG within the recommended period, indicating room for improvement.
