5|$|In {{an episode}} of the British comedy show The Goodies, {{entitled}} Animals, nature presenters from the BBC are forced to escape in rabbit suits from the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> animals now granted equal rights with humans.

5|$|Rojhaz, {{looking more}} like the Captain America of old (or of the future, {{as the case may}} be), refuses to go back through the rift: he hopes to build a better America from the beginning. Fury tricks Rojhaz by playing on the trust that Captain America had for the Nick <b>Fury</b> <b>of</b> his own time, knocks him {{unconscious}} and carries the body back through the rift, thus going into the future himself.|$|E

5|$|With {{the release}} of their 1990 debut LP, No Depression, the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle Tupelo {{launched}} more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> Churchill, {{the loss}} of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{one of his}} paintings, Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} <b>Fury</b> <b>of</b> the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour {{and his ability to}} produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{ends with}} the boys {{mourning}} at Kenny's grave and deciding {{to go home to}} eat candy as well as look at photos of Liane Cartman, who is on the cover of a porn magazine, much to the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> Cartman claiming she was young and needed the money; Stan says the photos were taken a month ago, infuriating Cartman even more. Kenny returns as a zombie again, but a statue lands on him, followed by an airplane.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1590s, Lopez was wealthy and {{generally}} respected. He owned a comfortable house in Holborn {{and had his}} youngest son Anthony enrolled at Winchester College. He incurred the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> {{one of his former}} patients, Queen Elizabeth's favourite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, when he described to Dom António and the Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez occasions on which he had treated Essex for venereal diseases. Learning of this from Pérez, Essex began to assemble evidence implicating Lopez as some sort of fifth columnist in the pay of King Philip II of Spain. The Lord High Treasurer Lord Burghley initially thought Essex's allegations against Lopez absurd; the Queen herself also rebuked Essex.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> the conservatives.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the {{expedition}} {{at the behest}} of his friend Jameson, much to the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> many of the izinDuna, who saw the column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, and escorted by 500 British South Africa Company's Police under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather, the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from Bechuanaland and then north, and founded Fort Tuli, Fort Victoria and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped {{at the site of the}} future capital, Fort Salisbury (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the Union Jack the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke {{to make the most of}} it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and a tenuous peace was established within the palace.|$|E

5|$|Critchell's loan at York was {{extended}} {{for a second}} month, with the fitness of several York defenders in doubt. York were beaten 1–0 away by Mansfield, courtesy of a Robert Duffy penalty, in the teams' fourth encounter of the season. A 13–12 penalty shoot-out victory over Kidderminster followed a 1–1 extra time draw in an FA Trophy replay; in normal time, McBreen scored a header from a corner delivered by Simon Rusk before the away team equalised shortly after through Justin Richards. A new record for the most consecutive penalties scored in a shoot-out was set, at 25. McBreen {{was reported to have}} signed for North Queensland <b>Fury</b> <b>of</b> the A-League, although the transfer had yet to be confirmed by York. It was confirmed that he would join the Fury for the start of 2009–10 in August 2009. Former Wrexham defender Shaun Pejic signed after a successful trial at the club. York beat Conference South team Havant & Waterlooville 2–0 at home in the fourth round of the FA Trophy to secure a place in the semi-final, with both goals scored by McBreen. This was followed by a 2–0 away defeat to Rushden in the league. York's first league victory in a month was a 2–0 home win over Weymouth, who were forced to play a weakened team due to their financial situation, and Brodie scored headers in each half.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, Olga was in Russia at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia, Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort. Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister-in-law, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. Other members of the imperial family, such as Princess Helen and Olga's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front. As the war continued, Olga {{became aware of the}} growing crisis in Russia, and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen. A few weeks later, Olga attracted the <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra's favorite mystic, Grigori Rasputin.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting <b>fury</b> <b>of</b> exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
