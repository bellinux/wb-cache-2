50|$|Despite {{the terms}} being {{commonly}} interchanged, not all <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are Hox genes; the MADS-box <b>genes</b> are <b>homeotic</b> but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes {{are a subset}} of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{identity}} of floral organs in Arabidopsis thaliana {{is determined by}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes,</b> which are expressed in specific regions of the developing flower. The initial activation of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> is accomplished {{at least in part}} by the products of two earlier acting genes with overlapping functions. These are the floral meristem—identity genes LEAFY and APETALA 1. The requirements of LEAFY and APETALA 1 activity vary for different <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
50|$|While the {{segmentation}} genes can {{specify the}} number, size, and polarity of segments, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> can specify {{the identity of}} the segment. The <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are activated by gap genes and pair-rule genes. The Antennapedia complex and the bithorax complex on the third chromosome contain the major <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> required for specifying segmental identity (actually parasegmental identity). These genes are transcription factors and are expressed in overlapping regions that correlate with their position along the chromosome. These transcription factors regulate other transcription factors, cell surface molecules with roles in cell adhesion, and other cell signals. Later during development, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are expressed in the nervous system in a similar anterior/posterior pattern. <b>Homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are maintained throughout development through the modification of the condensation state of their chromatin. Polycomb genes maintain the chromatin in an inactive conformation while trithorax genes maintain chromatin in an active conformation.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{chromosome}} in {{the figure}} has three normal genes and one <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> and encodes a main program that invokes three different functions {{a total of four}} times, linking them in a particular way.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> cluster, the bithorax complex, was {{discovered}} by Edward B. Lewis in 1978. Similar mutations in the complex were found to cluster together, leading Lewis to propose that these homeotic genes arose through a duplication mechanism which would conserve the clusters through evolution.The independent discoveries of the homeobox in the 1983 by Walter Gehring's laboratory at the University of Basel, Switzerland, and Thomas Kaufman's laboratory at Indiana University confirmed Lewis's theory.|$|E

50|$|In {{evolutionary}} developmental biology, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are genes which {{regulate the}} development of anatomical structures in various organisms such as echinoderms, insects, mammals, and plants. This regulation is done via the programming of various transcription factors by the <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes,</b> and these factors affect genes through regulatory genetic pathways.|$|R
50|$|<b>Homeotic</b> {{selector}} <b>genes</b> confer segment {{identity in}} Drosophila. They encode homeodomain proteins which interact with Hox and other <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> to initiate segment-specific gene regulation. Homeodomain proteins are transcription factors that share a DNA-binding domain called the homeodomain. Changes in the expression {{and function of}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> {{are responsible for the}} changes in the morphology of the limbs of arthropods {{as well as in the}} axial skeletons of vertebrates. Mutations in <b>homeotic</b> selector <b>genes</b> do not lead to elimination of a segment or pattern, but instead cause the segment to develop incorrectly.|$|R
50|$|In mammals Polycomb Group gene {{expression}} {{is important in}} many aspects of development like <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> regulation and X chromosome inactivation, being recruited to the inactive X by Xist RNA, the master regulator of XCI. The Bmi1 polycomb ring finger protein promotes neural stem cell self-renewal. Murine null mutants in PRC2 genes are embryonic lethals while most PRC1 mutants are live born homeotic mutants that die perinatally. In contrast overexpression of PcG proteins correlates with the severity and invasiveness of several cancer types. The mammalian PRC1 core complexes {{are very similar to}} Drosophila. Polycomb Bmi1 is known to regulate ink4 locus (p16Ink4a, p19Arf).|$|E
50|$|Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) is a {{transcription}} factor encoded {{by a member}} of the Spalt-like (SALL) gene family, SALL4. The SALL genes were identified based on their sequence homology to Spalt, which is a <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> originally cloned in Drosophila melanogaster that is important for terminal trunk structure formation in embryogenesis and imaginal disc development in the larval stages. There are four human SALL proteins (SALL1, 2, 3, and 4) with structural homology and playing diverse roles in embryonic development, kidney function, and cancer. The SALL4 gene encodes at least three isoforms, termed A, B, and C, through alternative splicing, with the A and B forms being the most studied. SALL4 can alter gene expression changes through its interaction with many co-factors and epigenetic complexes. It is also known as a key embryonic stem cell (ESC) factor.|$|E
50|$|In {{segmented}} organisms {{there are}} genes called Hox genes, which determines {{the development of}} serial homologs, or repeating structures within an organism (e.g. jointed appendages of arthropods or vertebrae in mammals). In insects, the thorax is separated into different segments. One {{of the things that}} the Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is responsible for, is specifying the identity of the third thoracic segment of their body. Proper hindwing development in a number of insect species is dependent on Ubx, including butterflies, beetles, and flies. In fruit flies, (Ubx) is responsible for the formation of the halteres during metamorphosis. If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully formed wing. This single <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> change results in a radically different phenotype, but also begins to give us some insight into how the ancestors of flies' hindwings may have originally evolved into halteres.|$|E
25|$|Drosophila melanogaster – Edward Lewis {{discovered}} the Drosophila Bithorax complex of <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>gene</b> {{expression}} programming, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> {{control the}} interactions of the different sub-ETs or modules of the main program. The expression of such genes results in different main programs or cells, that is, they determine which genes are expressed in each cell and how the sub-ETs of each cell interact with one another. In other words, <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> determine which sub-ETs are called upon and how often in which main program or cell {{and what kind of}} connections they establish with one another.|$|R
40|$|The <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are strikingly conserved between {{invertebrates}} and vertebrates. There is conservation, {{not only}} of the homeobox sequences, but also of their collinear order on the chromosome. The genes are found in clusters or 'complexes', and are arranged on the chromosome in the order of their function along the anteroposterior body axis (for review, see ref. 1). In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, the <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are split into two separate clusters, the Antennapedia complex (ANTP-C) and the Bithorax complex (BX-C), which direct development of the anterior and posterior segments, respectively. We show that in Drosophila virilis, a closely related species, the <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> are also in two clusters, but the split occurs within the BX-C. The existence of two independent splits in the Drosophila lineage suggests that these flies lack the molecular constraint responsible for the ordered clusters in other animals...|$|R
50|$|Much {{research}} has been done on homeotic genes in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how homeotic genes affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of homeotic genes can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused homeotic genes in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs. In another study, {{it was found that the}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> Cdx2 acts as a tumor suppressor. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to carcinogens; however, when Cdx2 was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development. These studies, along with many others, show the importance of homeotic genes even after development.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to vegetative apical meristems and some exflorescence meristems, floral meristems cannot {{continue to grow}} indefinitely. Their future growth {{is limited to the}} flower with a particular size and form. The transition from shoot meristem to floral meristem requires floral meristem identity genes, that both specify the floral organs and cause the termination of the production of stem cells. AGAMOUS (AG) is a floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> required for floral meristem termination and necessary for proper development of the stamens and carpels. AG is necessary to prevent the conversion of floral meristems to inflorescence shoot meristems, but is not involved in the transition from shoot to floral meristem. AG is turned on by the floral meristem identity gene LEAFY (LFY) and WUS and is restricted to the centre of the floral meristem or the inner two whorls. This way floral identity and region specificity is achieved. WUS activates AG by binding to a consensus sequence in the AG’s second intron and LFY binds to adjacent recognition sites. Once AG is activated it represses expression of WUS leading to the termination of the meristem.|$|E
50|$|Changes in <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} {{contributes to}} the diversity. The Drosophila genome holds its eight homeotic genes in two complexes. The Invertebrate genome contains 8-10 of is homeotic genes in only one complex, while Vertebrates have duplicated the Hox complex and have four clusters. Changes in the expression and functionality of individual genes result in various morphology as seen in arthropods. The diversity found between the five groups of arthropods {{is a result of}} their modular architecture. The arthropods are composed of a series of repeating body segments that can be modified in a limitless number of ways. While some segments may carry antenna, others can be modified to carry wings. Crustaceans have different morphology within the group due to different patterns of Ubx expression in isopods and brachiopods. Similar to brachiopods, isopods have swimming limbs on the second through eighth thoracic segments, however the limbs on the first thoracic segment are smaller than the others, and are used as feeding limbs. The different pattern of Ubx expression correlates with these modifications, possibly a result of an acquired mutation that allows the Ubx enhancers to no longer mediate expression in the first thoracic segment.|$|E

Similarly, the ectopic expression of each of these <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> {{in the absence of the}} rest of BX-C products results in gene-specific segmen...|$|R

50|$|In 1977, a {{revolution}} in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, {{with the arrival of}} recombinant DNA technology in genetics, and the papers Ontogeny and Phylogeny by Stephen J. Gould and Evolution by Tinkering by François Jacob. Gould laid to rest Haeckel's interpretation of evolutionary embryology, while Jacob set out an alternative theory. This led to a second synthesis, at last including embryology as well as molecular genetics, phylogeny, and evolutionary biology to form evo-devo. In 1978, Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes that regulate embryonic development in Drosophila fruit flies, which like all insects are arthropods, one of the major phyla of invertebrate animals. Bill McGinnis quickly discovered <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later also found in fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.In 1980, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus described gap genes which help to create the segmentation pattern in fruit fly embryos; they and Lewis won a Nobel Prize for their work in 1995.|$|E
50|$|In Drosophila, long ncRNAs {{induce the}} {{expression}} of the <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene,</b> Ubx, by recruiting and directing the chromatin modifying functions of the trithorax protein Ash1 to Hox regulatory elements. Similar models have been proposed in mammals, where strong epigenetic mechanisms are thought to underlie the embryonic expression profiles of the Hox genes that persist throughout human development. Indeed, the human Hox genes are associated with hundreds of ncRNAs that are sequentially expressed along both the spatial and temporal axes of human development and define chromatin domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. One ncRNA, termed HOTAIR, that originates from the HOXC locus represses transcription across 40 kb of the HOXD locus by altering chromatin trimethylation state. HOTAIR is thought to achieve this by directing the action of Polycomb chromatin remodeling complexes in trans to govern the cells' epigenetic state and subsequent gene expression. Components of the Polycomb complex, including Suz12, EZH2 and EED, contain RNA binding domains that may potentially bind HOTAIR and probably other similar ncRNAs. This example nicely illustrates a broader theme whereby ncRNAs recruit the function of a generic suite of chromatin modifying proteins to specific genomic loci, underscoring the complexity of recently published genomic maps. Indeed, the prevalence of long ncRNAs associated with protein coding genes may contribute to localised patterns of chromatin modifications that regulate gene expression during development. For example, the majority of protein-coding genes have antisense partners, including many tumour suppressor genes that are frequently silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. A recent study observed an inverse expression profile of the p15 gene and an antisense ncRNA in leukaemia. A detailed analysis showed the p15 antisense ncRNA (CDKN2BAS) was able to induce changes to heterochromatin and DNA methylation status of p15 by an unknown mechanism, thereby regulating p15 expression. Therefore, misexpression of the associated antisense ncRNAs may subsequently silence the tumour suppressor gene contributing towards cancer.|$|E
40|$|We have {{analysed}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression in}} the embryonic visceral mesoderm of segmentation mutants by antibody staining against Ultrabithorax, Antennapedia and Sex combs reduced protein. We found that even-skipped (eve) function is crucially required for <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> expression, whereas most other segmentation mutations have only minor effects on position and/or width of the homeotic expression domains in this germ layer. Analysis of pair-rule double mutants indicates that complete loss of <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> activity in the visceral mesoderm, as observed in amorphic eve mutants, correlates with loss of engrailed (en) {{expression in the}} epidermis and loss of segmentation. We suggest that the establishment of parasegment borders, a consequence of eve expression and witnessed by subsequent en expression, is a necessary precondition for <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the visceral mesoderm...|$|E
40|$|In {{hermaphroditic}} Arabidopsis, the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) stimulates stamen {{development by}} opposing the DELLA repression of B and C classes of floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes.</b> GA can promote male flower formation in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), a typical monoecious vegetable with unisexual flowers, and the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we characterized a DELLA homolog CsGAIP in cucumber, {{and we found}} that CsGAIP is highly expressed in stem and male flower buds. In situ hybridization showed that CsGAIP is greatly enriched in the stamen primordia, especially during the hermaphrodite stage of flower development. Further, CsGAIP protein is located in nucleus. CsGAIP can partially rescue the plant height, stamen development and fertility phenotypes of Arabidopsis rga- 24 /gai-t 6 mutant, and ectopic expression of CsGAIP in wide-type Arabidopsis results in reduced number of stamens and decreased transcription of B class floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>genes</b> APETALA 3 (AP 3) and PISTILLATA (PI).

40|$|Each of the {{homeotic}} genes of the HOM or HOX complexes {{is expressed in}} a limited domain along the anterior-posterior axis. Each homeotic protein directs the formation of characteristic structures, such as wings or ribs.

We have identified genes that limit where the <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> Sex combs reduced (Scr) can affect cell fates in the Drosophila embryo.

40|$|During most of Drosophila {{development}} {{the regulation}} of <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription is controlled by two groups of regulatory genes, the trithorax group of activators and the Polycomb group of repressors. brahma (brm), {{a member of the}} trithorax group, encodes a protein related to the yeast SWI 2 /SNF 2 protein, a subunit of a protein complex that assists sequence-specific activator proteins by alleviating the repressive effects of chromatin. To learn more about the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the regulation of}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>gene</b> transcription, we have investigated whether a similar complex exists in flies. We identified the Drosophila snr 1 gene, a potential homologue of the yeast SNF 5 gene that encodes a subunit of the yeast SWI/SNF complex.
