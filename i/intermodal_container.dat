5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the three}} major ports on the West Coast of the United States, the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the fifth busiest {{container}} port in the United States. It was {{one of the}} earliest seaports to switch to containerization and to <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> transfer, thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s, the Port of Oakland began the evaluation of development of an <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> transfer capability, i.e., facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels to either trucks or rail modes.|$|E
25|$|International {{standards}} have made {{trade in goods}} and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the <b>intermodal</b> <b>container.</b> Containerization dramatically reduced transport of its costs, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. International Organization for Standardization is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.|$|E

25|$|Intermodal freight {{transport}} involves the transportation of freight in an <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (e.g.,rail, ship, and truck), without any {{handling of the}} freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling, and so improves security, reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking is the key benefit for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances.|$|E

25|$|Contship Overland was a {{division}} of Contship Containerlines operating {{at the forefront of}} Europe's intermodal industry. The company had offices in Felixstowe, Glasgow and Milan, and worked with partners in Spain and Greece, providing rail freight solutions to key markets and road freight options where required by customers. Its main business consisted of <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> and swapbody traffic between the UK and Italy, mostly by rail via the Channel Tunnel.

25|$|An <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> {{is a large}} {{standardized}} shipping container, {{designed and}} built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading their cargo. Intermodal containers are primarily used to store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global containerized intermodal freight transport system, but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight container, ISO container, shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex) box, sea or c can.|$|E

500|$|The Matterhorn is a {{subwoofer}} model {{completed in}} March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military {{request for a}} loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20Hz, and generate 94dB {{at a distance of}} , and more than 140dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15Hz sine wave tone at 140dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80Hz, and is down 3dB at 12Hz. It was built within an <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> [...] long and [...] square. The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier.

2500|$|In 1955, former {{trucking}} company owner Malcom McLean {{worked with}} engineer Keith Tantlinger {{to develop the}} modern <b>intermodal</b> <b>container.</b> The challenge was to design a shipping container that could efficiently be loaded onto ships and would hold securely on long sea voyages. The result was a [...] tall by [...] wide box in -long units constructed from [...] thick corrugated steel. The design incorporated a twistlock mechanism atop {{each of the four}} corners, allowing the container to be easily secured and lifted using cranes. After helping McLean create the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to industry; this began international standardization of shipping containers.|$|E
2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates <b>intermodal</b> <b>container</b> and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are highway truck trailers with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|E
