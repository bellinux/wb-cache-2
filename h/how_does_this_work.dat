5000|$|Although {{many older}} adults {{experience}} {{some level of}} deterioration in their cognitive abilities, new {{research has found that}} some older adults are better able to adapt to these potential changes through the application of a concept called [...] "cognitive reserve". Underlying this concept is the observation that the extent of brain pathology or brain damage does not correlate to clinical manifestations of a disease. In other words, cognitive reserve develops the ability to use alternative cognitive strategies in order to maximize or optimize performance on cognitive tasks. In essence, the relationship between neuropathology and clinical symptoms is not necessarily proportional. So, <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work?</b> Researchers have believed that the greater the education level achieved, the more neuropathology is necessary before clinical symptoms are experienced. Further, some researchers have believed also that academic achievement (rather than just education) is a very important factor. Others have concluded that frequent cognitive activity (such as playing chess or visiting a library) is also associated with creating a reduced risk for dementia. Still others, however, have focused on the level of social engagement (measured by size of a person's social network) as a main factor that creates such disparities. [...] When [...] "cognitive reserve" [...] exists, a person's executive function is enhanced. [...] Through this mechanism, a person is able to think with a greater amount of flexibility and function adaptively to novel environments. [...] For normative and preclinical persons, cognitive training can be extremely instrumental in a person's ability to successfully age.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explain the nature and {{strength}} of the latter-day status of Ştefan cel Mare in the republics of Romania and Moldova, {{and the history of}} his legacy. The regime and posthumous career of Ştefan cel Mare is examined through studies of history, politics and archaeology, set within the conceptual approach to nationalism that is known as “ethnosymbolism”. At the heart of this thesis lie the questions why does Ştefan cel Mare play a key role as a national symbol and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> in practice? These questions are addressed within an ethnosymbolist framework, which allows for the ethnosymbolist approach itself to be subjected to a critical study. There is a lacuna in many ethnosymbolist works, a space for a more detailed consideration of the place of archaeology in the development of nationalism. This thesis contends that the results of archaeological research can be included in a rounded ethnosymbolist study. First, the history of archaeological sites and monuments may contribute to understanding the way in which historically attested cultural symbols are adopted by communities over time. Secondly, if studied carefully, archaeological evidence may have the potential to trace the evolution of identity characteristics, in line with ethnosymbolism’s attempt to account for the formation of national identity in the pre-modern era...|$|E
40|$|Answers to questions: 1. What is the {{original}} contribution of this work? The novelty of our work consists in introducing a two-step PCA for extract-ing spectral eigenfeatures in ngerprints that can be eectively matched by Dynamic Programming (DP). 2. Why should this contribution be considered important? Our method can be embedded in small consumer devices such as laptops, PDA, USB keys due to its high accuracy and very compact representation of the ngerprint. It is suitable for small size line sensors as it requires very small region for feature extraction. 3. What is the most closely related work by others and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> dier? Matsumoto et al. proposed a ngerprint verication method based on Dy-namic Programming matching of spectral features. In this work, spectral features such as Linear Prediction Coecients (LPC) were extracted from each image line and matched with Dynamic Programming. Our work diers in proposing statistical analysis (PCA) for feature extrac-tion coupled with an eective way of applying DP matching for eigenfeatures. Applying DP matching for eigenfeatures is usually dicult due {{to the loss of}} topographical information during feature extraction. 4. How can other researchers make use of the results of this work?

40|$|Within {{feminist theory}} theory, {{as well as}} in other areas of thought, certain terms, {{hitherto}} rejected, bracketed or even forbidden are being reassessed and reanimated anew. ‘Ontology’, ‘materiality’, ‘evolution’ are being reasserted with an enthusiasm seeming contradiction with radical perspectives of the recent past. Of course, with such complex terms at stake, these reassessments are not all of the same ilk; nevertheless, it is remarkable that one now finds some of the most eminent feminist theorists engaged in explorations that would have been unthinkable fifteen years ago, even though much of the theoretical literature employed is much older than this, as the recent explorations of the work of Henri Bergson in the context of feminist theory testify (Grosz, 2004; 2005). What gives this literature its newness is how it reads now now, and, I would argue,, not least in a context where it is presented as a critique of the concept of performativity as it has come to be understood in feminist and cultural theory formativity theory.

40|$|Purpose – Involvement in {{creative}} practice is commonly regarded as “therapeutic” {{but what is}} actually meant by this and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work</b> promote social inclusion and mental well-being, particularly when performed in a group setting? Drawing {{on the findings of}} a research project called Clay Transformations (AHRC), {{the purpose of this paper}} is to consider these questions. The project involved running a series of clay workshops aimed at people with experience of mental health service use and those who work with them. Design/methodology/approach – In order to explore the significance of art involvement to people who use mental health services, qualitative research findings are presented. These are then linked to relevant literature in order to consider the way in which workshop participation helped to promote social inclusion and mental well-being. Findings – Many benefits were gained from workshop attendance deriving from involvement in the process and the outcome of art creation. These benefits were enhanced by the group context in which the work took place and the mutual support and interaction arising from this group membership. Originality/value – The recognition of the therapeutic value of creative practice has been accompanied by the emergence of the notion of “mutual recovery” which extends the concept of recovery beyond an individualised focus. The positive findings of this project uphold these developments and suggest that mental health practice should address the wider social contexts that can facilitate the promotion of mental well-being...|$|E

The focus {{of this study was to}} identify how the technical ordering in the department of Engine Services & Engine Assembly is working with Lean Production, which is a method of business development. By working closely with a range of people within the department, it has been possible to complete interviews, meetings, surveys, etc. this has led to that the problem formulation of the thesis have been processed in detail. Three issues have been addressed in this work. The questions are: How to work with Lean in a technology department and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work?</b> How to connect the technology department's planning boards with the master board, which is a comprehensive planning board, in an efficient way? Can the technology department contribute to a further improvement in Engine Services & Engine Assembly? The results of the study can be found in Chapter 5 of this report. This result plays an important role in Engine Services & Engine Assembly, as the introduction of Lean Production implies continuous improvement for the company. ii The final part of the report consists of a conclusion and a discussion. The conclusion that has been made is hoping that Engine Services & Engine Assembly continues with the work in future, as the company places great emphasis on improvement work.

Plant microbial fuel cells (Plant- MFCs) generate in-situ green electricity(Strik, Hamelers et al. 2008). <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>work?</b> By photosynthesis the plant is capturing solar energy which is transformed into chemical energy as organic matter. Easily 20 to 40 % of this organic matter is released via the plant roots into the bioanode of the microbial fuel cell. At the anode electrochemically active oxidise the organic matter while using the carbon anode electrode as final electron acceptor. The released electrons flow via energy harvester to the cathode were typically oxygen is reduced. Under Western European weather conditions a power output of 3. 2 W/m 2 is expected which is up to 10 times higher than conventional biomass electricity systems (Strik, Timmers et al. 2011). At this moment the Plant-MFCs long term power output is 50 mW/m 2 which is attractive for powering sensors or LEDs (Timmers, Strik et al. 2010). To achieve more plantpower larger areas are needed. Plants in Plant-MFCs grown under waterlogged conditions to support the preferred conditions in the anode.

It is worthwhile to reflect on how shockingly little of the energy we procure from a source like a wellhead or a coal mine actually gets applied in terms of useful work—driving cars, turning on lights, heating homes. The dismaying reality of inefficiencies all along the supply chain means that we throw away most of the energy we secure at the source. But if we reverse that process, we can see how little energy we actually need to conserve {{in order to save}} large amounts of primary energy like coal, wind, or oil.

But <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> ecosystem <b>work</b> and what changes it over time? These questions are explored in this paper, using some of the insights of Schumpeterian evolutionary economics. To summarise, it is shown that innovation, the endogenous creation of new knowledge in the ecosystem, emerges from six key symbiotic relationships. These relationships are shaped both by competition and by institutions which include financial institutions, regulation and competition law, standardisation and universities. It is these processes of innovation that make the New ICT Ecosystem the restless, incessantly changing system that it is.
