40|$|The {{standard}} NACE MR 0175 (ISO 15156) {{requires a}} maximum hardness value of 23 HRC for 13 Cr- 4 Ni-(Mo) steel grade for sour service, requiring a <b>double</b> <b>tempering</b> heat treatment at {{temperature in the}} range 648 – 691 °C for the first tempering and 593 – 621 °C for the second tempering. Difficulties in limiting alloy hardness after the tempering of forged mechanical components (F 6 NM) are often faced. Variables affecting the thermal behavior of 13 Cr- 4 Ni-(Mo) during single and <b>double</b> <b>tempering</b> treatments have been studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, X-ray diffraction measurements, dilatometry, and thermo-mechanical simulations. It {{has been found that}} relatively low Ac 1 temperatures in this alloy induce the formation of austenite phase above 600 °C during tempering, and that the formed, reverted austenite tends to be unstable upon cooling, thus contributing to the increase of final hardness via transformation to virgin martensite. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the Ac 1 temperature as much as possible to allow the tempering of martensite at the temperature range required by NACE without the detrimental formation of virgin martensite upon final cooling. Attempts to do so have been carried out by reducing both carbon (< 0. 02 % C) and nitrogen (< 100 ppm) levels.

40|$|This {{material}} X 38 CrMoV 5 - 1 is an {{alloyed steel}} used for hot working, with good toughness and high resistance to thermal shock. The presence of Cr, Mo and V gives this steel a high resistance to wear, keeping its hardness properties at high temperature. Cr and Mo delay softening annealing and inhibit the grain growth. The great resistance to high temperatures {{of this type}} of steels is related with an easy martensitic transformation. This transformation happens even at low cooling speeds. The properties of these types of martensitic steels result as a consequence of their complex microstructure that is obtained by an extremely controlled thermal treatment. Dilatometric testing was performed on continuous cooling from austenization temperature (1050 ºC). This testing shows the high hardenability {{of this type of}} steels. ATD studies have been done to complement the dilatometric testing.

The mechanical properties caused by each heat treatment were then measured through hardness and tensile testing. The average yield strength produced through austempering was less than that produced through the current heat treatment or through cryogenically processing. The cryogenically processed and control samples had statistically similar yield strength values, which is likely due to the difference in retained austenite between the two sample groups being relatively small...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{practice}} of tempering for stress relief before cryogenic thermal treatment in an AISI D 2 tool steel {{has been shown}} to stabilize the retained austenite, nullifying the effect of cryogenic treatment The practice simultaneously enhances the wear resistance of the steel after complete thermal cycling (quench + stress relief + cryogenic treatment + <b>double</b> <b>temper).</b> Cryogenic treatment {{has been shown to}} have a large effect on the properties of heat treated steels, especially tool steels. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of some parts it is necessary to do a prior stress relief heat treatment to avoid cracks and catastrophic failures. In previous work [1] it was verified that the stress relief treatment stabilizes the austenite even when the sample is submerged in liquid nitrogen. The literature [2] suggests that there is a C-curve kinetic behavior for the austenite to martensite transformation at temperatures lower than Ms. In order to confirm those previous work results[1] and test the hypothesis of a C-curve behavior, samples from an AISI D 2 tool steel bar were austenitized at 1040 °C for 40 minutes and then quenched in oil. Half of the samples were submitted to a stress relief treatment at 130 °C for 90 minutes in order to enable comparison between samples with and without stress relief.

Prior to the welding, the material was <b>double</b> <b>tempered</b> at 538 C (1, 000 F). After welding, only part of the material was stress relieved at 510 C (950 F) for 3 h. Round tensile specimens obtained from nonstress-relieved material were tested in 100 -percent relative humidity at 38 C (100 F), in 3. 5 -percent NaCl alternate immersion, and in 5 -percent salt spray at 35 C (95 F). Specimens obtained from stress-relieved material were tested in alternate immersion. The stress levels were 50, 75, and 90 percent of the corresponding 0. 2 -percent yield strength (YS). All the nonstress-relieved specimens exposed to salt spray and alternate immersion failed. Stress-relieved specimens (exposed to alternate immersion) failed at 75 and 90 percent of YS. No failures occurred at 50 percent of YS in the stress-relieved specimens which indicates a beneficial effect of the stress relief on the SCC resistance of these welds.

The steels examined {{during the course of this}} examination conform in composition to medium-carbon AISI type 420 martensitic stainless steel, except for the addition of 0. 13 % vanadium and 0. 62 % molybdenum to one of the alloys. The effect of various austenitising and tempering heat treatments was examined. Steel samples were austenitised at temperatures between 1000 °C and 1200 °C, followed by quenching in oil. The as-quenched microstructures were found to range from almost fully martensitic structures to martensite with up to 35 % retained austenite after quenching, with varying amounts of carbide precipitates. The influence of tempering, <b>double</b> <b>tempering,</b> and sub-zero treatment was investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the as-quenched microstructures, and X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to identify the carbide present in the as-quenched structures and to quantify the retained austenite contents. Hardness tests were performed to determine the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties. As-quenched hardness values ranged from 700 HV to 270 HV, depending on the amount of retained austenite. Thermodynamic predictions (using the CALPHAD™ model) were used to explain these microstructures based on the solubility of the carbide particles in the matrix at various austenitising temperatures. The carbide particles were found to be mainly in the form of M 7 C 3 at elevated temperatures, transforming to M 23 C 6 on cooling. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

Retained austenite transformed into martensite on cooling from the tempering temperature. Specimens that were austenitised at 1050 °C or 1075 °C and tempered twice contained fresh martensite.

40|$|The High and Thermal Magnetic Processing/Electro-magnetic Acoustic Transducer (HTMP/EMAT) {{technology}} {{has been shown to}} be an enabling disruptive materials processing technology, that can achieve significant improvements in microstructure and consequently material performance beyond that achievable through conventional processing, and will lead to the next generation of advanced performance structural and functional materials. HTMP exposure increased the reaction kinetics enabling refinement of microstructural features such as finer martensite lath size, and finer, more copious, homogeneous dispersions of strengthening carbides leading to combined strength and toughness improvements in bainitic steels. When induction heating is applied in a high magnetic field environment, the induction heating coil is configured so that high intensity acoustic/ultrasonic treatment occurs naturally. The configuration results in a highly effective electromagnetic acoustical transducer (EMAT). HTMP combined with applying high-field EMAT, produce a non-contact ultrasonic treatment that can be used to process metal alloys in either the liquid state resulting in significant microstructural changes over conventional processing. Proof-of-principle experiments on cast irons resulted in homogeneous microstructures in small castings along with improved casting surface appearance. The experiment showed that by exposing liquid metal to the non-contact acoustic/ultrasonic processing technology developed using HMFP/EMAT wrought-like microstructures were developed in cast components. This Energy Intensive Processes (EIP) project sponsored by the DOE EERE Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) demonstrated the following: (1) The reduction of retained austenite in high carbon/high alloy steels with an ambient temperature HTMP process, replacing either a cryogenic or <b>double</b> <b>tempering</b> thermal process normally employed to accomplish retained austenite transformation. HTMP can be described as a 'heat-free', heat treating technology. Lower residual stresses in HTMP treated materials are anticipated since no thermal strains are involved in inducing the transformation of retained austenite to martensite in high alloy steel. (2) The simultaneous increase of 12 % in yield strength and 22 % in impact energy in a bainitic alloy using HTMP processing. This is a major breakthrough in materials processing for the next generation of structural materials since conventionally processed materials show a reduction in impact toughness with an increase in yield strength. HTMP is a new paradigm to beneficially increase both yield strength and impact energy absorption simultaneously. (3) HTMP processing refined both the martensite lath population and the carbide dispersion in a bainitic steel alloy during Gausstempering. The refinement was believed to be responsible for the simultaneous increase in strength and toughness. Hence, HTMP significantly impacts nucleation and growth phenomenon. (4) HTMP processing developed comparable ultimate tensile strength and twice the impact energy in a lower cost, lower alloy content ({approx} 8 % alloy content) steel, compared to highly alloyed, (31 % alloy elements involving Ni, Co, and Mo) 250 -grade margining steel. Future low-cost HTMP alloys appear viable that will exceed the structural performance of highly alloyed materials that are conventionally processed. This economic benefit will enable U. S. industry to reduce cost (better more competitive worldwide) while maintaining or exceeding current performance. (5) EMAT processed cast iron exhibits significantly higher hardness (by 51 % for a 9 T condition) than a no-field processed sample. (6) EMAT produced microstructures in cast iron resulted in an unique graphite nodule morphology, a modified pearlite content, and unique carbide types, that formed during solidification and cooling. (7) EMAT processed nanoparticle dispersions in Mg resulted in a very fine, unagglomerated distribution of the nanoparticles in the magnesium matrix. This provides a breakthrough technology to make the next generation of nanocomposite reinforced metal matrix composites which can be tailored to exhibit higher strength and ductility combinations not only at ambient temperature but at elevated temperatures where enhanced creep resistance is observed. This technology can be extended to non-metallic systems as long as a conductive containment vessel is utilized that will convey the EMAT signal into the material of interest during processing.

Two technology limitations were overcome that led to the first generation commercial prototype HTMP/EMAT system which was initially installed at ORNL.

40|$|Supermartensitic {{stainless}} steel pipelines {{are used in}} {{the oil and gas industry}} mainly to transport oil and gas products from wells to offshore installations or even to shore. Most of these pipes are installed by the reeling process, involving up to 3 % plastic strain of the pipe wall during installation. Supermartensitic {{stainless steel}}s are a relatively new group of alloys that contain 11 - 13 % chromium, 2 - 6. 5 % nickel and 0 - 2. 5 % molybdenum. They contain less than 0. 015 % carbon. In comparison, more common martensitic stainless steels contain 0. 1 - 0. 2 % carbon. The decreased carbon content increases the weldability of the steel by reducing the hardness in the heat affected zone and reducing carbide precipitation. This work has investigated the most typical failure mode of supermartensitic stainless steel pipelines in the oil and gas industry. Published results of failure investigations have revealed that this failure mode is hydrogen induced cracking in the weld coarse grained heat affected zone. The hydrogen source is either weld consumables or hydrogen developed on the steel surface because of the negative potential induced by the cathodic protection system. In the latter instance, the cracks have typically appeared in the toe of the fillet weld that attaches the sacrificial anode connection doubler plate (anode pad) to the pipe wall. The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of the microstructure on the hydrogen cracking susceptibility of two typical pipeline supermartensitic stainless steels. The work has concentrated on the coarse-grained heat affected zone because this is the typical crack initiation point. The hydrogen cracking susceptibility was tested by tensile testing notched steel samples under varying conditions. Three different sets of tensile tests have been carried out. All specimens were subjected to weld heat affected zone simulation using a Smitweld simulator. All samples were first heated to a temperature close to the melting temperature in order to create a microstructure that is typical of the coarse-grained heat affected zone. Some samples were also subjected to a second heat cycle representing an adjacent second weld pass. The peak temperature of this second heat cycle was varied. The tensile test samples were machined after simulation with a 1 mm deep notch in the simulated zone. Two different materials were used throughout the testing, designated steel A and B. Both were rich grade supermartensitic stainless steels typical of the pipeline steels used in the North Sea. The distinct difference between them is that steel A is alloyed with titanium in order to avoid selective corrosion along previous austenite grain boundaries, while steel B is not alloyed with titanium. The first set of samples were tested without any influence of hydrogen and monitored during testing in order to investigate any tendency of local cracking during straining. After the tensile tests these samples were subjected to light microscopy and hardness testing in order to characterise the microstructure of each sample. The second peak temperature was found to have an impact on hardness. A second heat cycle to 500 - 550 oC resulted in an increase in hardness; while a second heat cycle to 625 - 650 oC decreased the hardness. The second set of samples were charged with hydrogen in 3. 5 %NaCl electrolyte prior to tensile testing in order to investigate the tendency for hydrogen embrittlement from hydrogen present in the material prior to straining. This is similar to the case in which hydrogen is introduced through the welding process, and the pipe is installed by reeling at a later stage. The tensile testing was performed at a slow rate (10 - 6 s- 1) in order to allow for the necessary hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip to achieve stepwise hydrogen cracking. A significant reduction in ductility compared to samples without hydrogen was observed. The third set of samples were tested under constant load immersed in 3. 5 % NaCl and subjected to a negative potential corresponding to that induced by the cathodic protection system. The load was increased by a small amount every second day in order to establish the threshold stress for hydrogen cracking during service in seawater with hydrogen being introduced on the steel surface by the cathodic protection system. A significant influence of the second heat cycle was observed. This effect was attributed to both a variation in yield strength and the influence of precipitates on hydrogen solubility and diffusion. Supermartensitic stainless steels contain a certain amount of retained austenite, and this is regarded as beneficial because it increases toughness and ductility. The retained austenite is produced intentionally in pipe products by heat treatment at a temperature where the alloy is partially transformed to austenite, normally 600 - 700 oC. The tendency to form retained austenite in the two materials was investigated by heat treatment of samples at different temperatures and time. Phase transformation temperatures were measured by dilatometer tests and X-Ray diffraction. The highest amount of retained austenite was achieved after a <b>double</b> <b>tempering</b> heat cycle, and the formation of retained austenite required longer heat treatment times in steel A than in steel B. Retained austenite may play a role in the hydrogen embrittlement process because austenite has a much higher hydrogen solubility than martensite has. The effect of the retained austenite on hydrogen cracking was investigated by tensile testing of standard round bar specimens that had been heat treated in order to achieve different levels of retained austenite. A significant effect of the retained austenite was observed. Samples with high amounts of retained austenite experienced a much higher reduction in ductility after hydrogen charging than samples with low amounts of retained austenite. In order to explain this effect, the hydrogen solubility of samples containing different levels of austenite and precipitates was measured. This was achieved by charging the samples to saturation in an electrolyte and performing hydrogen analysis. Carbide precipitation was also found to influence hydrogen solubility, and carbides precipitated at different temperatures were identified by transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|Since {{the late}} nineties {{weldable}} supermartensitic stainless steels (SMSS) {{has been used}} in subsea flowlines, and more than 400 km is installed. Hydrogen related problems in the weld fabrication stage or hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) due to hydrogen embrittlement under cathodic protection have been reported and testing to better understand the behavior of these materials is of interest. The present work is focusing on the effect of double heat cycles on carbide precipitation and secondary hardening in two high grade SMSS, one alloyed with Ti and one not (0. 007 % Ti). The experimental work included heat treatment of both steels in single and double cycles in both oven and in induction heating weld simulator. All specimens were heated to 1000 degrees celsius for 30 min to austenize the material and air cooled before simulating second heat cycles of 1 - 60 min in the temperature range 500 - 600 degrees celsius. The microstructures resulting from the heat treatments were characterized by standard metallographic techniques, hardness testing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results from hardness testing show a secondary hardening effect in both steels for all temperatures tested, with a maximum for samples treated at 550 degrees celsius. For all samples there was also a significant drop in hardness from the hardness of the single cycle sample to the 1 min <b>tempered</b> <b>double</b> cycle samples. From investigation in TEM it was found that, in the steel alloyed with titanium TiC precipitate during tempering and in the steel not alloyed with titanium Cr 23 C 6 precipitate during tempering at 550. The difference in secondary hardening found is explained by the difference in carbide precipitation mechanism. In the steel alloyed with titanium a higher secondary hardening effect was found. No carbide precipitation was found in the single cycle heat treated state of the steels. </p...|$|R
