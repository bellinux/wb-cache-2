40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of € 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite dredged spoil samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 ± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 ± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 ± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 ± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 ± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 ± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %).

40|$|Aim and Background. In {{the process}} of {{creating}} safe navigable waterways for oil exploitation, the companies operating in the Niger Delta generate tons of sulfidic spoils. These are often deposited over bank, mostly upon fringing mangroves, and abandoned. This leads to a myriad of environmental problems. The extent of these impacts is not exactly known, but was inferred from the activities of oil companies operating in the area. This paper describes the impacts following the disturbance of sulfidic sediment through dredging and by subsequent poor spoil management practices. Environmental impacts of exposed and abandoned sulfidic sediments. The practice of dumping and abandoning sulfidic <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> along canal banks triggers a series of environmental problems leading to extreme acidification, heavy metal pollution, and general habitat degradation which prevent the re-colonization of the sites by native species. The resultant spoil dumps remain bare for several years and they become colonized by invasive species later. Later still they may become attractive to the local population as sites for houses, fishing camps and home gardens, which is nevertheless regarded as a positive impact. Management of abandoned sulfidic spoil dumps. As a panacea to environmental problems caused by the sulfidic spoils, they need to be properly handled to prevent their acidification. This should be followed by mangrove restoration to pristine conditions or rehabilitation to other beneficial uses. Conclusion and Recommendation. The abandoned sulfidic spoils in the Niger Delta have resulted in the death of several thousands of hectares of mangrove habitat and their associated biota. Despite the increasing scale of dredging and spoil abandonment, the accompanying problems have been recognized by neither the oil companies nor by national government. This paper attempts to highlight these problems and concludes by recommending sound spoil management strategies involving the handling, restoration and rehabilitation of impacted areas. Furthermore, possible beneficial use of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> for civil construction, beach nourishment / shoreline protection is identified. The Nigerian Government needs to promulgate and enforce laws that will permit the sustainable use of mangrove resources...|$|E

The influence of the settling behavior of soil particles in clay-water slurry on the homogeneity and consolidation properties of the final sediment were assessed in the current study. Standard one-dimensional and radial consolidation tests were conducted on Port of Brisbane dredged mud, which was remolded at various water contents and salt concentrations and reconstituted. Particle-size distribution curves show the various degrees of segregation that occurred during settlement of soil particles in flocculated and dispersed slurry, prepared and placed in saltwater and freshwater environments, respectively. The vertical and horizontal consolidation coefficients (cv, ch) and the vertical permeability (kv) {{were found to be}} fairly uniform throughout the flocculated sediment, whereas for the dispersed sediment significant variation could be observed at various depth levels. The consolidation properties in the horizontal direction (ch, kh) were considerably larger than in the vertical direction (cv, kv) for both the flocculated and dispersed sediment. The degree of anisotropy in the consolidation coefficient, measured by ch/cv, was generally larger for the flocculated sediment than for the dispersed sediment. Proper understanding of the consolidation process and the variability of the consolidation and permeability coefficients with depth is important for the reliable prediction of settlement and the degree of consolidation achieved in the reclamation fill...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact and recovery {{associated with the}} long and uninterrupted disposal of large volumes of moderately contaminated dredged material from the port of Rotterdam was studied at nearby dumping sites in the North Sea. Observations were made on sediment contamination, ecotoxicity, biomarker responses and benthic community changes shortly after dumping at the 'North' site had ceased and {{at the start of}} disposal at the new dumping site 'Northwest'. During the period of dumping, very few benthic invertebrates were found at the North site. Concentrations of cadmium, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tributyltin (TBT) in the fine sediment fraction (< 63 mum) from this site were 2 - 3 times higher than at the reference site. In four different bioassays with marine invertebrates the sediments showed no acute toxic effects. In tissue (pyloric caeca) of resident starfish Asterias rubens, residual levels of mercury, zinc, PCBs and dioxin-like activity were never more than twice those at the reference site. Four different biomarkers (DNA integrity, cytochrome P 450 content, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibition) were used on the starfish tissues, but {{no significant differences were found}} between North and the reference site. Minor pathological effects were observed in resident dab Limanda limanda. One year after dumping had ceased at the North site, a significant increase in the species richness and abundance of benthic invertebrates and a concomitant decrease in the fine sediment fraction of the seabed were observed. After 8. 2 million m(3) of moderately contaminated dredged material had been dumped at the new dumping site Northwest, the species richness and abundance of benthic invertebrates declined over an area extending about 1 - 2 km eastwards. This correlated with a shift in sediment texture from sand to silt. The contamination of the fine sediment fraction at the Northwest location doubled. It is concluded that marine benthic resources at and around the dumping sites have been adversely affected by physical disturbance (burial, smothering). However, no causal link could be established with sediment-associated contaminants from the <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Sediment-laden {{turbulent}} buoyant jets {{are commonly}} {{encountered in the}} natural and man-made environments. Examples of sediment-laden buoyant jets include volcanic eruptions, deep ocean hydrothermal vents (“black smokers”), ocean dumping of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> and sludge, and submarine discharge of wastewater effluent. It {{is important to understand}} the fluid mechanics of sediment jets for environmental impact assessment, and yet there is currently no general model for predicting the mixing of sediment-laden jets. This study reports a theoretical and experimental investigation the sediment mixing, fall-out and deposition from sediment-laden buoyant jets. It is well known that turbulence generates fluctuations to the particle motion, modulating the particle settling velocity. A general three-dimensional (3 D) stochastic particle tracking model is developed to predict the particle settling out and deposition from a sediment-laden jet. Particle velocity fluctuations are modelled by a Lagrangian velocity autocorrelation function that accounts for the loitering and trapping of sediment particles in turbulent eddies which results in the reduction of settling velocity. The model is validated against results of independent experimental studies. Consistent with basic experiments using grid-generated turbulence, the model predicts that the apparent settling velocity can be reduced by as much as 30 % of the stillwater settling velocity. The mixing and deposition of sediment-laden horizontal momentum jets are studied using laboratory experiments and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling. It is shown that there is a significant settling velocity reduction up to about 25 - 35 %, dependent on jet turbulent fluctuations and particle properties. The CFD approach necessitates an ad hoc adjustment/reduction on settling velocity and lacks generality. Using classical solutions of mean velocity, and turbulent fluctuation and dissipation rate profiles derived from CFD solutions, 3 D particle tracking model predictions of sediment deposition and concentration profiles are in excellent agreement with measured data over a wide range of jet flow and particle properties. Unlike CFD calculations, the present method does not require any a priori adjustment of particle settling velocity. A general particle tracking model for predicting sediment fall-out and deposition from an arbitrarily inclined buoyant jets in stagnant ambient is successfully developed. The model incorporates the three flow regimes affecting the sediment dynamics in a buoyant jet, namely turbulent jet flow, jet entrainment-induced external flow and surface spreading current. The jet mean flow velocity is determined using a well-validated jet integral model. The external jet-induced irrotational flow field is computed by a distribution of point sinks along the jet trajectory. The surface spreading current is predicted using an integral model accounting for the interfacial shear. The model is validated against experimental data of sediment deposition from vertical and horizontal sediment-laden buoyant jets. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
