2500|$|No cricket {{had come}} from Swabi before and Junaid Khan didn't take {{interest}} in cricket initially, he played with tape-ball & was introduced to hard ball set up by his cousin. At 16 years age Junaid Khan was measured as the fastest bowler in the NWFP Twenty/20 competition. Junaid Khan said, [...] "Some of my team mates suggested that I should go for the Under 17 trials Abbottabad. I was in two minds but afterwards <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> that I attended the trials, as Ehteshamuddin spotted {{me and told me}} that I had potential and that I should go to Lahore".|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I {{had been}} afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later {{explained}} [...] "I couldn't even go out {{the front}} of my house because there were all these girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully … but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went". The last single he played on was [...] "Child's Play", which was a No.5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet's new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning [...] "Howzat" [...] (1976), the band's only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song's success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. [...] "Howzat" [...] went to numberone in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top10 hit in several European countries – including numberfour on the UK Singles Chart, numbersix in The Netherlands, and numbereight in Norway. It reached the top10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No.61 on the Billboard Hot100. The album of the same name also made No.1 in Australia, No.12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.|$|E

6000|$|He {{bowed and}} went on. [...] "It is {{hereditary}} in our house, and I hold {{the position of}} genius till <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>relieved.</b> For example, when the family want to dig up the buried treasure under the old bridge, I thunder and lighten and cause such a storm that they desist." ...|$|R
