500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellen Marie Hawkins, in Relate magazine, commented: [...] "There's an {{excitement}} to this music, and ... I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was being whisked off with limitless energy, {{eager to see}} one thing and then just as quickly, experience another. ... I was smiling and I was dancing, and I was living through this music." [...] As with her earlier recordings and many of her performances, Bear donates a portion of all proceeds to charity. In July 2013 {{she was part of}} a few Quincy Jones 80th birthday concerts in Montreux, Switzerland, Seoul, South Korea and in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, Pisces V and {{her sister}} vessel Pisces IV {{discovered}} a Japanese midget submarine; sunk on December 7, 1941 by the destroyer [...] in the first American shots fired in World War II, the submarine {{was hit by a}} 4"/50caliber gun shot and depth charged shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The submarine was found in [...] of water about [...] off the mouth of Pearl Harbor. This was the culmination of a 61-year search for the vessel and has been called [...] "the most significant modern marine archeological find ever in the Pacific, second only to the finding of Titanic in the Atlantic". In 2003, Pisces V visited the Japanese midget submarine it had found in Pearl Harbor the year before. The U.S. State Department worked in conjunction with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to determine Japanese wishes regarding the fate of the midget submarine. The submersibles are used by HURL as teaching devices. In 2008, two members of the Tampa Bay Chapter of SCUBAnauts were invited to team with HURL and to visit the historic wreck of the Japanese submarine. One SCUBAnaut said as he stepped on Pisces V that [...] "it looked and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in a space shuttle preparing for lift-off".|$|E

2500|$|Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was {{the top-ranked}} country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv. [...] Israel was {{represented}} by Ram, Erlich, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy. [...] Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8). [...] The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: [...] "With all due respect, Israel was lucky {{to get to the}} quarterfinals." [...] The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. [...] Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match. [...] Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5. [...] Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well." [...] The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. [...] The next day Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. [...] "I started to cry like a little boy", said Ram. [...] Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a [...] "thrilling" [...] win. [...] Captain Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. [...] With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were [...] "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Ram said: [...] "We have all grown up together since the age of 14. The reason we are in the semis is because we are a united team." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E

60|$|As my old chum {{approached}} {{to greet me}} on the lawn before breakfast the day following, I could not help admiring his fine, tall, athletic figure.
