As an abstract data type, the specifications of <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> of queue are separated from the implementation. Queue is a linear structure, which can be defined and implemented using different linear structures, like list, array etc Using the abstract data type, list to implement a queue implies using <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> of <b>the</b> abstract data type, list to design <b>the</b> algorithms <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> of <b>the</b> abstract data type, queue. This paper uses the ADT, list to present two variants of the abstract data type, queue.

5|$|Montagu {{selected}} the code name Mincemeat {{from a list}} of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to cooperate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} was also substantially {{reinforced by the}} addition of 1,200 men of the Glider Pilot Regiment, providing Urquhart with the equivalent of two battalions of infantry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> Smaller additions included a Dutch commando team and American communications teams.

5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that the operation would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating the need <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when the operation was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. The operation was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained.
