5000|$|Fatsia japonica, {{known as}} Fatsi or Japanese aralia (also {{occasionally}} as glossy-leaved paper plant, <b>false</b> <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plant,</b> fig-leaf palm), is a shrub growing to 3-6 m tall. The leaves have 7-9 broad lobes, divided to half or {{two-thirds of the}} way {{to the base of the}} leaf; the lobes are edged with coarse, blunt teeth. It is native to southern Japan. The name [...] "Fatsi" [...] is older Japanese, meaning 'eight' (in present-day Japanese hachi), referring to the eight lobes. In Japanese, it is called Yatsude meaning [...] "eight hand". The name 'Japanese Aralia" [...] is due to the genus formerly being classified within a broader interpretation of the related genus Aralia in the past (synonyms include Aralia japonica and Aralia sieboldii). It is a popular garden shrub in areas where winters do not fall below about -15 °C.|$|E

During the occupation, the Japanese government also made the same program for the community to overcome economic crisis in South Sulawesi. Today, such program has been taken as an example by the government of Indonesia in supporting the people to overcome the global energy crisis. The hazy view about Japan {{as the result of the}} Second World War, which tends to be negative and worse perception, now has been changed and many Japanese government policies taken as examples by Indonesian government such as: agricultural intensification, cotton and <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>planting</b> and mulberry. The statement such as ??? Japanese is brutal??? although they have been colonizing Indonesia for 3. 5 years, its brutality was comparable with the Dutch whom has been colonizing for 350 years. Although this statement has been written in National History of Indonesia nowadays, it is actually not so true since we focused to only the negative aspects rather than the positive aspects such as to how to overcome the economic crsisis. The economic activities of Japan in South Sulawesi in 1940 s were more intensive, not only in trading sector as indicated by the establishment of commercial ship namely : Nippon Yusen Kaisha, 0 saka Shosen Kaisha dan Noorsche Wilh, but also in mining, agriculture, fishery, even in industrial sector such as: textile, silk and <b>castor</b> <b>oil.</b> Basically, <b>planting</b> of cotton, <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> and mulberry was aimed at coping with the shortage of clothes in South Sulawesi as a result of textile and petroleum trading and even every things sent to Makassar blockaded by the allied forces.

A anÃlise dos dados permitiu identificar o perfil dos produtores de mamona e das tÃcnicas usadas na produÃÃo. Conclui-se entÃo, que a propensÃo do agricultor a plantar mamona estÃ sendo influenciada pela Ãrea, renda agrÃcola, renda total, financiamento, participaÃÃo em associaÃÃo e na credibilidade do programa.

The <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> (Ricinus communis L.) is a fast growing plant with high biomass production and is a potential phytoaccumulator of several metals. In recent years, the federal government of Brazil has encouraged <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> cultivation for biodiesel and bioethanol production. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytoextraction potential of R. communis L. and the effect of organic matter addition (peat vs. filter cake) to a soil contaminated with scrap metal residue containing heavy metals and boron. The experiment consisted of a completely randomized block design with two organic matter sources and four rates of amendment (0, 20, 40 and 80 Mgha- 1 organic carbon). Treatments were replicated three times. The <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> were harvested 74 days after sowing.

METHODS: Twenty rabbits (New Zealand) were submitted to a standard femoral condilar defect, with dimensions of 6 x 10 mm, and ramdomly assigned for implantation of autogenous bone graft in one side and <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> <b>plant</b> polyurethane in the other. The animals were observed for a period of 45 and 90 days. Evaluation of the macro and microscopic studies were analysed with statistical tests (p < 0. 05). RESULTS: Macroscopic analysis showed that the presence of femoral fractures were not significant in both groups. In all autogenous bone grafts there were the presence of cortical healing (p = 0. 0010), at 45 and at 90 days, while in the femurs that received polyurethane, this healing was absent at 45 days. Regarding the presence of ripe bone in the transition area between the implant and the receiving bone, the microscopic observation showed that it was completely absent, at 45 days.
