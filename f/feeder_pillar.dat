5000|$|In 1905 John Reid Dick, a {{businessman}} and qualified electrical engineer, was headhunted {{to join the}} business as managing director and the company began winning contracts in the electrical industry for street lighting posts, <b>feeder</b> <b>pillars</b> and fuse boxes. Expansion in this market continued and between {{the two world wars}} the company cemented its reputation as a switchgear and electrical engineering firm, although the foundry played a complementary part, continuing to supply castings and other products to established markets. Switchgear and components used in secondary power distribution such as ring main units, remain a significant revenue stream more than 100 years on. The company expanded its focus to include overseas markets in the late 1960s and began selling products into the Middle East market, which remains a key destination of Lucy Electric products and services.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} that an electric power is economically transferred over the grid system with maximum efficiency and reliability at virtually fixed {{voltage and frequency}} to consumers, it becomes imperative to carry out power flow studies. This study presents a model of an electrical distribution grid on a computer system for simulation. Hence the research work models and simulates a distribution grid using the “ETAPS” software. By making {{a model of the}} distribution network, the value of real and reactive powers and voltage magnitudes in the whole network can be observed. The simulation results obtained from the existing condition of 33 -kV Ota transmission network and the 11 / 0. 415 -kV Yusuf and Abule-Iroko injection substations indicate that 15 <b>feeder</b> <b>pillars</b> have low voltage violations. To solve the problem of voltage violations, shunt capacitor compensators were placed at affected locations, resulting in a network with improved voltageprofil...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of streetlights {{by the power}} utility company and local authorities are typically faced {{with the problem of}} high operational expenditure, low efficiency and increase customer complaint. They are also faced with increase customer complaint due to unattended faulty streets lights and frequent power outages. There is a significant pressure to reduce these operational expenses, improve efficiency and image. By operational efficiency we meant how faulty street lights are managed effectively {{through the use of a}} low cost automated system, thus improve efficiency and enhancing customer services. Operational cost reduction is achieved through accurately identification of faulty lights and timely action taken to rectify such fault. Currently these maintenance routines [i. e. random patrols around the street light zones] are conducted daily in parallel to records of faulty lights reported by customers. These incurred substantially high operational expenditure year to year. The objective of this project is to develop a low cost SLM system with features suffice enough for the utility companies to effectively manage and maintain street lights and also monitor power quality to ensure continuous and uninterrupted supply to customers both residential and industries. SLMS consist of interface modules (FC-Feeder Controller, FIU-Feeder Interface Units) installed at the substation or streetlights panel to collect the status of power over each <b>feeder</b> <b>pillar.</b> Information of faulty lights collected by the FIU (which will measure the current/power on the feeder and record any changes e. g. a drop in power indicating a faulty light in that feeder line) is passed back to FC using the PLC (Power line carrier) technique. The FC manages several feeder pillars and relay back the information received from FIU to a management system server located at the office (RCC-Regional Control Center & NCCNational Control Center) using GSM network. RCC then sends an alert SMS to operational personnel to inform them of the faulty record. The management system keeps records for management reporting and analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{viability}} of fixed type power capacitors for loss reduction in low voltage (400 V) distribution networks of power utilities was studied. Usually, reactive {{power of the}} load is compensated at high voltage levels by utility operators, which requires high investment on equipment. This study reveals an alternative low cost reactive power compensation method, which will reduce the capacity requirements of HV reactive power installations. Fixed type power capacitors had been used at the secondary of few of earlier 11 kV/ 415 V distribution transformers in Colombo City distribution system. Most of these units are in operation, even after 20 years of service. But the practice of having fixed capacitors at distribution transformers was not continued thereafter. It was identified through model simulation and field measurements that installation of fixed value power capacitors at feeder pillars of the power distribution network is more economical compared to the earlier practice in Colombo City. The expected minimum energy saving is approximately 300 kWh/month with a 40 kvar, 440 V rated capacitor installed at the <b>feeder</b> <b>pillar.</b> The main advantages of the proposal are low capital requirement and shorter payback period. The expected maximum payback period is 7 months. In the proposed method, the temperature of operation of capacitors was more critical. The reliability of capacitors is to ensure by adapting measures to reduce the operating temperature of capacitor units, housed in steel enclosures. Encloses, housing capacitor units reduces the case temperature of capacitors. This arrangement was superior {{to the use of}} outdoor type capacitors without enclosures. Use of light coloured enclosure with holes for ventilation and thermal insulation will reduce the temperature of operation of capacitor unit at least by 10 oC, compared to dark green finished enclosure with louvers for ventilation and without thermal insulation on the internal surface. Field measurements confirmed that the lifetime of capacitors are not affected due to load harmonics. The maximum harmonic current absorbed by capacitors was 50 % lower than the continuous over current rating of the capacitor unit. The simulation of the model with different fixed capacitor sizes shows that there is no risk that transformers would fall into resonance along with fixed capacitors under the toed harmonics due to the selected size of capacitors and level of load harmonics. The voltage rise due to fixed type capacitors at no load condition is insignificant for the sizes of capacitors proposed in this study, Hence there is no risk that the power transformers would not fall into ferroresonance due to fixed capacitors. Practical difficulties of usage of LV fixed type capacitors were identified and solutions were recommended so that a cluster of fixed value shunt capacitors can be installed and operated effectively at low voltage distribution level for achieving greater economical benefits...|$|E
