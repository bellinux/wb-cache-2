40|$|The use of <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> is a {{widespread}} clinical practice {{in the treatment of}} various cardiovascular disorders. These <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> are valuable only when they have been developed based on sound rational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic criteria, and when claims for their benefits have been supported by evidence-based data and well-designed clinical studies. However, a look at the available <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> reveals that there are combinations which do not meet these basic criteria, and hence their clinical benefit is debatable. In this context, several stakeholders have put forward their views on the rationality of some of the <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations.</b> The situation has become more complicated as there are very limited reports to assess and describe the rationality of <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> on an individual basis. In the present study, a thorough evaluation of 44 <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> used in various cardiovascular disorders using comprehensive criteria has been completed. This evaluation has demonstrated {{that a large number of}} <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> are rational, based on the criteria used. Finally, there seems to be enough reason to re-investigate six of them, which did not match the criteria as well as others. These six combinations could be the subject of study by the clinicians and/or pharmaceutical companies to assess their clinical benefit...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{guidelines}} recommend {{initiation of}} antihypertensive therapy with <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> in high-risk patients because such patients usually need {{two or more}} blood pressure (BP) -lowering agents in order to normalize their BP.

Unless contraindicated they should be one of the components of <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations,</b> whereas the other component may be either a calcium channel antagonist or a thiazide diuretic. <b>Fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> containing an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel antagonist appear particularly effective in preventing complications of coronary heart disease...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a steady {{increase}} in the use of <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> of drugs for the treatment of a range of diseases, including hypertension, cancer, AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. It is now evident that patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can also benefit from the use of <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations,</b> including combinations of a long-acting β 2 -agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid, and combinations of long-acting β 2 -agonists and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists. In fact, there are now a number of "triple-inhaler" <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> under development, with the first such triple combination having been approved in India. This use of combinations containing drugs with complementary pharmacological actions in the treatment of patients with asthma or COPD has also led to the discovery and development of drugs having two different primary pharmacological actions in the same molecule, which we have called "bifunctional drugs". In this review, we discuss {{the state of the art}} of these new bifunctional drugs as novel treatments for asthma and COPD that can be categorised as bifunctional bronchodilators, bifunctional bronchodilator/anti-inflammatory drugs and bifunctional anti-inflammatory drugs...|$|R

40|$|Combinations {{of two or}} more oral agents with {{different}} mechanisms of action are often used for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. While these combinations have customarily been taken as separate tablets, several <b>fixed-dose</b> single tablet <b>combinations</b> are now available. These are based on bioequivalence with the separate tablets, giving similar efficacy to the separate tablets and necessitating the same cautions and contraindications that apply to each active component. <b>Fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> can offer convenience, reduce the pill burden and simplify administration regimens for the patient. They increase patient adherence compared with equivalent combinations of separate tablets, and this is associated with some improvements in glycaemic control. Presently available antidiabetic <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> include metformin combined with a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidylpeptidase- 4 inhibitor or meglitinide as well as thiazolidinedione-sulphonylurea combinations, each at a range of dosage strengths to facilitate titration.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} doctors' and pharmacists' satisfaction with generic medicines and <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> in cardiology by applying the principles of the tetra-class analysis. The questionnaire was distributed among physicians and pharmacists to evaluate their satisfaction with important medicines' characteristics by classifying them in tetra-class groups. The principles of correspondence analysis were used as statistical methodology. The opinion of both cardiologists and pharmacists coincided in 8 out of the 28 elements of all generic medicines' and fixed-dose combinations' characteristics of satisfaction which were included in the questionnaire. The positive evaluation was more distinctive for doctors, whereas pharmacists were found to be slightly more negatively predisposed, which means that they have a higher risk of being dissatisfied. The tetra-class analysis was found to be suitable for the evaluation of satisfaction with generic medicines and <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> in cardiology. It allowed classification of their characteristics, based on their importance for pharmacists and physicians. The results showed that the opinions of doctors and pharmacists differed. Doctors were more satisfied with generic medicines, whereas the satisfaction with <b>fixed-dose</b> <b>combinations</b> was high in both groups of health care specialists...|$|R

Increasingly, <b>fixed-dose</b> antiretroviral <b>combinations</b> with equal or greater potency than traditional antiretrovirals, along with fewer side effects, reduced toxicity, and simplified dosing convenience are being utilized.

In addition, the drug is active against hepatitis B virus. Caution must be exercised in patients with renal insufficiency, or when the drug is used with certain other drugs.
