Each <b>definition</b> <b>pattern</b> gives {{a set of}} similar words {{and can be used}} as a template to clarify distinctions among them. To discover these definition patterns, we convert definition sentences into tree structures, and compress them using the MDL principle. An experiment on a Japanese children dictionary is reported, showing the effectiveness of our method. ...|$|E

40|$|Surfaces {{in close}} {{proximity}} exchange heat through evanescent photon tunnelling modes {{as well as by}} freely propagating modes. These additional near field contributions to radiation scale with separation, d, be ween surfaces as d- 2 and are dominant at spacings d<<lT, a typical wavelength at temperature T. We calculate simple expressions for the photon tunnelling and find that there are drastic effects in many nanostructured systems, for example in the scanning tunnelling microscope. The results are linked to quantum information theory which dictates that the maximum heat tunnelling current in any one channel is determined by the temperature alone. Consequences for the scanning tunnelling microscope are discussed, where a hot tip may cause intense local heating of a surface without actually being in physical contact, hence desorbing molecular species, or even modifying the surface itself: a possible extension of the STM’s capacity for surface modification. A further extension of this concept is proposed {{in the form of a}} ‘heat stamp ’ capable of delivering a high <b>definition</b> <b>pattern</b> of heat to a second surface. PACS: 07. 79. S...|$|E

Objective(s) : The {{objective of this}} discourse is to review the state of diabetes care in Nigeria with focus on the needs, priorities and recommendations, which should guide our clinicians. It will discuss the <b>definition,</b> <b>pattern,</b> landmark Nigerian studies on diabetes care, matters arising, morbidity/mortality and proposed strategies for improving diabetes care in Nigeria. Methods (Data Sources /extraction) : The data search used in this review covered studies published from 1959 - 2010, obtained from prevalence studies, hospital statistics, registry reports, landmark hospital-based studies, recent international conference proceedings, world health reports, government estimates, United Nations resolutions on diabetes, international diabetes federation (IDF) declarations and clinical practice guidelines. The medline database, the internet (e-medicine, medscape resource etc), journal articles, World Health and international diabetes federation (IDF) monographs were used. Results: The rising {{prevalence of}} diabetes {{as well as its}} associated morbidity / mortality, preventive measures and effective treatments are well recognized. However, in practice this knowledge is under- utilized because only about a third of Nigerians living with diabetes achieve optimum targets (glycaemic control, blood pressure, lipids and weight). Conclusion: Most Nigerians living with diabetes have suboptimal control, are hypertensives and have chronic complications. Improved quality of care and treatment-to-target is recommended to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to improve students’ reading comprehension through recognizing text organizations at SMP Muhammadiyah 8 Yogyakarta. This research applied the principles of action research. It was conducted in two cycles. The subjects {{of the study were}} 30 students of class IXC of SMP Muhammadiyah 8 Yogyakarta. In collecting data, the research employed some techniques, namely observations, interviews and reading tests. The data were in the forms of field notes, students’ tests and interview transcripts. To deal with the problems, the researcher implemented recognizing text organization as the main activity. This strategy has five kinds of patterns organization, i. e. listing, sequence, comparison/ contrast, cause/ effect, problem/ solution and extended definition. This research employed the strategies of recognizing the sequence pattern for procedure texts and recognizing the extended <b>definition</b> <b>pattern</b> for report text because the focus on this research was procedure and report text. In reference to the application of two cycles, the results of the research reveal that the use of recognizing text organization, particularly, the strategy of recognizing the sequence and the extended definition patterns successfully improved the students’ reading comprehension. The students were able to identify the ideas of paragraphs explained in supporting details and topics told in the chronological order in the text so that they understood the texts. In addition, these activities made them became more active because they were accustomed to identifying the patterns before they answered questions. They also enjoyed the teaching and learning process of reading. The improvements were also seen from the students’ mean score from pre-test and post-test 51, 7 and 63, 2...|$|E

40|$|Committed Join (cJoin) is an {{extension}} of Join with high-level primitives for programming dynamic nested negotiations with compensations. In this paper we show that flat cJoin processes (i. e. processes without sub-negotiations) can be encoded in ordinary Join calculus by exploiting a distributed two-phase commit protocol (D 2 PC). In particular, we first define a type system that singles out flat processes and prove subject reduction for it. Then, we show that all flat cJoin processes can be written in an equivalent canonical form, where a few elementary <b>definition</b> <b>patterns</b> are used. Finally, we show that canonical flat processes can be implemented in Join. It is worth noting that negotiation primitives are encoded as fully distributed agreements between all participants, thus avoiding a centralized coordinator. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{success of}} {{languages}} like Agda and Coq demonstrates {{the potential of}} using dependent types for programming. These systems rely on many high level features like datatype <b>definitions,</b> <b>pattern</b> matching and implicit arguments to facilitate {{the use of the}} language. However, these features complicate the metatheoretical study and are a potential source of bugs. To address these issues we introduce ΠΣ, a dependently typed core language. It is small enough for metatheoretical study and the typechecker is small enough to be formally verified. In this language there is only one mechanism for recursion—used for types, functions and infinite objects— and an explicit mechanism to control unfolding, based on lifted types. Furthermore structural equality is used consistently for values and types; this is achieved by a new notion of α-equality for recursive definitions. We show, by translating several high-level constructions, that ΠΣ is suitable as a core language for dependently typed programming. We also provide a formal description of the language and its typing rules. ...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{chronologically}} {{older people}} approaches “the old” {{as a category}} of people sharing common problems and experiences that {{are rooted in the}} functional disparities between old and younger people. These functional disparities are seen as impinging on social and economic positioning, leading to asymmetries in dependence and vulnerability. The argument here is that, rather than simply being an objective functional condition, old age is a deeply contested, socially structured condition precisely because the definition of “old” does not merely denote diverging abilities, but confers differential needs, rights and obligations on both the “old” and on younger people. Drawing on research in rural and urban South India, the article illustrates how definitions of “old age” are shaped by class position within local economies. These <b>definitions</b> <b>pattern</b> older people's access to work and, consequently, not only the extent to which people can remain self-supporting in old age, but also the degree to which younger people expect downward resource flows. ...|$|R
