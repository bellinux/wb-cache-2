40|$|Numerical (2 D) {{simulations}} of persistent contrails have been performed. The simulations {{begin in the}} vortex phase (i. e. when the aircraft wake dynamics are dominated by the pair of <b>downward</b> <b>travelling</b> vortices) and pursue the evolution for half an hour. It will be shown that the lateral expansion of a contrail is mainly horizontal when the air inside it assumes a constant potential temperature during the vortex phase {{as a result of}} thermal isolation from the ambient air. If, however, the air inside the contrail becomes stably stratified as a result of strong thermal contact with a stably stratified environment, the lateral expansion will be more isotropic. The cross section spreading rate ranges from 110 - 240 m" 2 s"-" 1. The expansion is mainly caused by the secondary and higher order vortices that develop in the reaction of the atmosphere on the <b>downward</b> <b>travelling</b> pair of primary vortices which in turn are produced by the aircraft itself. Humidity and temperature of the ambient air control the growth of the ice particles and, therefore, all properties that depend on crystal size and the overall ice production rate. Radiative cooling and release of latent heat are thermodynamically inefficient and do not induce convective motions in the contrail. (orig.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the vortex}} regime the {{contrail}} development {{is governed by}} the wake dynamics. The major fraction of the ice crystals is trapped inside the <b>downward</b> <b>travelling</b> vortex pair. For am-bient supersaturations below a certain threshold, none of the trapped crystals survive the vortex phase. Only crystals detrained during the descent form the contrail. The ambient relative humidity has a strong impact on the vertical extent of the contrail and {{on the number of}} surviving ice crystals, especially in the vortex. Contrail development during the vortex regime was modelled with ambient supersaturations ranging from 0 % to 20 %. The computationally cheap 2 D-code permits a large number of simulations. A realistic vortex decay was ensured using parameterisations of 3 D-simulations. The obtained results give detailed information on initial states for contrail-to-cirrus simulations. ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "resonance tuning", some {{naturally}} aspirated intake systems operate at a volumetric efficiency above 100%: the air pressure in the combustion chamber before the compression stroke {{is greater than the}} atmospheric pressure. In combination with this intake manifold design feature, the exhaust manifold design, as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center.

50|$|Z-axis {{drive and}} control are handled in several ways. The {{first and most}} common is a simple solenoid that pushes against a spring. When the solenoid is {{energized}} it pushes the milling head down against a spring stop that limits the <b>downward</b> <b>travel.</b> The rate of descent {{as well as the}} amount of force exerted on the spring stop must be manually set by mechanically adjusting the position of the solenoid's plunger. The second type of Z-axis control is {{through the use of a}} pneumatic cylinder and a software-driven gate valve. Due to the small cylinder size and the amount of air pressure used to drive it there is little range of control between the up and down stops. Both the solenoid and pneumatic system cannot position the head anywhere other than the endpoints, and are therefore useful for only simple 'up/down' milling tasks. The final type of Z-axis control uses a stepper motor that allows the milling head to be moved in small accurate steps up or down. Further, the speed of these steps can be adjusted to allow tool bits to be eased into the board material rather than hammered into it. The depth (number of steps required) as well as the downward/upward speed is under user control via the controlling software.|$|E
5000|$|Travel is {{the measure}} of {{distance}} {{from the bottom of}} the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle's wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the vehicle). Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. [...] "Bottoming" [...] can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.) Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps called [...] "limiting straps" [...] to limit the suspensions <b>downward</b> <b>travel</b> to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches [...] "full droop", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their [...] "buckets" [...] if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the [...] "bump-stop", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent [...] "bottoming" [...] of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that [...] "bottoms out" [...] will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber [...] "nubs" [...] to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a [...] "last-ditch" [...] emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{estimates}} are presented for {{the motion of}} vortex wakes shed by multiple aircraft flying in close formation. The purpose of the theoretical {{study was to determine}} whether the spacings between adjacent aircraft in close formations could be designed so that the lift-generated vortices being trailed would move upward rather than downward. In this way, a region below the formation is produced that is free of vortices. It was found that aircraft can be arranged in formations so that the inboard wake vortices all move upward rather than downward. The two outboard vortices travel downward at a greatly reduced velocity that depends on the number of aircraft in the formation. If the desired motions are to be produced, the lateral spacings between adjacent aircraft centerlines must be between 1. 1 and 1. 5 wingspans, and the vertical spacings between - 0. 025 and - 0. 15 wingspans. Since the range of acceptable spacings is small, it is recommended that the position accuracy between aircraft in the formation be kept within about + or - 0. 01 wingspan of the center of acceptable spacings so that aircraft meandering do not cause unwanted vortex excursions. It was also found that, if the in-trail spacings between adjacent aircraft are more than 4 wingspans, the foregoing vertical spacings must be adjusted to allow for the additional <b>downward</b> <b>travel</b> of the vortices shed by leading aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{marine data}} is {{acquired}} by towed streamers and air-gun sources deployed at small distances below the sea level. A towed hydrophone records both upward travelling waves {{as well as}} <b>downward</b> <b>travelling</b> waves including the receiver ghost which reflects from the sea-surface and therefore changes its polarity. Every subsurface reflection is disturbed by the ghost. Ghost reflections interfere with the primary reflections and distort the frequency spectrum of the recorded seismic data. Spectral notches are introduced at different frequencies depending upon the towed streamer depth, affecting the bandwidth of the data. To minimize the ghost effect least-squares filtering can be applied. However these methods do not introduce any new information and thus do not fundamentally change the poor {{signal to noise ratio}} at these notch frequencies. So in order to suppress the effect of the receiver ghost additional data is needed. This includes acquisition using two streamers placed at different depths or alternatively using a dual-sensor streamer including particle velocity sensors. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the performance of different deghosting techniques applied to real data acquired using conventional streamer, over/under towed streamer and dual-sensor streamer...|$|R

40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first spark jumps the gap, <b>downward</b> <b>travel</b> of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface.

40|$|Cluster {{multipoint}} {{measurements of}} the electric and magnetic fields from a crossing of auroral field lines {{at an altitude of}} 4 RE are used to show {{that it is possible to}} resolve the ambiguity of temporal versus spatial variations in the fields. We show that the largest electric fields (of the order of 300 mV/m when mapped down to the ionosphere) are of a quasi-static nature, unipolar, associated with upward electron beams, stable on a time scale of at least half a minute, and located in two regions of downward current. We conclude that they are the high-altitude analogues of the intense return current/black auroral electric field structures observed at lower altitudes by Freja and FAST. In between these structures there are temporal fluctuations, which are shown to likely be <b>downward</b> <b>travelling</b> Alfv&# 233;n waves. The periods of these waves are 20 - 40 s, which is not consistent with periods associated with either the Alfv&# 233;nic ionospheric resonator, typical field line resonances or substorm onset related Pi 2 oscillations. The multipoint measurements enable us to estimate a lower limit to the perpendicular wavelength of the Alfv&# 233;n waves to be of the order of 120 km, which suggests that the perpendicular wavelength is similar to the dimension of the region between the two quasi-static structures. This might indicate that the Alfv&# 233;n waves are ducted within a wave guide, where the quasi-static structures are associated with the gradients making up this waveguide...|$|R
