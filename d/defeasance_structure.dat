5000|$|Colorado - In {{a letter}} {{published}} as an appendix to an October 2003 state audit report, Colorado's director of economic development, F. Robert Lee, wrote: [...] "We {{believe that the}} current CAPCO structure is far too expensive. Upon completion of the first phase, this program will cost the General Fund and the taxpayers of this state $100 million. Yet, of that amount, only about $40 million will initially be available for investment in Colorado businesses. The CAPCOs {{have argued that the}} <b>defeasance</b> <b>structure</b> and guaranty insurance are necessary in order to attract investment from insurance companies. We respectfully disagree. These are monies that the participating insurance companies owe the State of Colorado. There is no reason to guarantee their investments. They should not profit at the expense of small businesses; these taxes would have been owed anyway." [...] Three months later in his annual State of the State address, Governor Bill Owens criticized the program and called for its termination: [...] "By any measure the CAPCO program has failed. The state auditor’s recent report on the program is very compelling. Fact: the insurance companies collected nearly $1 million more in fees than they invested in venture capital. Fact: the state auditor could not verify the CAPCO companies’ claims about the alleged number of jobs created. Fact: Nearly half a million in taxpayer money went to lobbying fees. I guess that at least supports 'job retention.' Friends, all of us here are for economic development. But what separates us from the CAPCO advocates is that we want economic development for Colorado. We want new jobs and new companies on the West Slope, not the West Side of Manhattan. We want innovation in the Tech Center, not Rockefeller Center. We can’t mend this program. We must end this program." ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a conference}} {{entitled}} “The New Financial Architecture in the Eurozone” organised by the European University Institute (EUI) and the Brevan Howard Centre, Imperial College London and {{held at the}} EUI in Florence, Italy, on 23 April 2015. The logic, features and future shape of the new financial architecture of the Eurozone were discussed under Chatham House Rules {{on the occasion of}} a high-level conference hosted in Florence on 23 April 2015, by the European University Institute in cooperation with Imperial College London. The conference was attended by central bankers, EU policy- makers, members of the financial industry as well as by academics. The following key conclusions came out from the discussion: 1. Despite its incomplete nature, the Banking Union represents a great achievement in terms of financial stability control, thus ensuring a more resilient euro area. 2. By contrast, the exact objective, scope and institutional capabilities of the Capital Markets Union remain a puzzle to many participants. 3. Risks of regulatory fragmentation arising between the European Union and the Euro Area are somewhat exaggerated, it was overall felt. The existence of European platforms such as the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) acts as a safeguard to the integrity of the single market.

40|$|LL. M. The {{concept of}} a debt {{defeasance}} transaction has recently come under scrutiny in the South African financial market. In the financial arena lower lending rates and efficient tax planning are of paramount consideration to corporate entities seeking to raise finance and to properly structure their affairs. Debt defeasance transactions recognise the time value of money. Companies with long-term borrowings obtain financial advantages if those borrowings can be retired early as {{the present value of}} the liability is less than the face value thereof. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a comparative study of the manner in which debt defeasance transactions have been dealt with in the Australian jurisdiction and how the South African courts would view the income tax consequences of such transactions. The choice of the Australian jurisdiction finds its motivation in the similarity of the income tax regime of that country with the system applied in South Africa. Although the Australian income tax legislation allows for a wider range of income to be recognised as assessable income (hence the frequent references to "income according to ordinary concepts" in the judicial pronouncements in that country) the {{concept of a}}n accrual of income is recognised and applied in the Australian legislation in a similar manner to that of the South African income tax legislation. In addition, there have been a number of recent decisions in the Australian courts on debt defeasance transactions that were implemented during the 1980 's. Given that the South African courts are mindful of developments in 2 Australia and will seek guidance from that jurisdiction, the contemporary nature of the Australian decisions referred to below is insightful and useful in a comparative study. The conclusions reached in this dissertation are that the income tax benefits sought by the parties to the transaction and which are pivotal to the success of the transaction, will not be available in the South African context, just as they are not available in Australia. In certain circumstances the debt defeasance profit, as it is termed in this paper, will be fully taxable in the hands of the taxpayer to whom it accrues, particularly in regard to instantaneous defeasances and where the taxpayer is a financial institution. It is this outcome of the application of the general principles of the South African income tax legislation that leads to the failure of the transaction as a fund raising tool in the structured finance environment. Thought has been given to whether or not the South African legislation should be amended to cater specifically for the debt defeasance transaction. There are no issues that are created by these transactions, such as mismatches in the timing of accruals and deductions as is the case in the trading of financial instruments, that are not already catered for in the current income tax legislation. The main enquiry in determining the consequences of a debt defeasance transaction is in the application of the gross income definition in section 1 of The Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The application of the gross income definition is trite law and the judicial pronouncements thereon are 3 adequate guidance and it is submitted that no amendment to the Income Tax Act is required to cater for debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions. The <b>structure</b> of this paper will be to give an overview of the mechanics of debt defeasance transactions and the defeasance transactions and the consequences thereof. A survey of the Australian examples of debt defeasances is undertaken and the judgements given by the Australian courts in response to such transactions are canvassed. An analysis will finally be undertaken on the income tax consequences of debt defeasances as they have been imported into South Afric...|$|R
