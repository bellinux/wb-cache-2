40|$|Most {{farmers in}} the Ethiopian {{highlands}} are dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The indigenous cereal tef {{is the most important}} crop for the {{farmers in the}} highlands. The central highland is an <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>area</b> and a marginal area of Ethiopia with a recurring problem for the farmers to sustain an adequate agricultural production. The objectives of this thesis are; to analyse the rainfall change and rainfall variability in time and space and its impact on farmers’ potential to cultivate during the short rainy season Belg; to analyse the status of soil parameters and its consequences for farmers’ food production and; to analyse land-use changes and its consequences for the farmers dependent on agriculture. The geographical focus is on the central highlands and especially South Wollo. The rainfall analysis is based on daily rainfall data from 13 stations and covers the time period 1964 - 2012. Land use and land cover changes were analysed by interpretation of black and white aerial photographs from 1958 and colour satellite images from 2003 and 2013. All soil samples used in the study were analysed according to standard methods. In addition interviews with farmers and field observations were done during six different field campaigns between 1999 and 2012. The results reveal a decline in the total Belg rainfall since the 1980 ´s in the central highlands. The total amounts of rainfall during the long rainy season, called Kiremt, have increased during the same time period. An increase in the rainfall variability over time is also found. The increased rainfall variability is also found when comparing two adjacent places only 30 km apart. It is also found that the synchronicity of rainfall between the two adjacent stations is very low during Belg, but higher during Kiremt season. A rainfall model for tef cultivation is developed and used as a tool to analyse the impact of rainfall changes on tef cultivation. The model suggests that during the time period 1963 - 1982 and 1984 - 2003 farmers were able to have a potential tef harvest every second year during both these twenty-year periods. The model also shows that the possibilities to grow tef at Combolcha after 1996 has become more difficult and the possibilities to grow tef during the Belg season are very limited today. A comparison of the soils´ nutrient status and mechanical properties in Tehuledere and Wenchi shows that most parameters are found within a normal range however, the organic matter content is very low in Tehuledere, which may explain lower soil productivity compared to Wenchi. This also confirms the farmers’ perception regarding the soil productivity in Tehuledere. The study also suggests that different cropping strategies such as enset plantation may have a significant positive effect on the soil status. An {{increase in the number of}} houses and a decrease of farm land during the past 50 years suggest that land is more intensively used today. The fact that the farmers claimed that they not have been able to have land in fallow may confirm this. New techniques such as water harvesting ponds introduced in the study area in 2009, as well as the development of irrigation systems along a creek introduced in 1999, are measures that may increase the agricultural production and enable some farmers to develop and improve their farming strategies. The findings presented in this thesis shows that there is a need to improve the soil productivity parameters such as organic matter in many areas. The change in rainfall shows that the impact rainfall has on farmers potential to grow tef varies from one place to another. Some farmers having access to larger land, access to irrigation or water harvesting have improved their livelihood situation, but on the other hand some farmers have ended up in a more difficult situation due to changes of rainfall, sometimes in combination with problems with soil productivity. Future studies of the farmers’ situation such as analysis of land-use changes, analysis of farming strategies and adaptation due to the rainfall changes are important to understand how to reduce poverty in rural Ethiopia in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{investigates the}} economic determinants of land degradation in developing countries. The main trends examined are rural households' decisions to degrade {{as opposed to}} conserve land resources, {{and the expansion of}} frontier agricultural activity that contributes to forest and marginal land conversion. These two phenomena appear often to be linked. In many developing areas, a poor rural household's decision whether to undertake long-term investment in improving existing agricultural land must be weighed against the decision to abandon this land and migrate to <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas.</b> Economic factors {{play a critical role in}} determining these relationships. Poverty, imperfect capital markets and insecure land tenure may reinforce the tendency towards short-term time horizons in production decisions, and may bias land use decisions against long-term land management strategies. In periods of commodity booms and land speculation, wealthier households generally take advantage of their superior political and market power to ensure initial access to better quality resources, in order to capture a larger share of the resource rents. Poorer households are confined either to marginal environmental areas where resource rents are limited, or only have access to resources once they are degraded and rents dissipated. Overall trends in land degradation and deforestation are examined, followed by an overview of rural households' resource management decisions with respect to land management, frontier agricultural expansion, and migration from existing agricultural land to frontiers. Finally, the discussion focuses on the scope for policy improvements to reduce economic constraints to effective land management. <br...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Native Vegetation Protection Law of Brazil, which {{replaced}} the Forest Code from 1965, is still undergoing regulation at {{federal and state}} levels, and the constitutionality of some clauses are still in question. In order to support legal rulings, decisions by public officers, and to inform other stakeholders, we present a balanced assessment of {{the positive and negative}} consequences of Native Vegetation Protection Law in light of current scientific knowledge. Key advances were noted in the systems of controls and incentives, which promoted new mechanisms and policies to support the implementation of this law. The main environmental setbacks were (i) the removal of protection of certain <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas,</b> (ii) the concession of amnesty of fines incurred for violating the preceding legislation, (iii) allowing continuous farming or maintenance of infrastructure in areas protected by law, without full recovery of native vegetation. The weakening of Native Vegetation Protection Law may hamper soil and watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and even agricultural productivity, without manifest benefits for the country. On that account, we recommend that: (i) judiciary rulings and state and county regulations to correct pending issues with the Native Vegetation Protection Law based on scientific knowledge and with wider citizen participation; (ii) the strengthening of agencies for rural technical assistance; (iii) the development of incentives to develop the supply chain for native vegetation recovery; (iv) the regulation of compensation for Legal Reserves based on clear and robust environmental criteria; and (v) the assessment of legal compliance has also {{to be based on the}} environmental quality of recovered areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{has as its}} general theme the solutions-locations found by the poorest part of the {{population}} of Brazilian cities in terms of housing. It specifically addresses the appropriation of environmentally sensitive areas in urban locations for that purpose, (more precisely, the edges of urban water bodies), and the conflicts (social, environmental and, consequently, political) that surround such situations. The research is a case study which has as its empirical focus the situation of the human settlements {{on the banks of the}} Mundaú Lagoon in Maceió, capital of Alagoas, and takes as its starting point the hypothesis that "the urban environmental issue is primarily a housing problem and a problem of the adoption of policies that will facilitate the access of the majority of the population to adequate housing". (Martins 2002, p. 126) The discussion focuses initially on the relationship between the process of urbanization and poverty in Brazil, contextualizing the settlements of the poorest {{part of the population}} of Brazilian cities and specifically of the city of Maceió. This is followed by a discussion of the socio-environmental dimension of human settlements in environmentally sensitive areas, especially those located on the shores of Mundaú Lagoon. Later, we discuss public policies for the promotion of housing for the poorest in Brazilian cities, with emphasis on those policies which are related to the human settlements on the banks of Mundaú Lagoon, and point out the conflicts of interest that permeate the decisions of public authorities, especially those with respect to the use and occupation of <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas</b> in the urban space. The work leads us to understand that the phenomenon of precarious human settlements in <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas</b> is the result of the reproductive processes of the socio-spatial inequalities inherent in the reproduction of urban space in Brazil. In this manner we come to see the urban environmental issue as a problem that stems from the difficulties of access to adequate housing of most of the population. While this access is determined by the income of the population the place of the poor will be a place ever more excluded from the benefits of the city. Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de AlagoasO presente trabalho tem por tema geral as soluções-localizações encontradas pela população mais pobre nas cidades brasileiras para moradia. Aborda-se especificamente a apropriação de áreas ambientalmente frágeis em meios urbanos para aquele fim, mais precisamente, as margens de corpos d água urbanas, bem como os conflitos (sociais, ambientais e, conseqüentemente, políticos) que envolvem tais situações. A pesquisa consiste em um estudo de caso, que tem por objeto empírico a situação dos assentamentos humanos às margens da lagoa Mundaú, em Maceió, capital de Alagoas e parte da hipótese de que a questão ambiental urbana é antes de tudo um problema de moradia e de adoção de políticas que possibilite o acesso da maioria da população a uma moradia adequada. (MARTINS 2002, p. 126) A discussão trata inicialmente da relação entre o processo de urbanização e a pobreza no Brasil, contextualizando os assentamentos da população mais pobres nas cidades brasileiras e especificamente na cidade de Maceió. Em seguida, discute-se a dimensão socioambiental dos assentamentos humanos em áreas ambientalmente frágeis, mas especificamente, daqueles localizados às margens da Lagoa Mundaú. Posteriormente, abordam-se as políticas públicas de promoção de habitação para os mais pobres nas cidades brasileiras, enfatizando-se aquelas referentes aos assentamentos humanos às margens da lagoa Mundaú e aponta-se para os conflitos de interesse que permeiam as decisões do poder público, especialmente, quando se referem ao uso e ocupação de áreas ambientalmente frágeis no espaço urbano. O trabalho leva a compreensão de que o fenômeno dos assentamentos humanos precários em áreas ambientalmente frágeis é fruto dos processos de reprodução das desigualdades sócioespaciais inerente à reprodução do espaço urbano no Brasil. Desse modo, a questão ambiental urbana aparece como um problema decorrente das dificuldades de acesso à moradia adequada da maior parte da população.

40|$|Ecotourism is {{considered}} an effective agent to conserve <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas</b> while bringing economic opportunities to local communities at the same time. In the past decades, empirical studies about ecotourism's conservation effects on wetland ecosystems attracted relatively less academic attention than rainforests and coral reefs. Florida, listed {{as one of the}} states with the greatest share of wetland loss in the U. S. due to rapid growth in agriculture, tourism, and urban development, has a small number of existing wetlands under the protection of the park and reserve system. To generate long-term positive environmental impacts, ecotourism stakeholders' contributions to planning and management activities could be an alternative beyond land use controls for conserving Florida wetlands. The major objective {{of this study is to}} explore the relationship between ecotourism and wetland conservation contributions which lead to long-term environmental sustainability. The study surveyed 97 nature-based tour operators in Florida on their activeness in a set of wetland planning and management behavior, the proportion of tourism revenue from ecotourism, and the perceived tourism benefits regarding economic, socio-cultural, and ecological aspects. Factor analysis was employed to identify indicators for the composite factors, such as the conservation contributions and incentives (i. e., economic benefits, socio-cultural benefits, and ecological benefits). The effects of ecotourism involvement and conservation incentives on tour operators' participation in wetland conservation practices were statistically modeled. The results demonstrated the business characteristics, degrees of the perceived tourism benefits, and frequency of participation in wetland conservation activities of responding tour operators. On average, tour operators were not as active in wetland management and planning approaches leading to the long-term environmental health as theories suggest they should be. Generally, the regression analysis results illustrated the significant association between ecotourism involvement and tour operators' conservation contribution. It is noteworthy that the effects of ecotourism involvement on tour operators' participation in environmental planning and water management processes were relatively important. In addition, the incentive of the perceived socio-cultural benefits was identified as the leading factor by regression analysis. The findings lent to the policy suggestions in expanding the incentives to drive major stakeholders' active engagement in wetland conservation planning and management, which is critical for collaborative and adaptive management...|$|R

40|$|Protected areas (PAs) are {{changing}} rapidly {{in size and}} scope with the influx of development activities intended to benefit people living within and near their borders. In developing countries, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs), which include ecotourism, are expanding into <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> <b>areas</b> where remote local and indigenous people live. However, decades of research cite the inability of ICDPs to reach their full potential, suggesting {{that they do not}} adequately balance human livelihoods with natural resource conservation. Protected area stakeholder relationships in countries undergoing modernisation and democratisation, and local, indigenous perceptions of project development in relation to social and ecological wellbeing are two largely under-explored areas of research in conservation and ecotourism. Developing a better understanding of approaches to PA conservation and development is critical given the increasing evidence of global ecosystem degradation due to anthropogenic activities and, unless changes are made to policies, institutions and practices, the continued, uneven and detrimental impacts on poor people. The purpose of this doctoral research is to explore the impacts of ecotourism on the wellbeing of human societies and nature in remote PAs, and the connections between community-level ecotourism and other development initiatives to broader PA policies and practices. The study pursues three research objectives: (1) to critically examine stakeholder relations in PA conservation; (2) to identify and assess indigenous perceptions of ecotourism and wellbeing in relation to ecotourism development; and (3) to refine and apply an integrative framework of wellbeing to empirically investigate the ways in which ecotourism enhances or constrains social-ecological sustainability in developing areas. This research was conducted through a case study of three local, indigenous PA communities in the Merak-Sakteng region of Bhutan. Data were collected through unstructured interviews (n= 20); community (n= 68) and non-community (n= 50) semi-structured interviews; focus groups (n= 6); literature review and document analysis; participant observations; and debriefing sessions (n= 4). An empirical analysis of stakeholder relations first examined the progress and outcomes of two recent development projects, revealing that indigenous communities face specific socio-cultural challenges that could benefit from operational adjustments and new approaches. The buen vivir (living well) perspective was then used to analyse indigenous perceptions of ecotourism and wellbeing and the influence of socio-cultural factors, which illustrated the significant links between nature and indigenous cosmologies, socio-cultural values and spiritual beliefs that can impact ecotourism development and local PA governance. Lastly, a social-ecological wellbeing framework was developed to assess subjective, socio-relational, material and ecological dimensions of wellbeing in communities. The framework emphasised the importance of social-relational aspects of wellbeing and their connection to declining ecological conditions, the capacity of power relations between stakeholders to bring about wellbeing, and the constant trade-offs between wellbeing dimensions regarding justice and authority at the local level. This thesis refines an integrative framework of wellbeing to assess social-ecological sustainability by uniting theoretical perspectives from development studies (social wellbeing, buen vivir) and social-ecological systems, and empirically demonstrates the insights to be gained from adopting a multi-dimensional approach to wellbeing in ecotourism development projects. It offers a theoretical and methodological application of the buen vivir perspective to understand and analyse wellbeing in tourism scholarship through a biocentric, communal and culturally sensitive worldview. The dissertation makes an empirical contribution to research in terrestrial ecosystems in the context of Bhutan and provides much needed perspectives on wellbeing from a mountain environment. Moreover, the research findings contribute to broader debates around parks and conservation, indicating the need for more progressive social conservation science and practice, and support for participatory and collaborative governance approaches between local and indigenous communities and external PA stakeholders. These contributions, while situated in the context of Bhutan, are relevant for other development projects and terrestrial PAs around the world...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{high carbon}} {{intensive}} urbanization {{is one of}} the important concerns in the environmental and global warming debates in the context of <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> and sensitive <b>areas</b> like the Himalayas. Rapid urbanization and urban growth leads to rapid destruction of green infrastructure, high emission of GHG from transportation, construction, manufacturing and associated sectors. High waste generation and improper management and disposal of the waste further aggravate the problem. The ecological footprints of supplying food and basic services like water along with the destruction and deterioration of other eco system services makes the urban areas vulnerable to hazards and climate impacts both in the short and the long term. The problems get further accentuated because of poor regional and urban planning practices and weak implementation of planning bye laws and development control regulations. All these have significant impact on the local climate, including heat island effects leading to increased variability and intensity of rainfall, temperature and humidity. As a result the urban areas become more vulnerable to hazards, disasters and epidemics and disease. Under such circumstances vulnerability mapping and evolving response and coping mechanism by internalizing them in sustainable habitat planning and development practices becomes important. Taking action to mitigate the problem is important but equally important is to evolve adaptation strategies which are locally conducive. The paper intends to understand these issues with respect to Gangtok Urban region using the available census and other statistical information. Attempt has been made to understand the weather, climate variability over the last few decades in the region and document the history of hazards and disasters through secondary literature. The study also focuses on the impacts of rapid urban growth on the local environment and its impact on eco system services. To what extent planning and urban management practices have tried to address these concerns have been explored by reviewing existing plan documents, bye laws and their implementation mechanism. Based on these analyses the study highlights vulnerabilities in Gangtok urban region and suggest coping mechanisms and strategies at the local and state level to address urban vulnerabilities in Sikkim...|$|R

25|$|In 2003, California {{suffered}} from an extended drought, {{and there was}} considerable discussion and debate about how much water each water district was entitled to receive from the Colorado River and its tributaries. As a result, several organizations negotiated an agreement for water rights for their associated districts: the San Diego County Water Authority, the Coachella Valley Water District, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The agreement was a compromise that divided available water resources between the <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> Imperial Valley and the more heavily populated areas of Southern California.|$|R

This part of the territory, {{at the edge of}} Padana Megalopolis, has been subjected of many research and didactical experiences focused on the importance of working for <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> regions. The book compiles some lessons focused on the care of landscape, the economic profitability of rural and suburban territories connected to high quality productive system, and relationship between design approach and planning approach to improve governance techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{discharge}} of submarine groundwater {{has recently been}} shown to be an important process in many <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile</b> coastal ecosystems. However, groundwater discharge into coastal bottom water is still an often-overlooked component of many hydrologic and oceanic models. The exchange of interstitial water across the sediment/water interface may introduce anthropogenic pollutants, may be an important part of coastal nutrient cycles, and may cause excess nutrient loading, thereby potentially degrading the coastal water quality. Here we report on Year- 1 results from a co-operative (USGS-UF-LSU) project that is investigating the role of submarine groundwater discharge into Indian River Lagoon, Florida...|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of the province's population is Han Chinese, who are found scattered throughout the region {{with the exception of}} the far western areas. Thus, significant minorities of Tibetan, Yi, Qiang and Nakhi people reside in the western portion that are impacted by inclement weather and natural disasters, <b>environmentally</b> <b>fragile,</b> and impoverished. Sichuan's capital of Chengdu is home to a large community of Tibetans, with 30,000 permanent Tibetan residents and up to 200,000 Tibetan floating population. The Eastern Lipo, included with either the Yi or the Lisu people, as well as the A-Hmao, also are among the ethnic groups of the provinces.|$|R
