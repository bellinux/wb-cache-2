5|$|Emanuel Lasker (December 24, 1868 – January 11, 1941) was a German chess player, mathematician, and philosopher who was World Chess Champion for 27 years (from 1894 to 1921). <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Lasker {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{dominant}} champions, and he is still generally regarded as one of the strongest players ever.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Baxter {{was known}} for his ability to raise a team's morale, his good {{tactical}} vision, precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way – and for being a joker on the pitch. He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major Glasgow rivals, Celtic.|$|E

He not only excelled in soccer, but also {{baseball}} and basketball, and attended Lord Kitchener Elementary and Lord Byng Secondary schools. Haber enjoys listening to, and producing, hip hop music in his spare time. The footballer he most enjoyed watching <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime</b> was Thierry Henry.|$|E

5|$|Hornsby {{was also}} renowned for his speed, and was {{considered}} to be the fastest player in the National League <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime.</b> He did not try to steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30inside-the-park home runs, and he led the league with 17triples in 1917 and 18triples in 1921; he had 20triples in 1920.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Iginla was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} NHL's most prominent power forwards. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like Brendan Shanahan and Keith Tkachuk, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only Jaromír Jágr scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.|$|E
5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to bother him in 1952. While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff that he was no longer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime.</b> Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E

5|$|Swift {{broke into}} the Manchester City first team in 1933, {{taking part in the}} club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2–1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> though during wartime he was chosen to {{represent}} his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{prominent}} athletes hailing {{from the state}} are P. T. Usha, Shiny Wilson and M.D. Valsamma, all three of whom are recipients of the Padma Shri as well as Arjuna Award, while K. M.

Rosakutty and Padmini Selvan are the other Arjuna Award winners from Kerala. Volleyball is another popular sport and is often played on makeshift courts on sandy beaches along the coast. Jimmy George was a notable Indian volleyball player, rated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime</b> as among the world's ten best players. Other popular sports include badminton, basketball and kabaddi. The Indian Hockey team captain P. R. Shreejesh, ace goalkeeper hails from Kerala.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} days of settlement, the Lower Clarence {{district}} lacked roads; virtually all communication within the area and {{with the outside world}} depended upon water transport. Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen, and several of them became national and even world champion scullers. Rush, who <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime</b> was over six feet tall and weighed 13 stone, soon distinguished himself as a powerful 'puller'. He rowed the heavy settlers’ boats, also known as 'butcher boats' delivering meat to Clarence River customers. By 1866, Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of Ulmarra, Lawrence, Brushgrove and Rocky Mouth.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states: [...] "Two vocals and a poem recitation weigh down the music a bit, {{although}} Shepp gets in some good licks. The overall {{results are not}} essential, but Archie Shepp was still <b>in</b> <b>his</b> musical <b>prime</b> at the time." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1989, Scamper {{sustained}} a cut to his coronet band {{at the beginning}} of the NFR. James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She wanted that win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he was still <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime.</b> That year, the pair won both the NFR and WPRA world championships, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his form}} in 193839, Tallon eagerly awaited {{the arrival of}} England for the 194041 tour of Australia. He was only 23 and {{regarded}} as an almost certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and gloves. However, {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War called a halt to his rise and robbed him of the opportunity to represent his country while <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime</b> as a cricketer; official international cricket did not resume until he was 29. In the meantime, domestic cricket continued in 193940. It was another poor season for Queensland, who won only once and lost their remaining five matches. Tallon scored two fifties before scoring 154 in his last Sheffield Shield innings of the season. This set Victoria a target of 230, but they reached it for the loss of only one wicket. Tallon was selected for The Rest of Australia in a one-off match against New South Wales {{at the end of the}} season, but managed only a duck and eight. He ended the summer with 401 runs at 28.62 and 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|Henderson had 468 more {{stolen bases}} {{in his career}} than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most {{prolific}} basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he {{led the league in}} steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.) On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.|$|E

50|$|The {{parliamentary}} process developed {{greatly in}} Greece {{during the reign}} of George I. Initially, the royal prerogative <b>in</b> choosing <b>his</b> <b>prime</b> minister remained and contributed to governmental instability, until the introduction of the dedilomeni principle of parliamentary confidence in 1875 by the reformist Charilaos Trikoupis. Clientelism and frequent electoral upheavals however remained the norm in Greek politics, and frustrated the country's development.|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} career, Grace {{generally}} fielded at long-leg or cover-point; {{later he was}} usually at point (see Fielding positions in cricket). <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> he was a fine thrower, a fast runner and a safe catcher.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> Pauleta was {{considered}} one of the best strikers in Europe. He usually operated as a lone striker or alongside another forward, and combined mobility, pace and athleticism with good technique, two-footedness and strength in the air.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Lee, foreign players mostly played in Japan when their careers were winding down. Lee {{revolutionized}} the Japanese view of foreign players by playing <b>in</b> Japan during <b>his</b> <b>prime,</b> raising the standard for all foreign players thereafter.|$|R

25|$|The {{reforms of}} the Venizelos {{government}} were numerous, and allowed Greece to modernise and thus be better prepared for the Balkan Wars and World War I.
