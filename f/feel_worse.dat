25|$|In 2016, psychologists {{confirmed}} {{the relationship between}} social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged {{the effect of the}} “social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image”; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty. Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to <b>feel</b> <b>worse</b> about their bodies, while another study by the University of South Australia, discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} elderspeak is that {{licensed}} practical nurses, registered nurses, and other healthcare team professionals very seldom have training and expertise {{when it comes}} to communication with elders, and that elderspeak is often used incorrectly. Shorter sentences appear to have a beneficial effect on older adults’ communication, factors of elderspeak such as slow speech and exaggerated pitch tend to make older persons <b>feel</b> <b>worse</b> about their own competency, as well as the competency of the speaker; However, younger adults continue to use elderspeak with these characteristics. Not only does elderspeak fail to improve communication effectiveness for older adults, the messages inherent in elderspeak may unknowingly reinforce dependency and engender isolation and depression, contributing to the spiral of decline in physical, cognitive, and functional status common for elderly individuals.|$|E

40|$|When {{a person}} {{experiences}} interpersonal rejection, {{there are two}} ways this rebuff can take place. The rejector might choose somebody else (comparative rejection) or nobody else (noncomparative rejection) instead of the rejectee. In seven studies, we examined which type of rejection <b>feels</b> <b>worse</b> and why this is. A total of 1, 095 participants recalled, evaluated, or experienced comparative rejection, noncomparative rejection, or both. While the context of the rejections varied from casual, to professional, to romantic, we found the same result every time. It <b>feels</b> <b>worse</b> to be rejected for somebody rather than nobody. And feelings of jealousy-not different attributions-are key to explaining why this is. 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

25|$|A {{study of}} {{elections}} {{has shown that}} the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at NCAA football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an upset, that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as baseball and basketball. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters <b>feel</b> <b>worse,</b> sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the 2012 United States presidential election.|$|E
500|$|Irreversible pulpitis {{progresses}} to pulp necrosis, {{wherein the}} nerves are non-functional, and a pain-free period following the severe pain of irreversible pulpitis may be experienced. However, {{it is common}} for irreversible pulpitis to progress to apical periodontitis, including an acute apical abscess, without treatment. As irreversible pulpitis generates an apical abscess, the character of the toothache may simply change without any pain-free period. [...] For instance, the pain becomes well localized, and biting on the tooth becomes painful. Hot drinks can make the tooth <b>feel</b> <b>worse</b> because they expand the gases and likewise, cold can make it feel better, thus some will sip cold water.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to <b>feel</b> <b>worse</b> than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{symptom of}} pleurisy is a sudden sharp, stabbing, burning or dull {{pain in the}} right or {{left side of the}} chest during breathing, especially when one inhales and exhales. It <b>feels</b> <b>worse</b> with deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, or laughing. The pain may stay in one place, or it may spread to the shoulder or back.

With a c 2 chosen sufficiently small, Helbing’s observed increase of crowd pressure, could lift M to values that could never be reached by density alone.|$|R
2500|$|Those who are shy are {{perceived}} more negatively, in cultures that value sociability, {{because of the}} way they act towards others. [...] Shy individuals are often distant during conversations, which can result in others forming poor impressions of them. People who are not shy may be up-front, aggressive, or critical towards shy people in an attempt [...] "to get them out of their shell." [...] This can actually make a shy person <b>feel</b> <b>worse,</b> as it draws attention to them, making them more self-conscious and uncomfortable.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Easterbrook's books, {{focusing}} on social science, is The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People <b>Feel</b> <b>Worse</b> (2003), which explores people's {{perception of their}} own well-being. The book cites statistical data indicating that Americans are better off in terms of material goods and amount of free time but are not happier than before. Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety (too many decisions to make) and abundance denial (not realizing how well we are doing). [...] His proposed remedy is to make our lives more meaningful by doing good while living well.|$|E

In 2009, Graham went 23-of-28 {{in the regular}} season, his lowest percentage — 82.1 — in his Bengals career. In the Wild Card playoffs on January 9, 2010, Graham missed two field goals in the Bengals' 24-14 loss to the New York Jets, including a 28-yard attempt that would have cut the score to 24-17 late in the fourth quarter. After the game, Marvin Lewis commented on Graham's missed field goals stating [...] "It is a shame, and it killed us. Unfortunately kicking is mostly a one-man operation.

She <b>feels</b> <b>worse</b> when Scott admits that he is interested in Amy, and that he only likes Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts {{to raise money for}} the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to Elizabeth pursuing Scott and ignoring school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeth's embezzlement scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless.|$|R

Schott sent flowers to the umpire dressing room, but a story in the Dayton Daily News later said that the flowers had been given to Schott on Opening Day by Reds television affiliate WLWT in Cincinnati. According to the story, Schott hastily wrote a sympathy note and attached it to the flowers.|$|R
60|$|It is {{as though}} the Rains were just over, {{and none of the}} womenfolk had been allowed to go to the hills. Yet no one talks about the unhealthiness of Singapur.
