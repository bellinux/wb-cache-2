5|$|Many of {{the museums}} have been {{accredited}} by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which sets {{national standards for}} museums in the UK. Several are art galleries providing space <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> of art, or are philatelic, regimental, science, aviation, transport, railway, toy, religious or sports museums, but the majority are local museums. There are also several historic house museums owned or managed by the National Trust or English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci, Georgije I, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci {{commissioned}} the young realist Paja Jovanović to paint Migration of the Serbs, intending {{for it to be}} displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist Uroš Predić, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exhibition,</b> the other being the Vršac triptych, which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.|$|E

5|$|The finds were {{purchased}} by the museum in April 2009 and underwent conservation by specialists at Durham University and York Archaeological Trust. Using tools of the Anglo-Saxon period, {{a replica of the}} bed was created <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> by Richard Darrah, an expert in early woodwork, and blacksmith Hector Cole, a crafter of medieval-style ironwork. A short film about the princess was made at the Anglo-Saxon museum at Bede's World in Jarrow with a narration by Stephen Tompkinson. Prior to the opening of the exhibition at Kirkleatham, the finds were put on display for five days in May 2011 at Loftus Town Hall, where they attracted nearly 1,700 visitors.|$|E
5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exhibition</b> of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1852, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} life-sized concrete model of Megalosaurus <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked {{under the direction of}} Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that Megalosaurus would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s. Today, they are seen as a separate genus Becklespinax, but Owen referred them to Megalosaurus. The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time, at least in England, that ancient reptiles had existed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition</b> was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter {{as well as a}} gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) high price of $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
50|$|From 1889, he was {{a member}} of the Academy and its {{teaching}} staff and in 1898, he became a professor. Björck was Commissar <b>for</b> Art at <b>the</b> Stockholm <b>Exhibition</b> in 1897, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Baltic <b>Exhibition</b> in 1914 and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>exhibition</b> in London in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 Festa on Ice was {{different}} from other ice shows. FOI installed a large screen and showed video arts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions</b> of skaters. Performers of the show presented unique programs such as a battle between B-boys and skaters.|$|R
5000|$|A museum club in Chrudim {{was set up}} in 1865. In 1892 a {{professional}} institution was established under the name [...] "Průmyslové muzeum pro východní Čechy v Chrudimi" [...] (Industrial museum for Eastern Bohemia in Chrudim). The museum's first building was constructed during 1897-1898, the second during 1898-1901. The first, built in Neo-Renaissance style, served <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> <b>the</b> second, built in Neo-Baroque style, housed cultural actions and accessions.|$|R
5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>exhibition,</b> made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
