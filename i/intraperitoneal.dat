5|$|Elemental {{scandium}} {{is considered}} non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds {{has not been}} done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4mg/kg for <b>intraperitoneal</b> and 755mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the <b>intraperitoneal</b> LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts of}} the colon are either <b>intraperitoneal</b> or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general {{do not have a}} {{complete}} covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. <b>Intraperitoneal</b> organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are <b>intraperitoneal.</b> This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intraperitoneal</b> {{chemotherapy}} {{has also}} been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as <b>intraperitoneal</b> chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: irinotecan combined with cisplatin.|$|E

25|$|Intravascular transfusion—blood transfused into fetal {{umbilical}} vein—This is {{the method}} of choice since the late 1980s, and more effective than <b>intraperitoneal</b> transfusion. A sample of fetal blood can be taken from the umbilical vein prior to the transfusion.|$|E
25|$|A common regimen {{for general}} {{anesthesia}} {{for the house}} mouse is ketamine (in the dose of 100mg per kg body weight) plus xylazine (in the dose of 5–10mg per kg), injected by the <b>intraperitoneal</b> route. It has a duration of effect of about 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of honokiol {{have been}} explored in rats and mice; however, further research {{must be done}} in humans. Intravenous delivery of 5–10mg/kg in rodent models has shown a plasma half-life of around 40–60 minutes while <b>intraperitoneal</b> injections of 250mg/kg had a plasma half-life around 4–6 hours with maximum plasma concentration occurring between 20–30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the most}} likely human route of uptake of CYN is ingestion, oral {{toxicity}} experiments were conducted on mice. The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} 4.4-6.9mg CYN/kg, and in addition to some ulceration of the oesophageal gastric mucosa, symptoms were consistent with that of <b>intraperitoneal</b> dosing. Stomach contents included culture material, which indicated that these LD50 figures might be overestimated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intraperitoneal</b> {{parts of}} the GI tract are covered with serosa. These include most of the stomach, {{first part of the}} duodenum, all of the small intestine, caecum and appendix, {{transverse}} colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. In these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue. These {{parts of the}} tract have a mesentery.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though <b>intraperitoneal</b> chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. <b>Intraperitoneal</b> chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine {{indirectly}} affects opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) {{as well as}} the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and {{was shown}} to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection. These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.|$|E
25|$|Pathological changes {{associated}} with CYN poisoning {{were reported to}} be in four distinct stages: inhibition of protein synthesis, proliferation of membranes, lipid accumulation within cells, and finally cell death. Examination of mice livers removed at autopsy showed that on <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection of CYN, after 16 hours ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) had detached, and at 24 hours, marked proliferation of the membrane systems of the smooth ER and Golgi apparatus had occurred. At 48 hours, small lipid droplets had accumulated in the cell bodies, and at 100 hours, hepatocytes in the hepatic lobules were destroyed beyond function.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationalization}} of mesenteric and peritoneal fold anatomy {{permits the}} surgeon to differentiate both from <b>intraperitoneal</b> adhesions—also called congenital adhesions. These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral {{aspect of the}} peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.|$|E
25|$|The A. Vassiliadis Pavilion for Advanced Surgery has 14 {{operating}} rooms of 650 sq ft each. It occupies {{the second and}} third floors of the medical center and is named for Carol Vassiliadis' $8.5 million gift on behalf of her deceased husband Alkiviadis. The pavilion is staffed by 200 surgeons and provides technology to perform surgeries not possible elsewhere in the county. These include minimally invasive surgeries to treat cancer and obesity; microsurgeries to restore voice, hearing, and facial function; MRI-guided gene therapy for brain cancer; heated <b>intraperitoneal</b> chemotherapy for abdominal cancer; spine and joint reconstruction; and robotic surgery for several cancers. The technologies at work include the region's only four intraoperative MRI machines, which allow real-time imaging of tumors and gene therapies during surgery to ensure complete treatment, as well as the nation's only Restriction Spectrum Imaging technology, which color code brain fibers to better plan for complex surgeries in advance. The area also includes three Intensive Care Units with 36 private rooms.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin meglumine may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. <b>Intraperitoneal</b> unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E
500|$|There are {{no clear}} {{indications}} that europium is particularly toxic {{compared to other}} heavy metals. Europium chloride, nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity: europium chloride shows an acute <b>intraperitoneal</b> LD50 toxicity of 550mg/kg and the acute oral [...] LD50 toxicity is 5000mg/kg. Europium nitrate shows a slightly higher <b>intraperitoneal</b> LD50 toxicity of 320mg/kg, while the oral toxicity is above 5000mg/kg. The metal dust presents a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} cicutoxin by <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection is 48.3mg per kg {{body weight}} (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection, while the LD50 for arsenic via <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The venom of this cobra is a postsynaptic neurotoxin and bites {{result in}} severe neurotoxicity. Ernst and Zug et al. 1996 list {{a value of}} 0.225mg/kg SC. According to Brown and Fry of the Australian Venom and Toxin Database, the murine <b>intraperitoneal</b> [...] value is 0.324mg/kg. The average venom yield per bite is 571mg and the maximum venom yield is 1102mg. This snake can be highly {{dangerous}} due to the quantity of venom it can inject in a single bite and its aggressive nature when defending. Death can occur rapidly, within 30 to 120 minutes in severe cases of envenomation. Signs and symptoms of envenomation include , drowsiness, limb paralysis, hearing loss, inability to speak, dizziness, ataxia, shock, hypotension, abdominal pain, fever, pallor, and other neurological and respiratory symptoms.|$|E
500|$|The {{occupancy}} of dopamine transporter (DAT) sites by bupropion and its metabolites in {{the human}} brain as measured by positron emission tomography was 26% according to GlaxoSmithKline researchers and 14% in an independent study. However, despite this reported weak DAT occupancy, a subsequent study looked at the actual extracellular concentrations of dopamine {{in the human}} brain after an acute oral treatment of bupropion and failed to observe any increase, concluding that the weak DAT occupancy was not sufficient to increase dopamine levels. In contrast, the same study also looked at dopamine levels in the rat brain after administration of bupropion via <b>intraperitoneal</b> injection and did see an increase, {{which could have been}} related to species differences. An alternative explanation is that the difference {{had to do with the}} different routes of administration employed (i.e., oral vs. i.p.) and the associated differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism, namely, the bypassing of first-past metabolism with the latter route, that resulted. Although oral bupropion at clinical doses does not appear to have a significant potential for abuse, there are many isolated case reports of bupropion abuse and [...] "cocaine-like" [...] effects in humans who ingested the drug via a non-oral route (e.g., injection, insufflation, etc.). Notably, awareness of the abuse potential of bupropion via non-conventional routes appears to be especially prominent in correctional facilities.|$|E
