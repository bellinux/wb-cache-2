50|$|A {{physical}} <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course {{made from}} plastic {{can be installed}} into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{assessing}} damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, {{the next step is}} to look for the presence of a damp-proof course. If a damp-proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> courses fail for one reason or another.|$|E
50|$|<b>Damp</b> <b>proofing</b> {{is defined}} by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as a {{material}} that resists the passage of water with no hydro-static pressure and waterproof as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure. Generally <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> keeps moisture out of a building where vapor barriers keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute: it is usually defined by a specific test method, limits, and engineering tolerances.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 {{fundraising}} {{was undertaken}} to provide toilets {{and a new}} kitchen in the church. Improvements were also made to the <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> and insulation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Damp</b> <b>proofing</b> in {{construction}} {{is a type}} of moisture control applied to building walls and floors to prevent moisture from passing into the interior spaces. Damp problems are among the most frequent problems encountered in homes.|$|R
50|$|Sandstone for {{the church}} was {{obtained}} from the nearby Yangan quarry and the granite, used in the piers both internally and externally, from Greymare. A <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course, of sheet lead in asphalt was inserted to all the walls.|$|E
50|$|Water {{resistant}} and waterproof often {{refer to}} penetration {{of water in}} its liquid state and possibly under pressure, whereas <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> refers to resistance to humidity or dampness. Permeation of water vapor through a material or structure is reported as a moisture vapor transmission rate.|$|E
50|$|Many {{houses were}} {{incrementally}} improved. In the 1920s most were wired for electricity, {{and in the}} 1930s the deeper Belfast sink and drainer replaced the shallower cane glazed London sink. The improved <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course arrested water ingress, and with the suspended floors halted wood rot.|$|E
5000|$|Tyvek: Dupont Company {{produces}} non-woven polyethylene {{which can}} be converted into bag. This cloth {{is used as a}} <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> membrane, envelopes and protective clothing amongst other things. These types of bags are strong but not as breathable as others.|$|R
50|$|Butyl rubber sealant is {{used for}} <b>damp</b> <b>proofing,</b> rubber roof repair and for {{maintenance}} of roof membranes (especially around the edges). It {{is important to have}} the roof membrane fixed, as a lot of fixtures (e.g., air conditioner vents, plumbing, and other pipes) can considerably loosen it.|$|R
2500|$|Given {{the humid}} {{environment}} directly over running water, mold had {{proven to be}} a problem. The elder Kaufmann called Fallingwater [...] "a seven-bucket building" [...] for its leaks, and nicknamed it [...] "Rising Mildew". Condensation under roofing membranes was also a problem, {{due to the lack of}} <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> or thermal breaks.|$|R
50|$|The groundworkers {{are usually}} {{the first and last}} trades {{performed}} on site. They will start the job putting in levels, digging the ground, excavating and concreting the foundations, and building the foundations until the floor is on and the work is up to the <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course (dpc). They are also the team responsible for the drainage; connecting to the existing pipes installing in the new pipes.|$|E
50|$|Concrete {{normally}} allows moisture to {{pass through}} so a vertical <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> barrier is needed. Barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to {{the exterior of the}} concrete. The coating may be asphalt, asphalt emulsion, a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt, or a rubber polymer. Membranes are rubberized asphalt or epdm rubber. Rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete.|$|E
5000|$|A {{damp-proof}} course (DPC) is a barrier through the structure {{designed to prevent}} moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp. Rising damp {{is the effect of}} water rising from the ground into property. The <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course may be horizontal or vertical. A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall.|$|E
50|$|A {{vapor barrier}} (or vapour barrier) is any {{material}} used for <b>damp</b> <b>proofing,</b> typically a plastic or foil sheet, that resists diffusion of moisture through wall, ceiling and floor assemblies of buildings to prevent interstitial condensation and of packaging. Technically, {{many of these}} materials are only vapor retarders as they have varying degrees of permeability.|$|R
50|$|Dry rot (Serpula lacrymans) is {{considered}} difficult to remove, requiring drastic action. Remedial timber treatment and <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> companies typically recommend stripping out of building fabric beyond the visible {{extent of the}} infestation {{and the use of}} fungicide. More holistic approaches attempt to eradicate dry rot by controlling the local environment to reduce timber moisture levels and increase ventilation in order to promote drying.|$|R
50|$|Common {{measures}} {{of the effectiveness of}} a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate (comfort), indoor air quality (hygiene and public health), durability and energy efficiency. In order to achieve these objectives, all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure, a drainage plane, an air barrier, a thermal barrier, and may include a vapor barrier. Moisture control (e.g. <b>damp</b> <b>proofing)</b> is essential in all climates, but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding.|$|R
5000|$|Liquid-injection {{products}} {{were introduced in}} the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products {{is dependent on the}} type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times: ...|$|E
50|$|Damp proofing: This is {{waterproofing}} used {{where the}} water table {{is lower than the}} structure and there is good free-draining fill. The membrane deals with shedding of water and the ingress of water vapor only, with no hydrostatic pressure. Generally, this incorporates a <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> membrane (DPM) to the walls with a polythene DPM under slab. With higher grade DPM, some protection from short-term Hydrostatic pressure can be gained by transitioning the higher quality wall DPM to the slab polythene under footing, rather than at the footing face.|$|E
50|$|In 1875, the Public Health Act was introduced. It {{required}} urban {{authorities to}} make byelaws for new streets, to ensure structural stability of houses and prevent fires, {{and to provide}} for the drainage of buildings and the provision of air space around buildings. Section 57 determined that all houses must be through houses - no more back-to-back housing. Three years later the Building Act of 1878 provided more detail with constructions, defining foundations, <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> courses, thickness of walls, ceiling heights, space between dwellings, under floor ventilation, ventilation of rooms, size of windows. The Local Government Board, established in 1871, issued the first Model Bye-laws in 1877/78. Urban authorities either adopted them, or wrote their own versions adapted to local conditions. While local versions were frequently not so rigorous, they could be generous by modern standards as regards ceiling heights. The importance of the Act was that it defined building standards for the housing of the working class.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2014 the British Board of Agrément {{confirmed}} {{that it would}} consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates {{with a view to}} updating the MOAT No.39 test {{in light of the fact}} that it was not originally designed to test <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment. This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways: ...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{forms of}} {{dampness}} {{can be prevented}} by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include <b>damp</b> <b>proofing</b> {{in the form of}} a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15 cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or [...] "engineering bricks" [...] with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem.|$|R
50|$|Walls are not {{subjected}} to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps {{are designed to}} be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor barriers or air barriers. <b>Damp</b> <b>proofing</b> is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.|$|R

By 1930 when the first slum clearance measures were introduced there was a marked contrast between the residual stock of pre-regulation houses and the newer byelaw houses. The lack of the provisions above had caused the pre-regulation house to physically deteriorate, such that it commanded a far lower rent. It provided accommodation for the very poorest workers; because these houses tended to be closer to the sources of employment, it eliminated the cost of transport.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a Vertical <b>Damp</b> <b>Proof</b> Barrier is to prevent the ingress of damp and water into {{subterranean}} structures such as basements, cellars, tunnels and earth shielded buildings. (Also known as Earth sheltered buildings).Traditionally, this {{took the form of}} several coats of bitumous paint or tar. This, though cheap, has the disadvantage that any movement in the structure or joints is likely to rupture the paint so allowing water to enter. Modern solutions {{take the form of a}} plastic membrane, often pre-coated with adhesive and a [...] "peel off" [...] paper that is applied to the outside of the structure before it is buried. Usually, a [...] "priming coat" [...] of bitumous paint has to be applied first. It often comes in one metre wide rolls and is installed with a 100 mm overlap. The membrane has a high modulous of elasticity (that is, it stretches a lot, often by a factor of ten before it ruptures) Precautions have to be taken that sharp objects in the backfill do not pierce it. Sometimes fine sand is used to backfill but more often insulation boards are laid against it before backfilling, particularly in an inhabited room.As a further precaution against water ingress, it is recommended that land drains be installed behind the protected wall at its base to prevent the buildup of hydrostatic pressure in wet weather.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} excavations at Bangarh {{was carried}} out by a team led by K.G. Goswami during 1938-41. Located {{on the bank of the}} Punarbhaba, the excavated site reflects its urban character. The site has its core in the form of a citadel surrounded by mud ramparts (area about 25 hectares) which dates from the earliest phase of the site.The earliest phase remains uncertain, as the excavations could not reach the natural soil. The citadel area revealed five cultural phases dating from the time of the Mauryas to the medieval period. The initial phase (the Mauryan period) indicates that the city had a modest beginning in which it had probably a mud rampart wall. It was only in the following phase (the Kushana period, 200 BCE - 300 CE) a brick built wide rampart wall is found with drains, cesspits and residential buildings made of burnt bricks of a very large size, showing distinct signs of prosperity and burgeoning urbanism. The excavated materials of the Gupta period are not comparable with the richness and diversity of those belonging to Kushana cultural phase. Though the late Gupta phase of Bangarh is marked by decadence, particularly in terms of building activities, the Pala period (mid 8th century -12th century), in sharp contrast, indicates a picture of efflorescence. Rampart walls, compound walls, residential quarters, temples with ambulatory path and its enclosing walls, <b>damp</b> <b>proof</b> granaries, bathrooms, drains and ring wells suggest a prosperous condition of the city.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in antiquities—in particular scholarly {{observation of the}} architectural details of historic buildings—became reinforced by his membership of the forerunner of the Royal Historical Society, the Camden Society. Indeed, historical accuracy came to characterise Hosking's approach to architecture, as he sought to mix historical elements in appropriate ways. This eye for historical detail was combined with a concern for equally detailed practical improvements in construction techniques (such as fire retardation, <b>damp</b> <b>proofing,</b> {{and other aspects of}} what has become known today as a branch of civil engineering known as building control).|$|R
