Several epidemiological studies strongly suggest that AFB is also a causative agent of liver cancer in humans. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} efficacy of cancer chemoprevention in human and non-human primates. To this end, we examined the effects of chemopreventive agents on AFB metabolism in non-human primates. Hepatic aflatoxin B 1 metabolism profiles of macaque (Macaca nemestrina) and marmo-set (Callithrix jacchus) monkeys were determined and compared to humans. Quantitatively, the oxidative metabolism of this my-cotoxin was similar in the three primate species. In contrast to macaques, both humans and marmosets lacked AFB-glutathione conjugating activity. It was concluded that marmosets resembled human AFB metabolism more closely than the macaques, and therefore, marmoset monkeys were chosen for this study. Eleven adult male marmosets were randomly assigned to three groups. Animals received the synthetic dithiolthione oltipraz, the antiox-idant <b>ethoxyquin,</b> or vehicle only. In addition, two single doses of AFB were also administered orally before and after animals were treated with aforementioned compounds.

Currently, the early-weaning is a strategy performed consisting in the weaning time anticipation to 2 - 3 weeks of age. In addition with the high mortality and morbidity rates the swine production is hampered resulting in economic losses. The effect of the birth weight (BW), weaning strategy (WS) and the small intestine area (SIA) were studied in newborn piglets on the pre-weaning phase by the expression of zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1). 72 pairs of Hypor sex-matched littermates catalogued as low birth weight (LBW< 1 kg, n= 36) or normal birth weight (NWB, n= 36) were randomly distributed to the rearing systems from 3 days to 3 weeks of age. The early-weaned (EW) piglets were artificially fed in brooders with a milk-replacer provided ad libitum. On conventional weaning (CW), piglets stayed with sow and intake colostrum. Pairs of LBW-NBW were slaughtered at 3, 5, 8 and 19 days old. Tissue samples from duodenum (5 %) and ileum (75 %) were harvested to quantify the ZO- 1 expression. Any significant differences related to BW and WS were found although colostrum exerted a greater effect the ileum and in LBW piglets.

We also evaluated the effects of these treatments on the mRNA expression of transcription factors and transporters. On the whole, the intensities of the effects were lower in the OM than in the liver. Dexamethasone was found to be the most efficient treatment in the OM. Dexamethasone induced the transcription of several olfactory phase I, II, and III genes [such as cytochromes P 450 2 A 3 and 3 A 9, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2 A 1, and multidrug resistance-related protein type 1] and increased UGT activities.

40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 Throughout {{the last}} decades the huge demand on fish supply has led the world fish stocks to be over exploited. Aquaculture has {{appeared}} to be the solution for this situation, becoming the essential way of supplying the demand of fish products. However, the traditional aquaculture feed has been composed mainly of fish raw materials. At this moment, one of the main goals of aquaculture is to reduce the utilisation of marine origin ingredients in aquafeeding and to substitute them by vegetable origin material. Those novel diet compositions could introduce new and unexpected undesirables in feed composition, and therefore, arrive to fish organism. The investigation was devoted to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides because of their widespread presence and also motivated by recent European Commission regulations for PAHs and pesticides in foodstuffs. So, the objective of this investigation was to assess the transference of any polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or pesticide present in some diets to fish tissue. For accomplishing this objective, high resolution screening techniques were used: gas chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (GC-(APCI) -QTOF MS) and, ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with electrospray source of ionisation (UHPLC-(ESI) -QTOF MS).

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 In three {{separate}} trials rats were fed either a basal diet deficient in selenium and vitamin E {{or the same}} diet supplemented with {{one or both of}} these factors. In addition to these treatments in two of the trials, <b>ethoxyquin</b> was included to provide adequate lipid antioxidant protection and to alleviate the primary need for selenium and vitamin E in the role of a lipid antioxidant. On termination of either five- or eleven-week feeding trials, the rats were killed, their livers removed and prepared for in vitro studies. These liver preparations (either homogenates or mitochondria preparations) were used to study the metabolic activities of selenium and vitamin E in a NAD- and flavoprotein-dependent system, using pyruvate or succinate as the substrate. Results showed that selenium function was associated with the oxidation of pyruvate by the liver preparations, but not with oxidation of succinate. The inclusion of vitamin E along with selenium in the diet did not significantly increase the oxygen utilization of the pyruvate by animals which were on the test diets for only five weeks. However, by extending the feeding period to eleven weeks and including <b>ethoxyquin</b> in the diets, the combination of both selenium and vitamin E was required to increase the rate of pyruvate oxidation. This suggests that both selenium and vitamin E are biologically necessary in the oxidation of pyruvate and have a function other than that of a lipid antioxidant. This interaction between selenium and vitamin E could not be explained by the lipid antioxidant properties of vitamin E. The presence of <b>ethoxyquin</b> in these diets would be expected to alleviate further requirements of a lipid antioxidant by the animal tissue. In addition, dietary supplementation with vitamin E did not have the same response on pyruvate oxidation as noted by the combination of vitamin E and selenium since the oxygen utilization values with vitamin E lone were not significantly different from the deficient group. If further antioxidants were required for the body tissue, supplementation with vitamin E would be expected to reflect this in the oxidation values. For further proof of selenium function in the oxidative pathways involving pyruvate, sodium malonate was included in the incubation medium. This inhibited the flavoprotein-dependent system and made it possible to observe only the influence of selenium on the NAD-dependent oxidative system. The results from animals receiving <b>ethoxyquin</b> in their diet indicate that supplementation with selenium did not significantly increase the oxidative rate. A slight increase in pyruvate oxidation was noted following the combination of selenium and vitamin E in the diet, but this was not significantly different from the groups not supplemented with both. An investigation into the cause of the non-significant difference due to the inclusion of sodium malonate in the incubation medium revealed that oxaloacetic acid was not in sufficient supply. This probably limited the oxidation of pyruvate to the availability of oxaloacetic acid to combine with the acetyl CoA to form citric acid and did not reflect the extent of the response of selenium on the oxidation of pyruvate. As noted in the first trial, vitamin E exhibited {{a significant increase in the}} oxygen uptake values with succinate as the substrate for the liver homogenates. In later trials this influence was suggested to be not a direct one on the oxidative process involving succinate oxidation since through the inclusion of amytal to isolate the flavoprotein-dependent oxidative system, no difference in the succinate oxidation was noted. The suggestion that certain end-products may have masked the response of vitamin E was discounted since addition of sodium fumarate to the medium containing the amytal did not decrease the oxidation of succinate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have characterised a novel aldo-keto reductase (AKR 7 A 5) from mouse liver that is 78 % {{identical}} to rat aflatoxin dialdehyde reductase AKR 7 A 1 and 89 % {{identical to}} human succinic semialdehyde (SSA) reductase AKR 7 A 2. AKR 7 A 5 can reduce 2 -carboxybenzaldehyde (2 -CBA) and SSA {{as well as}} a range of aldehyde and diketone substrates. Western blots show that it is expressed in liver, kidney, testis and brain, and at lower levels in skeletal muscle, spleen heart and lung. The protein is not inducible in the liver by dietary <b>ethoxyquin.</b> Immunodepletion of AKR 7 A 5 from liver extracts shows that {{it is one of the}} major liver 2 -CBA reductases but that it is not the main SSA reductase in this tissue...|$|E
