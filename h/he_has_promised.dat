25|$|While Romney {{would prefer}} to see passage of federal {{legislation}} or of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion, {{he does not believe}} the public would support such measures; as an alternative, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> to nominate Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v.

25|$|The Saracens have invaded France and {{are laying}} siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant to whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> {{the hand of}} his {{beautiful}} daughter Marsabelle if he can bring to her {{the head of the}} French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant is leaning over the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is leaning over the wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 2004 Mikheil Saakashvili won {{the presidential}} {{elections}} in Georgia {{with more than}} 96% of the votes cast, making him the youngest national president in Europe. On a platform of opposing corruption and improving pay and pensions <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> to improve relations with the outside world. Although he is strongly pro-Western and intends to seek Georgian membership of NATO and the European Union, he has also spoken {{of the importance of}} better relations with Russia. He faced major problems, however, particularly Georgia's difficult economic situation and the still unresolved question of separatism in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Abkhazia regards itself as independent of Georgia and did not take part in the elections, while South Ossetia favours union with its northern counterpart in Russia.|$|E
500|$|However, all is {{not well}} with the love {{triangle}} as the third act opens. The General sent out news of rewards should Fatinitza be found, and has now received word {{that she has been}} found (much to Julian and Wladimir's confusion). As Lydia lives with him, the General, unaware of Wladimir's love for her, but wanting to be alone with Fatinitza, has promised Lydia in marriage to an old, crippled friend of his, who had the advantage of being available for marriage. He does not want to break his word to his friend, but when Wladimir announces <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> his [...] "sister" [...] to one of his friends, the General agrees to break Lydia's betrothal if Wladimir will break Fatinitza's.|$|E

2500|$|In {{gratitude}} Vortigern {{increased the}} rewards <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> to the brothers. Hengist was given [...] "large possessions of lands in Lindsey for the subsistence {{of himself and}} his fellow-soldiers." [...] A [...] "man of experience and subtilty," [...] Hengist told Vortigern that his enemies assailed him from every quarter, and that his subjects wished to depose him and make Aurelius Ambrosius king. He asked the king {{to allow him to}} send word to Saxony for more soldiers. Vortigern agreed, adding that Hengist could invite over whom he pleases and that [...] "you shall have no refusal from me in whatever you shall desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] God shared God's purpose with Noah, saying, [...] "I {{have decided}} {{to put an end}} to all flesh" [...] with the flood, and in an {{internal}} dialogue in [...] God asked, [...] "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do... ? For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is just and right, in order that the Lord may bring about for Abraham what <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> him." [...] Similarly, in [...] the 8th century BCE prophet Amos reported, [...] "Indeed, my Lord God does nothing without having revealed His purpose to His servants the prophets." ...|$|E

2500|$|Land is {{the central}} topic of Joshua. The {{introduction}} to Deuteronomy recalled how Yahweh had given the land to the Israelites but then withdrew the gift when Israel showed fear and only Joshua and Caleb had trusted in God. The land is Yahweh's to give or withhold, {{and the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> it to Israel gives Israel an inalienable right to take it. For exilic and post-exilic readers, the land was both the sign of Yahweh's faithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness, as well as the centre of their ethnic identity. In Deuteronomistic theology, [...] "rest" [...] meant Israel's unthreatened possession of the land, the achievement of which began with the conquests of Joshua.|$|E
2500|$|Romney says a major {{contributor}} to America’s faltering economy has been what he views as excessive regulation. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> to repeal the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Act implemented Wall Street reform with goals that included [...] "improving accountability and transparency in the financial system" [...] and protecting consumers. Romney criticized the Act as being [...] "overwhelming" [...] in length, but he said that one provision, distinguishing between home mortgages and high-risk securities in terms of the capital requirements, [...] "does make sense", and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was enacted to prevent accounting scandals such had occurred with the Enron corporation, with plans to eventually replace them with more streamlined regulations. He also proposes instituting measures that would {{make it more difficult for}} federal agencies to impose new regulations.|$|E
2500|$|As fall 2007 continued, Obama fell {{further behind}} Clinton in {{national}} polls. In late October 2007, {{two months before}} the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, Obama began directly charging his top rival with failing to clearly state her political positions. This shift in approach attracted much media commentary; The New York Times Adam Nagourney wrote that, [...] "Obama has appeared to struggle from the start of this campaign with how to marry what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> to be a new approach to politics—free of the partisan bitterness that has marked presidential campaigns for so long—with what it takes to actually win a presidential race." [...] In an early-anticipated October 30 Democratic debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Clinton suffered a poor debate performance under cross-examination from her Democratic rivals and the moderator. Obama's campaign was reinvigorated, and he began to climb again in the polls.|$|E
