5|$|Dark red, <b>hygroscopic</b> HTcO4 is {{a strong}} acid. In {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid, − converts to the octahedral form TcO3(OH)(H2O)2, the conjugate base of the hypothetical triaquo complex +.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} or cesium fluoride is an {{inorganic compound}} usually encountered as a <b>hygroscopic</b> white solid. It {{is used in}} organic synthesis {{as a source of}} the fluoride anion. Caesium has the highest electropositivity of all non-radioactive elements and fluorine has the highest electronegativity of all elements.|$|E
5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>hygroscopic</b> earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is <b>hygroscopic</b> (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E
5|$|In appearance, {{all forms}} of this {{coenzyme}} are white amorphous powders that are <b>hygroscopic</b> and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable {{for about a week}} at 4°C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis. Upon decomposition, they form products that are enzyme inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are <b>hygroscopic</b> and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated <b>hygroscopic</b> compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are <b>hygroscopic</b> and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|The {{fluorides}} of tantalum can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. Tantalum pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0°C and tantalum pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4°C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly <b>hygroscopic</b> tantalum tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously <b>hygroscopic,</b> becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are <b>hygroscopic,</b> there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, <b>hygroscopic</b> iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable guesses are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} {{solubility}} and <b>hygroscopic</b> nature {{it must be}} kept in a dry environment. The refractive index is about 1.55 at 1.0µm.|$|E
25|$|Liquid ammonia is {{dangerous}} {{because it is}} <b>hygroscopic</b> and because it can freeze flesh. See Gas carrier#Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers for more information.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is <b>hygroscopic.</b> DL-lactic acid is {{miscible}} {{with water}} and with ethanol above its melting point which is around 17 or 18°C. D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a higher melting point.|$|E
25|$|Wood is a heterogeneous, <b>hygroscopic,</b> {{cellular}} and anisotropic material. It {{consists of}} cells, and the cell walls {{are composed of}} micro-fibrils of cellulose (40%– 50%) and hemicellulose (15%– 25%) impregnated with lignin (15%– 30%).|$|E
25|$|Owing to its <b>hygroscopic</b> nature, aerogel feels dry {{and acts}} as a strong desiccant. People {{handling}} aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{retains its}} <b>hygroscopic</b> {{characteristics}} {{after it is}} put into use. It is then subjected to fluctuating humidity, the dominant factor in determining its EMC. These fluctuations may {{be more or less}} cyclical, such as diurnal changes or annual seasonal changes.|$|E
25|$|Barium {{chloride}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula BaCl2. It {{is one of}} the most common water-soluble salts of barium. Like other barium salts, it is toxic and imparts a yellow-green coloration to a flame. It is also <b>hygroscopic.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type of {{reaction}} {{with a strong}} acid releases heat, and hence is exothermic. Such acid-base reactions {{can also be used}} for titrations. However, sodium hydroxide is not used as a primary standard because it is <b>hygroscopic</b> and absorbs carbon dioxide from air.|$|E
25|$|Silica is {{a common}} {{additive}} in food production, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to adsorb water in <b>hygroscopic</b> applications. It is the primary component of diatomaceous earth. Colloidal silica is also used as a wine, beer, and juice fining agent.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} is colorless in {{the form}} of large crystals and white when powdered. It readily dissolves in water with the maximum solubility increasing from 1865 g/L at 20°C to 2705 g/L at 100°C. The crystals are very <b>hygroscopic</b> and gradually disintegrate at ambient conditions. Caesium chloride does not form hydrates.|$|E
25|$|Measuring the {{quantity}} of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy. Remote methods such electromagnetic absorption are possible from satellites above planetary atmospheres. Direct methods may use electronic transducers, moistened thermometers or <b>hygroscopic</b> materials measuring changes in physical properties or dimensions.|$|E
25|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all <b>hygroscopic</b> compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Additionally, many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF4, white, m.p.1068°C) is most easily produced by reacting various thorium salts, thoria, or thorium hydroxide with hydrogen fluoride: methods that involve {{steps in the}} aqueous phase are more difficult because they result in hydroxide and oxide fluorides {{that have to be}} reduced with hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas. It has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. It is a white, <b>hygroscopic</b> powder: at temperatures above 500°C, it reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce the oxyfluoride ThOF2.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{chloride}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula LiCl. The salt {{is a typical}} ionic compound, although {{the small size of}} the Li+ ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar solvents (83.05g/100mL of water at 20°C) and its <b>hygroscopic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|MSG is {{freely soluble}} in water, {{but it is}} not <b>hygroscopic</b> and is {{insoluble}} in common organic solvents (such as ether). It is generally stable under food-processing conditions. MSG does not break down during cooking and, like other amino acids, will exhibit a Maillard reaction (browning) in the presence of sugars at very high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of entomology, ethyl acetate is an {{effective}} asphyxiant for use in insect collecting and study. In a killing jar charged with ethyl acetate, the vapors will kill the collected insect quickly without destroying it. Because it is not <b>hygroscopic,</b> ethyl acetate also keeps the insect soft enough to allow proper mounting suitable for a collection.|$|E
25|$|Advantages of {{consuming}} fiber are {{the production of}} healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber's ability (via its passive <b>hygroscopic</b> properties) to increase bulk, soften stool, and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract. A disadvantage of a diet high in fiber {{is the potential for}} significant intestinal gas production and bloating.|$|E
25|$|The salt {{thiamine}} mononitrate, {{rather than}} thiamine hydrochloride, {{is used for}} food fortification, as the mononitrate is more stable, and does not absorb water from natural humidity (is non-hygroscopic), whereas thiamine hydrochloride is <b>hygroscopic.</b> When thiamine mononitrate dissolves in water, it releases nitrate (about 19% of its weight) and is thereafter absorbed as the thiamine cation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} use is in {{the treatment}} of 'dry rot' or 'white rot' on timber joists, partially rotten or affected wood readily soaks it up and the fungus is subsequently killed. The main advantage of this type of treatment is that the glycol is <b>hygroscopic</b> and the wood being already water damaged readily absorbs a water based product.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} cheap and safe desiccant because of its <b>hygroscopic</b> properties, making salting an effective method of food preservation historically; the salt draws water out of bacteria through osmotic pressure, keeping it from reproducing, {{a major source of}} food spoilage. Even though more effective desiccants are available, few are safe for humans to ingest.|$|E
25|$|Isoquinoline is a colorless <b>hygroscopic</b> liquid at room {{temperature}} with a penetrating, unpleasant odor. Impure samples can appear brownish, as is typical for nitrogen heterocycles. It crystallizes platelets that have a low solubility in water but dissolve well in ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide, and other common organic solvents. It is also soluble in dilute acids as the protonated derivative.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of particulate matter that generally causes visual effects such as smog consists of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, mineral dust, organic matter, and elemental carbon {{also known as}} black carbon or soot. The particles are <b>hygroscopic</b> due {{to the presence of}} sulfur, and SO2 is converted to sulfate when high humidity and low temperatures are present. This causes the reduced visibility and yellow color.|$|E
25|$|Bound or <b>hygroscopic</b> water: Bound {{water is}} bound to the wood via {{hydrogen}} bonds. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free hydroxyl (OH) groups in the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin molecules in the cell wall. The hydroxyl groups are negatively charged. Because water is a polar liquid, the free hydroxyl groups in cellulose attract and hold water by hydrogen bonding.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is <b>hygroscopic,</b> {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed. This high miscibility with water means that ethanol cannot be efficiently shipped through modern pipelines, like liquid hydrocarbons, over long distances.|$|E
25|$|EVOH {{is used in}} {{multilayer}} {{films for}} packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is <b>hygroscopic</b> (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must {{be used as a}} core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.|$|E
25|$|DMT is {{commonly}} handled and stored as a fumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely <b>hygroscopic</b> {{and will not}} readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT fumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point. In contrast to DMT's base, its salts are water-soluble. DMT in solution degrades relatively quickly if not stored protected from air, light, and heat in a freezer.|$|E
