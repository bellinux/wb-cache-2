40|$|Two Apollo 15 {{regolith}} cores - double drive-tube 15010 / 15011 {{and deep}} drill core section 15003 - were compared. The <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> {{was taken from}} {{near the edge of}} Hadley Rille within the mare region and the drill core was taken from the landing site, approximately the same distance as the <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> from the Apennine Front. Optical modes were done on the two cores, each of which was divided into three stratigraphic units defined by minor differences in grain size and modal abundances. Electron microprobe data were collected on the mineral and glass fragments within each unit. Fused-soil-free bulk chemistries were calculated for each unit by modal recombination, using our modal data and average compositional and density data for soil components. It is found that the <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> and drill core section are fairly homogeneous units both chemically and modally. Both soils are submature to immature. There are, however, significant differences between the cores. The drill core shows significant enrichments of highland lithic-fragments and highland-derived minerals and glasses relative to the <b>drive</b> <b>tube.</b> These differences are attributed to the fresh nature of the <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> soil whose major source material is mare basalt ejecta from the shallow bedrock...|$|R
40|$|New modal {{data are}} {{presented}} for continuous polished thin sections from double <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 14210 / 14211, and single <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 14220, and for polished grain mounts of four soils from the double <b>drive</b> <b>tube,</b> {{one from the}} single <b>drive</b> <b>tube,</b> and the soils 14148 (trench top), 14149 (trench bottom), and 14141 (Cone Crater). Modal data show that the Cone Crater soil is immature, whereas the 'smooth plains' soils are mature and rich in agglutinates and breccias. Neither core exhibits any major variations with depth. Microprobe analyses of mineral and glass fragments are consistent with derivation of the soils predominantly from the local rocks, with about 5 - 11 % exotic mare component indicated by the modal data. About 4 % of the glasses are SiO 2 - and K 2 O-rich granitic glasses which are comminuted mesostasis from the local melt rocks. The soils are depleted in feldspar relative to the source rocks. The preferred explanation for this depletion is that feldspar is concentrated in the less than 10 microns fines and is consumed {{in the formation of}} agglutinates, regolith breccias, and feldspathic glass...|$|R

40|$|High {{stagnation}} {{pressures and}} enthalpies {{are required for}} the testing of aerospace vehicles such as aerospace planes, aeroassist vehicles, and reentry vehicles. Among the most useful ground test facilities for performing such tests are shock tunnels. With a given driver gas condition, the enthalpy and pressure in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> nozzle reservoir condition can be varied by changing the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> geometry and initial gas fill pressure. Reducing the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> diameter yields only very modest increases in reservoir pressure and enthalpy. Reducing the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> initial gas fill pressure can increase the reservoir enthalpy significantly, but {{at the cost of}} reduced reservoir pressure and useful test time. A new technique, the insertion of a converging section in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> is found to produce substantial increases in both reservoir pressure and enthalpy. Using a one-dimensional inviscid full kinetics code, a number of different locations and shapes for the converging <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> section were studied and the best cases found. For these best cases, for <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> diameter reductions of factors of 2 and 3, the reservoir pressure can be increased by factors of 2. 1 and 3. 2, respectively and the enthalpy can be increased by factors of 1. 5 and 2. 1, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Papike et al. (1982) have {{provided}} a summary of previous petrologic and chemical studies of the lunar regolith, taking into account samples {{from all of the}} Apollo and Luna sites. On the basis of these studies, an understanding is obtained of the processes which form and characterize the lunar regolith. It is found that comminution of local lithologies by meteorite impact and soil mixing are the most important regolith-forming processes. On the basis of grain size studies of Apollo 14 surface, trench, and <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> soils, Simin et al. (1982) and Laul et al. (1982) concluded that comminution of local lithologies and vertical soil mixing processes are most important {{in the formation of the}} soils at that site. In the present investigation, this study of chemistry and petrology of lunar soils is extended to the Apollo 12 <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 12027. This <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> provides an opportunity to study lunar soil from a depositional environment involving a location at the rim of a crater.

Data are reported on concentrations of solar wind gases, surface-correlated gases (involving solar wind and lunar atmosphere), surface maturity indices, cosmogenic gases, possible soil mixing, and irradiation by cosmic rays. Good correlation is found between solar wind gases in 60009 soils and such surface maturity indices as petrographic agglutinates, magnetic soil fraction, and fine-grained iron. Cosmogenic He- 3, Ne- 21, Ar- 38, Kr- 80, and Xe- 126 all display close correlations in the <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> soils...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out into the replacement of air in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> of a reflected shock tunnel by an N 2 O/N 2 mixture {{in order to increase}} the test time. The incident shock velocities were between 2 and 3 km/sec. Test times were estimated from light emission histories in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> (at distance of L/D = 46. 5 from the main diaphragm) and in the nozzle at an area ratio of 27. 9 and from pressure histories just upstream of the nozzle entrance (at L/D = 54). The test times estimated from the light emission histories in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> showed that consistent increases of 60 - 100 % were obtained upon substituting N 2 O/N 2 for air in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube.</b> These increases were in very good agreement with theoretical estimates. The test times estimated from the light emission histories in the nozzle or pressure histories at the nozzle inlet showed significant improvements with N 2 O/N 2 only for cases where the facility was operated at substantially overtailored conditions. It is believed that {{this is due to the}} greater stability of the driver-driven interface at overtailored operating conditions. At overtailored operating conditions, test times increases of 60 - 100 % with N 2 O/N 2 were observed with all three diagnostic techniques. These increases were in reasonable agreement with theoretical estimates...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{was used to}} study some transient flow features that can occur during the startup process of a shoch tunnel.

The <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> calculations were inviscid {{and focused on the}} study of a vortex system that was seen to form at the driven tube's axis of symmetry. The nozzle flow calculations examined viscous and inviscid effects during nozzle startup. The CFD solutions of the nozzle flows were compared with experimental data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Work {{continued}} on {{the improvement of}} 16 -Inch Shock Tunnel. This comprised studies of ways of improving driver gas ignition, an improved driver gas mixing system, an axial translation system for the driver tube, improved diaphragm materials (carbon steel vs. stainless steel), a copper liner for {{the part of the}} <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> near the nozzle, the use of a buffer gas between the driver and driven gases, the use of N 2 O in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube,</b> the use of a converging <b>driven</b> <b>tube,</b> operation of the facility as a non-reflected shock tunnel and expansion tube, operation with heated hydrogen or helium driver gas, the use of detonations in the driver and the construction of an enlarged test section. Maintenance and developmental work {{continued on}} the scramjet combustor continued. New software which greatly speeds up data analysis has been written and brought on line. In particular, software which provides very rapid generation of model surface heat flux profiles has been brought on line. A considerable amount of theoretical work was performed in connection with upgrading the 16 Inch Shock Tunnel Facility. A one-dimensional Godunov code for very high velocities and any equation of state is intended to add viscous effects in studying the operation of the Shock Tunnel and also of two-stage light gas guns...|$|E

LENS I facility has an 11-inch diameter by 25.5 foot long <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> that is electrically heated with an 8-inch by 60 foot driven section capable of reaching Mach 7 to 18. Test models can have a maximum length of 12 feet and a diameter of 3 feet. The LENS I heats up the drive gas to 750 degrees F to operate at a maximum 30,000 psi.

40|$|Measurements of Al- 26 and Mn- 53 in the Apollo 17 <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 76001 show a clear {{integral}} {{excess of}} activity above expected production {{down to a}} depth of at least 9 gm/sq cm. This excess is interpreted as a continuous accretion of highly irradiated surface material slowly transported downslope by impact or other processes at a buildup rate of 1. 5 cm/m. y. This <b>drive</b> <b>tube,</b> 76001, was collected near a change in slope on the North Massif. Integral excesses have also been observed in other Apollo 16 and 17 cores. Evidence in the Al- 26 and Mn- 53 record for continuous accretion is shown for Apollo 16 cores 60007 and 60010 and the Apollo 16 deep drill string 70009 - 70001.

40|$|The Ames Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) is a {{shock tube}} wherein the driver gas can be heated by an {{electric}} arc discharge. The electrical energy {{is stored in}} a 1. 2 MJ capacitor bank. Four inch and 24 inch diameter driven tubes are available. The facility is described {{and the need for}} testing in the 24 inch tube to better simulate low density NASA mission profiles is discussed. Three test entries, 53, 53 B and 59, are discussed. Tests are done with air or Mars gas (95. 7 % CO 2 / 2. 7 % N 2 / 1. 6 % Ar) at pressures of 0. 01 to 0. 14 Torr. Velocities spanned 6. 3 - 9. 2 km/s, with a nominal center of 7 km/s. Many facility configurations are studied in an effort to improve data quality. Various driver and <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> configurations and the use of a buffer section between the driver and the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> are studied. Diagnostics include test times, time histories of the shock light pulses and tilts of the shock wave off the plane normal to the tube axis.

The performance of the shock tube is found to match well with the theoretically estimated values using normal shock relations. Applications of this shock tube named Reddy tube, include study of blast-induced traumatic brain injuries and high temperature chemical kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{polished}} thin sections from Apollo 17 <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 76001 {{have been}} studied by optical petrography. The entire core {{is found to be}} mature showing little variation in depth, which is consistent with a depositional model involving slow downslope movement of the regolith by mass wasting. However, within the core some major differences are preserved between two stratigraphic units. Unit A (20 - 31 cm depth) is enriched in gabbroic anorthosite relative to unit B (0 - 20 cm depth), while unit B is enriched in KREEPY noritic breccias relative to unit A. This observation is interpreted in terms of a stratigraphy for North Massif involving a noritic breccia unit overlying a unit enriched in gabbroic anorthosite. Pronounced differences between the highland/mare ratios in <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> 76001 and the Apollo 17 drill core separated by only 3. 5 km demonstrate the relative inefficiency of lateral transport as a regolith mixing mechanism on the moon...|$|R

40|$|A {{radiometric method}} for the {{measurement}} of gas temperature in self-absorbing gases has been applied {{in the study of}} shock tube generated flows. This method involves making two absolute intensity measurements at identical wavelengths, but for two different pathlengths in the same gas sample. Experimental results are presented for reflected shock waves in air at conditions corresponding to incident shock velocities from 7 to 10 km/s and an initial <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> pressure of 1 torr. These results indicate that, with this technique, temperature measurements with an accuracy of + or - 5 percent can be carried out. The results also suggest certain facility related problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of a shock-induced detonation driver for enhancing {{the performance of a}} shock tube is described. The detonation wave is induced by the expansion of helium or air. Various gaseous fuel–oxidizer combinations are examined. This method produces a detonation wave which propagates downstream that transitions into a shock wave in the driven section. High-enthalpy flows with a maximum total temperature of 4200 K and a maximum total pressure of 34 atm in the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> are achieved. The problems of achieving the so-called perfectly-driven mode {{as well as those of}} inadequate fuel–oxidizer mixing are discussed. Key words: Shock tube, Detonation driver, High enthalpy...|$|E
40|$|The stress waves {{produced}} by rapid piston deceleration are a fundamental feature of free-piston driven expansion tubes, and wave propagation {{has to be}} considered in the design process. For lower enthalpy test conditions, these waves can traverse the tube ahead of critical flow processes, severely interfering with static pressure measurements of the passing flow. This paper details a new device which decouples the <b>driven</b> <b>tube</b> from the free-piston driver, and thus prevents transmission of stress waves. Following successful incorporation of the concept in the smaller X 2 facility, it has now been applied to the larger X 3 facility, and results for both facilities are presented...|$|E
40|$|Like the Mars Sample Return endeavor, the Apollo lunar-sample {{program began}} with {{definition}} of strategy for sample collection and of scientific requirements for sampling hardware design. Several lessons can be illustrated by specific tools. The evolution of <b>drive</b> <b>tubes</b> from narrow 2 cm diameter, thick-walled tubes (used on Apollo 11, 12 and 14) to 4 cm diameter, thin-walled tubes used on Apollo 15, 16, and 17) {{as an example}} of the improvements made possible during multiple missions. The original Apollo 11 <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> was designed to work in fluffy soil; thus, only 50 percent of the relatively dense lunar soil was recovered, and the core was distorted. The final configuration resulted in nearly 100 pct recovery with little distortion. The surface samplers (Contact Soil Sampling Devices) were designed to collect the upper 100 micrometer or the upper 1 mm of soil. It was over 2 years after the mission before these particularly specific samplers were opened because interest in them waned. Both core tubes and surface samplers were difficult to open in the laboratory. The Apollo Lunar Sample Return Containers (ALSRCs) were constructed with one indium and 2 Viton seals. They were closed on the lunar surface. Interior container pressures measured upon return to the laboratory indicate that these seals were not reliable in the lunar environment. Also, choice of indium as a sealing material interfered with siderophile analyses of samples...|$|R

A table listing all the rocks returned by Apollo 17 by sample number, weight, and rock type is presented. Photographs of lunar samples are included to show the variety of rocks returned. Lunar soils were collected to aid in characterizing the four major photogeologic units determined by preflight studies. Tables are developed to show grain size and grain type for the lunar soils.

Quasi- 1 D simulations can be used to help design experiments, or to better understanding the characteristics of the facility. An application to the design of a nonintrusive diagnostic is shown.

40|$|Polished thin-sections {{of samples}} {{extracted}} from Apollo <b>drive</b> <b>tubes</b> provide unique {{insights into the}} structure of the Moon's regolith at various landing sites. In particular, they allow the mineralogy and texture of the regolith to be studied as a function of depth. Much has been written about such thin-sections based on optical, SEM and EPMA studies, in terms of their essential petrographic features, but there has been little attempt to quantify these aspects from a spatial perspective. In this study, we report the findings of experimental analysis of two thin-sections (64002, 6019, depth range 5. 0 - 8. 0 cm & 64001, 6031, depth range 50. 0 - 53. 1 cm), from a single Apollo 16 <b>drive</b> <b>tube</b> using QEMSCAN. A key feature of the method is phase identification by ultrafast energy dispersive x-ray mapping on a pixel-by-pixel basis. By selecting pixel resolutions ranging from 1 - 5 microns, typically 8, 500, 000 individual measurement points can be collected on a thin-section. The results we present include false colour digital images of both thin-sections. From these images, information such as phase proportions (major, minor and trace phases), particle textures, packing densities, and particle geometries, has been quantified. Parameters such as porosity and average phase density, which are of geomechanical interest, can also be calculated automatically.
