Papers are filed and proceedings are held in secret. Records of the proceedings are kept classified, though copies of the proceedings with sensitive information redacted are very occasionally made public. The government may appeal decisions of the FISCR to the Supreme Court, which hears appeals on a discretionary basis.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} how safe the bridge {{actually}} is, or what its current lifespan is projected to be.

The owner ensures the bridge is capable of safely accommodating all rail traffic operated over the track and specifies the maximum weight the structure can support." [...] There is also no federal law or regulation which requires railroad bridge owners {{to ensure the safety of}} their bridges. Rather, it is FRA [...] "policy" [...] that they do so by following the recommendations contained in the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association's Manual for Railway Engineering and by inspecting bridges annually using trained, experienced inspectors.|$|E
