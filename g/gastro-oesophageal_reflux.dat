Postoperative belching ability, however, {{is difficult to}} assess; subjective patient reporting is often used but may be unreliable. Manometric measurement of the gastro-oesophageal 'common cavity' is an objective marker of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> gas <b>reflux.</b> METHODS: Twenty patients who had undergone Nissen fundoplication and 11 healthy controls underwent oesophageal manometry at rest and during gastric distension for 10 min with 750 ml of gas. RESULTS: Half of the patients reported an inability to belch; the other half reported varying degrees of belching difficulty, {{most of whom were}} rarely able to relieve bloating by belching. During gastric distension, none of the patients had transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, while the controls had a median of 1 (range 0 - 1). Patients had fewer common cavities than controls; however, none of the belch urges experienced during gastric distension in patients was associated with a common cavity, compared with 48 per cent in controls. CONCLUSION: After fundoplication, patients do not belch as a result of gastro-oesophageal gas reflux; rather it may be due to oesophagopharyngeal reflux of swallowed air.

This {{study was designed}} to identify the phenotype of gastric mucosa associated with Barrett's oesophagus. Methods-In this retrospective case control study, the phenotype of the gastric mucosa was histologically characterised in 53 consecutive patients with Barrett's oesophagus and in 53 (sex and age matched) non-ulcer dyspeptic controls. Both patients and controls underwent extensive sampling of the gastric mucosa (two antral, one incisural, and two oxyntic biopsies).

The {{most commonly used}} procedure is the anterior partial fundoplication according to Dor, although during recent years the posterior counterpart (Toupet) has become popular. MethodsPatients with newly diagnosed achalasia and referred for cardiomyotomy were randomised to receive either an anterior or partial posterior fundoplication following a classical cardiomyotomy. The effect of surgery was assessed during the first postoperative year by Eckardt scores, EORTC QLQ-OES 18 scores and HRQL questionnaires. Timed barium oesophagogram (TBO) and ambulatory 24 -h pH monitoring were performed to determine oesophageal emptying {{and the degree of}} reflux control, respectively. ResultsForty-two patients were randomised into Dor (n =  20) and Toupet (n =  22) groups. Eckardt scores improved dramatically with both procedures, but the EORTC QLQ-OES 18 (functional scales) scores revealed significantly better relative improvements in the Toupet group compared to the Dor repair (P =  0. 044). Corresponding advantages in favour of Toupet were observed postoperatively in the percentage of oesophageal emptying at TBO (P =  0. 011 in height and P =  0. 018 in area), an effect not observed in the Dor group. There were no other significant differences recorded between the study groups concerning HRQL evaluations and objective assessment of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> acid <b>reflux.</b> ConclusionsA partial posterior fundoplication after cardiomyotomy seems to achieve more improvement in oesophageal emptying and EORTC QLQ-OES 18 functional scale scores than the anterior fundoplication.

40|$|<b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> acid <b>reflux</b> {{may cause}} airway {{responses}} such as cough, bronchoconstriction and inflammation in asthmatic patients. Our previous {{results suggest that}} microvascular leakage induced, in the guinea-pig airways, by intra-oesophageal hydrochloric acid (HCl) infusion was mainly dependent on the release of tachykinins. Nociceptin, an endogenous ligand of the opioid receptor NOP, {{has been shown to}} inhibit bronchoconstriction and cough in guinea-pig or cat by inhibiting tachykinin release. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of nociceptin on the intra-oesophageal HCl-induced airway microvascular leakage evaluated by Evans blue dye extravasation measurement in anaesthetised guinea-pigs pretreated with propranolol, atropine and phosphoramidon. Infusion of intra-oesophageal HCl led to a significant increase in plasma extravasation in the main bronchi and trachea. This increase was abolished when animals underwent a bilateral vagotomy. Airway microvascular leakage was inhibited by nociceptin (3 – 30 μg kg− 1 i. v.) in a dose-dependent manner (maximal inhibition at the dose of 30 μg kg− 1 : 19. 76 ± 1. 13 vs 90. 92 ± 14. 00 ng mg− 1 tissue for nociceptin and HCl infusion, respectively, in the main bronchi, P< 0. 01). The NOP receptor agonist [Arg 14,Lys 15]N/OFQ mimicked the inhibitory effect of nociceptin, but at a 10 -fold lower dose (3 μg kg− 1 i. v). The NOP receptor antagonist J- 113397 had no effect on plasma protein extravasation by itself, but was able to block the inhibitory effect of nociceptin. Morphine (1 mg kg− 1) had a similar inhibitory effect as that of nociceptin. Naloxone pretreatment abolished the effect of morphine, but was enable to block the inhibitory effect of nociceptin. Under similar conditions, nociceptin, in the previous range of concentration, was unable to counteract the airway microvascular leakage induced by substance P (SP). These results suggest that airway plasma extravasation induced by intra-oesophageal HCl instillation might be inhibited by specific stimulation of the NOP receptor with nociceptin. Nociceptin is likely to act at a pre-junctional level, by inhibiting tachykinin release, since it was unable to prevent SP-induced airway plasma extravasation...|$|R

Aim: To compare oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms in H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive GERD patients during low and profound acid suppression. Methods: Barrett's oesophagus patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> acid <b>reflux</b> were studied by 24 -h oesophageal pH-metry at baseline and during randomized treatment with omeprazole 40 mg b. d. or ranitidine 150 mg b. d. a pylori status was determined by a serum IgG ELISA. Symptoms were scored on a four-graded scale. Results: Of 58 patients, 26 (14 H. pylori-negative, 12 H. pylori-positive) were randomized to omeprazole, 32 (16 H. pylori-negative, 16 H. pylori-positive) to ranitidine. At baseline, oesophageal acid exposure and symptoms did not differ between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive: mean time proportion pH < 4 per 24 h was 16. 1 % (95 % CI 11. 5 - 23. 2) in a pylori-negative, and 15. 8 % (11. 3 - 21. 4) in H. pylori-positive patients. Omeprazole treatment resulted in a decrease of acid reflux per 24 h from 23. 4 % (7. 9 - 39. 3) to 0. 0 % (0. 0 - 2. 9) in a pylori-negative, and from 17. 3 % (8. 9 - 38. 8) to 0. 1 % (0. 0 - 1. 7) in H. pylori-positive patients; ranitidine resulted in a decrease from 14. 4 % (10. 5 - 18. 5) to 9. 3 % (5. 6 - 12. 8) in a pylori-negative, and from 15. 1 % (9. 8 - 21. 0) to 9. 0 % (3. 1 - 20. 1) in H. pylori-positive patients, the difference between H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-positive patients being N.

40|$|Background Oesophageal adenocarcinomas {{including}} adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus (OAC) and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction (OGJAC) {{were previously}} rare tumours; however {{in recent decades}} the incidence has risen faster than all other cancers in developed countries including Australia. Various factors including <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> acid <b>reflux,</b> smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption have all been implicated as risk factors for these cancers although whether the association is causal remains unclear. It has previously been suggested that people who regularly use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may experience lower rates of epithelial cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, including OAC, OGJAC and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A population-based case control study was undertaken to identify major risk factors for oesophageal cancers and to examine associations between exposure to NSAIDs and risk of these cancers. Furthermore it was sought to determine the prevalence of molecular changes in oesophageal adenocarcinomas, especially expression of genes related to metabolism of NSAIDs by staining the tumour tissues to cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) as well as factors related to cell division (p 53 and p 16). Methods In a population-based case-control study in Australia, patients with OAC (N= 367), OGJAC (N= 426) and OSCC (N= 308) were identified through hospitals and cancer registries. Control participants, frequency matched by age, sex and state to the cases, were sampled from a population register (N= 1580). Data for this study were collected from consenting participants through a main study questionnaire and a telephone interview. The main study questionnaire included information on medical and family history, personal behaviors, and exposure to a range of environmental factors during specified periods of life. Interviews conducted by study nurses collected more detailed information concerning timing and frequency of use of therapeutic drugs, and about symptoms and the events leading to diagnosis for cases. Estimation of the relative risks by odds ratio (OR) and their associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI) was done by simple and multivariable analysis using logistic regression models. For the laboratory part of this study 350 tumour blocks related to 161 patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma were obtained from diagnostic laboratories. Sections of tumour tissue were prepared from the blocks and used for immunohistochemical analysis using the p 53, p 16 and COX- 2 antibodies. Staining of the sections was scored in collaboration with a histopathologist to quantify the amount and intensity of positive staining to each of the antibodies. Associations between potential risk factors and negatively- and positively-staining tumours were assessed using case-control analysis and case-case analyses. Cases positive and negative for biomarkers were separately compared with controls and with each other using logistic regression. By doing this analysis ORs were calculated for each biomarker. Results In risk factor analysis it was found that cigarette smoking, obesity and <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> acid <b>reflux</b> increased the risk of OAC. For OGJAC however, the risk increase was found to be slightly higher for smoking and slightly lower for obesity and reflux than was observed for OAC. Alcohol was not found to have a significant association with any type of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, however people who drank 21 or more drinks per week were found to have an increased risk of OSCC. Moreover, smoking was identified to be the strongest risk factor for OSCC. Obesity was not found to be a risk factor for OSCC, in fact being overweight or obese slightly reduced the risk of OSCC. High frequency of reflux was identified as an intermediate risk factor for OSCC. The effect of smoking cessation on reducing the risk of oesophageal cancer was also examined for almost all types of oesophageal cancer and it was identified that; while smoking cessation for more than 20 years reduces the risk, smoking remained a significant risk factor especially for OGJAC and OSCC. Any exposure to NSAIDs was inversely associated with risk of all types of oesophageal cancer. Observed associations did not lose their significance after adjustment for other factors; in fact, associations were slightly strengthened after adjustment. This study found somewhat greater risk reductions among regular users of NSAIDs than occasional users, and there was greater risk reduction among people who used these medications more recently (in the last 10 years) than people who used them in the past (more than 10 years ago). Moreover these analyses revealed a dose response association between total number of the tablets and risk of all type of oesophageal cancer after excluding conditions related to very short periods of consumption (headache and period pain). Finally, for the specific types of medications, there was a suggestion that use of aspirin was associated with greater risk reduction than traditional NSAIDs, and that COX- 2 specific medications were not found to be superior to other NSAIDs in reducing the risk of oesophageal cancer. In the tumour staining studies, expression of p 53 and COX- 2 proteins was noted in over three quarters of tumours; for p 16 a third of the tumour tissues stained positively. This expression level reduced considerably for tissues with dysplasia, staining levels were negligible in normal oesophageal squamous epithelium. No substantial differences were observed in the associations with NSAIDs and other risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma among tumours with and without staining among used antibodies. However a few non-significant differences were observed among immunonegative and immunopositive cases stained for COX- 2 in regards to their exposure to NSAIDs and reflux. Observed ORs for NSAIDs exposure among cases with positive staining was lower than OR observed for negative staining, on the other hand, among cases with daily reflux associations were in the opposite direction with slightly higher OR observed in the immunopositive stratum. Conclusion Smoking, obesity and reflux were identified as independent risk factors for both OAC and OGJAC, and exposure to NSAIDs reduced the risk of oesophageal cancers. For cases with OAC and OGJAC, the risk reduction was more significant for people with history of reflux and to a lower extent among people with history of smoking. The protective effect of NSAIDs against reflux was supported (although weakly) with the findings of the IHC analysis as cases with more positive staining to COX- 2 had more risk reduction for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC and OGJAC combined) by being exposed to NSAIDs. Findings from this observational study therefore support the notion that NSAIDs reduce the risk of oesophageal cancer. A definitive test for this hypothesis can only come from a randomised controlled trial among patients with high risk for oesophageal adenocarcinoma...|$|R

AIM: To trace the rise in {{understanding of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and highlight remaining areas of uncertainty. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: In 1906, Tileston published his observations on 'peptic ulcer of the oesophagus'. Winkelstein, in 1934, first correlated symptoms of heartburn with acid regurgitation and reflux oesophagitis. In 1946, Allison described hiatus hernia as a causal factor {{in the development of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease. In 1958, Bernstein and Baker showed a direct relationship between oesophageal acidification and heartburn in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease, irrespective of endoscopic findings, leading to the recognition of non-erosive <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease. In the 1980 s, continuous recordings of the lower oesophageal sphincter showed that episodes of reflux were related to transient relaxations of lower oesophageal sphincter tone. There is now increasing recognition that <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease arises from the interaction of several anatomical and physiological factors.

Higher anxiety score and higher educational level were associated with the onset of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease, while lower frequency of reflux symptoms and infrequent use of antisecretory therapy were associated with the disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease in a Chinese population. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> {{disease and}} {{irritable}} bowel syndrome are common diseases which may be related. Aim: To examine the association between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} in Chinese population in Hong Kong. Methods: Randomly selected ethnic Chinese {{were invited to participate}} in a telephone survey in 1996. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease was defined as subjects having heartburn and/or acid regurgitation once weekly or more. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome I criteria. The association between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and irritable bowel syndrome was calculated using a statistical model which allows the odds ratio to be measured. Results: One thousand six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate 62 %). The population prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and irritable bowel syndrome were 5 % and 4 %, respectively. Thirteen per cent of subjects with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and 11 % with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The OR of having <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 3 (95 % CI: 1. 05, 6. 27) indicating a positive association between the two diseases. This association occurred predominantly in male subjects [OR = 9. 3, (95 % CI: 2. 3, 26. 2) ] but not as strong in females [OR = 1. 5, (95 % CI: 0. 3, 4. 3) ]. Younger subjects were statistically more prone to the two diseases. Conclusions: There is a positive association between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease and irritable bowel syndrome, and their association occurs predominantly in male subjects. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> {{disease is}} a {{condition}} in which the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus provokes symptoms or complications and impairs quality of life. Typical symptoms of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease are heartburn and regurgitation but <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease can be considered {{as the result of a}} complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The primary aim was {{to assess}} whether there were {{differences}} in symptoms, laboratory data, and oesophageal pH-metry between infants with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and those with reflux secondary to cows' milk protein allergy (CMPA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 infants (mean(SD) age 7. 8 (2. 0) months) with either primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux,</b> reflux with CMPA, CMPA only, or none of these (controls) were studied. Symptoms, immunochemical data, and oesophageal pH were compared between the four groups {{and the effect of}} a cows' milk protein-free diet on the severity of symptoms was also assessed. RESULTS: 14 out of 47 (30 %) infants with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> had CMPA. These infants had similar symptoms to those with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> but higher concentrations of total IgE and circulating eosinophils (p < 0. 005) and IgG anti-beta lactoglobulin (p < 0. 003). A progressive constant reduction in oesophageal pH {{at the end of a}} feed, which continued up to the next feed, was seen in 12 out of 14 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> secondary to CMPA and in 24 of 25 infants with CMPA only. No infants with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and none of the controls had this pattern. A cows' milk protein-free diet was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms only in infants with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> with CMPA. CONCLUSION: A characteristic oesophageal pH pattern is useful in distinguishing infants with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> associated with CMPA...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> and sleep state in 24 infants with confirmed or suspected <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> was studied by monitoring both the pH {{in the lower}} oesophagus and polygraphic tracings made during sleep at night. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> during the night was confirmed in 20 infants. Three hundred and sixteen precipitous drops {{of more than one}} unit of pH were recorded during the studies, 186 during periods of wakefulness. Of 130 drops in pH during sleep, 62 (48 %) began during active sleep and 62 during indeterminate sleep. Of the latter, 56 (90 %) were associated with brief gross body movements. Only five of the drops in pH (4 %) began during quiet sleep. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> stopped during active sleep on 56 occasions (43 %), in indeterminate sleep in 62 (47 %), and in quiet sleep in 12 (9 %). Episodes of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> starting or ending in quiet sleep were uncommon. The occurrence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> during active sleep may partly explain why reflux during sleep is a risk factor for pulmonary disease...|$|E
40|$|Vagal {{function}} in 28 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> was examined by determining gastric secretory response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and pulse-rate variation with respiration. Gastric secretory studies were also performed on 13 patients with duodenal ulcer {{who had not}} undergone operations. In all patients the presence and degree of oesophagitis were determined endoscopically and mucosal biopsy and oesophageal manometry were performed. Seven of the 28 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> showed evidence of impaired vagal efferent {{function in}} the upper alimentary tract. No such impairment was found in those patients who showed manometric evidence of oesophageal spasm secondary to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux.</b> Low pulse-rate variation with respiration was found in 12 of 27 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux,</b> suggesting dysfunction of cardiac vagal fibres. Impairment of efferent vagal supply may be a causative factor in some patients with gastr-oesophageal reflux but {{does not seem to}} be important in oesophageal spasm secondary to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Impedance-pH {{monitoring}} is {{the most}} sensitive method for detection and characterization of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> episodes. Normal values from European subjects are lacking. AIM: To build a database of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> patterns from French and Belgian healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventy-two healthy subjects (35 men, mean age 35 years, 18 - 72) underwent 24 -h ambulatory impedance-pH studies. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> episodes were detected using impedance and characterized by pH as acid, weakly acidic, or weakly alkaline. Analysis was performed visually and effects of age, gender and intra-individual reproducibility were evaluated. RESULTS: The total number of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> episodes was 44 (25, 58, 75) of which 59 % were acid, 28 % were weakly acidic and 10 % weakly alkaline. Half of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> episodes were mixed (liquid/gas) and 22 % reached 15 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. The bolus clearance time was 11 s while acid was chemically cleared in 34 s. Male gender was associated with increased number and proximal extent of total and acid <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux.</b> Repeated studies in 27 subjects showed good reproducibility for number, acidity and air-liquid composition of reflux (Kendall's W-values = 0. 72 - 0. 85). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates good reproducibility of 24 -h ambulatory impedance-pH studies and provides values of reflux patterns in healthy subjects for comparisons with European <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> <b>reflux</b> disease patients. status: publishe...|$|E
