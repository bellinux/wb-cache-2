25|$|Yes then {{signed a}} deal with Frontiers Records and began {{recording}} in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated {{from a pair of}} songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the Drama album. During the recording sessions, the band thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. Fly from Here peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the US.|$|E
25|$|The German {{architect}} and city engineer Conrad Schick, a Jerusalem resident, later published a similar booklet, {{where he also}} detailed his own proposal for a railway, which called for a line through Ramallah and Beit Horon. A route {{along the lines of}} Schick's plan was for a long time considered the most viable, and French engineers conducted an extensive survey to that end in 1874–75. The concept of a railway to Jerusalem was also thought of by the American writer James T. Barclay; he envisioned a line from el-Arish, Askalon or Gaza. Another proposal was made by the engineer Humann, who surveyed the area suggested in 1864 that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> create a railway to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Humayun decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} still further. He and {{his army}} rode out through {{and across the}} Thar Desert, when the Hindu ruler Rao Maldeo Rathore allied with Sher Shah Suri against the Mughal Empire. In many accounts Humayun mentions {{how he and his}} pregnant wife had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year. Their rations were low, and they had little to eat; even drinking water was a major problem in the desert. When Hamida Bano's horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount. Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life.|$|E

500|$|The other {{branch of}} reactor {{development}} at the Argonne National Laboratory, and the one closer to Zinn's heart, was the fast breeder reactor. At {{the time it was}} believed that uranium was a scarce resource, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> make the best use of it. The breeders were designed to create more fissile material than they consumed. By 1948, he had become convinced that it would be unwise to build large experimental reactors near Chicago, and the AEC acquired land around Arco, Idaho, which became an outpost of Argonne. The Experimental Breeder Reactor I (EBR-I, but known at Argonne as [...] "ZIP" [...] — Zinn's Infernal Pile) was the first reactor to be cooled by liquid metal, and the first to produce electricity. It proved the breeder concept. AEC Chairman Gordon Dean described it as a major milestone in nuclear history.|$|E
500|$|Mohamed Heikal, a {{chronicler of}} Egyptian {{national}} policy {{decision making and}} confidant of Nasser, wrote in For Egypt Not For Nasser, that he had engaged Nasser {{on the subject of}} supporting the coup in Yemen. Heikal argued that Sallal's revolution could not absorb the massive number of Egyptian personnel who would arrive in Yemen to prop up his regime, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> consider sending Arab nationalist volunteers from throughout the Middle East to fight alongside the republican Yemeni forces, suggesting the Spanish Civil War as a template from which to conduct events in Yemen. Nasser refused Heikal's ideas, insisting on the need to protect the Arab nationalist movement. [...] Nasser was convinced that a regiment of Egyptian Special Forces and a wing of fighter-bombers would be able to secure the Yemeni republican coup d'état.|$|E
500|$|The {{place of}} Cyrene within the poem has {{implications}} beyond {{the level of}} content, for if her narrative is {{to be connected to}} the city of Cyrene in Libya, the terminus post quem for the composition of the Catalogue would be 631 BC, the approximate year of that city's foundation. Pindar, Pythian 9 tells how Apollo saw Cyrene hunting in her native Thessaly and was immediately enamoured of the tomboy. The god goes to the cave of the wise centaur Chiron and asks who she is and whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> consort with her. Chiron then prophesies that it is fated for Cyrene and Apollo to mate, and that he will bring her across the sea to Libya, where she will be queen of a portion of the land and bear to him a son, Aristaeus. A scholium on the ode states that [...] "Pindar took the story from an Ehoie of Hesiod's" [...] (...) and relates the opening lines of the section (Cat. fr. 215): ...|$|E

500|$|Even at {{this stage}} the true purpose of the site was unclear. Claims {{that it had been}} {{intended}} to be used for [...] "electro-magnetic projectors" [...] (railguns), firing huge shells at London, [...] were debunked by Lord Cherwell, Winston Churchill's scientific adviser, who calculated that it would take sixty times the output of Battersea Power Station to fire a one-ton shell. Sanders' investigation brought to light the V-3 project for the first time, to the alarm of the British government. He concluded that although the site had been damaged it [...] "could be completed or adapted for offensive action against this country at some future date, and [...] destruction is a matter of importance." [...] Sandys brought the matter to the attention of Churchill and advised: [...] "Since this installation constitutes a potential threat to London, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> ensure that it is demolished whilst our forces are still in France." [...] Churchill later commented that the V-3 installation at Mimoyecques [...] "might well have launched the most devastating attack of all on London." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} the tunnel {{collapsed}} there were a total of 15 people and five items of plant inside. [...] According to the Railway Inspectorate report, shortly before 3:45am the duty Railway Works Inspector noticed some small pieces of rock flaking away from the tunnel wall, approximately 90 metres from the southern portal. He decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> shore up the affected piece of the tunnel and was making his way towards the site office to arrange this {{when he heard the}} sound of the tunnel collapsing behind him.|$|E

[...] Premier Peter Lougheed decided to call a snap election to catch fledgling new parties off guard, most notably the separatist Western Canada Concept which was capitalizing on anger over Lougheed's perceived weakness in dealings with the federal government, in particular his acceptance of the hugely unpopular National Energy Program. [...] The WCC's Gordon Kesler had won a by-election earlier in the year, and Lougheed decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> <b>to</b> stage a showdown with the WCC sooner rather than later.|$|E
