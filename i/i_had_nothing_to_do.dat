500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how it feels to be an ornament. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E
500|$|Crews began hanging {{the sign}} in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted {{that part of the}} problem is the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Russel Wallace, {{a naturalist}} {{working as a}} {{specimen}} collector in Borneo, spent Christmas 1854 visiting Sir James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak, then during the ensuing rainy season lived alone in a little Dayak house, with only one Malay servant as cook. He recalled, [...] "during the evening and wet days, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but look over my books". He had already read Lyell's Principles of Geology which opposed Lamarck by arguing that the fossil record showed no progress, and the 1845 second edition of Darwin's Journal of Researches which hinted at evolution by describing the [...] "wonderful relationship in the same continent" [...] between fossil and extant species, which would [...] "throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts", and how species unique to the Galápagos Islands [...] "all show a marked relationship with those of America" [...] despite its distance.|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and I can look at it like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E

2500|$|Lawyers {{convinced}} LAPD {{to allow}} Simpson to turn himself in at 11a.m. on June 17, 1994, although the double murder charge meant that no bail {{would be set}} and a first-degree murder conviction {{could result in a}} death penalty. More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2p.m., LAPD issued an all-points bulletin. At 5p.m., Robert Kardashian, a friend of Simpson's and one of his defense lawyers, read a letter by Simpson to the media. In the letter Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, [...] "First everyone understand <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Nicole's murder ... Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life." [...] Some interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother Eunice collapsed after hearing it, and reporters joined the search for Simpson. Simpson's lawyer Robert Shapiro was present at Kardashian's press conference and said that Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Over the television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender.|$|E
