500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|Bridges left Brackley in {{the summer}} and signed for Northern Premier League side King's Lynn Town in May 2014. On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m probably very, very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family". On his retirement, manager Setchell said “David will be missed {{by a lot of people}} at the football club but <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> understand his decision to call it a day on his fantastic playing career and pursue his business interests and spend more time with his young family.” ...|$|E

Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, {{said that they had}} passed a lie detector test [...] "with flying colors". Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to {{deal with the fact that}} I had some mental illness... <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> lost touch with reality...

500|$|Still, in the World Series against Colorado, he did {{not start}} the team's away games. Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis, 120-RBI man Mike Lowell, or 117-RBI man David Ortiz, as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base. Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it [...] "the most {{difficult}} decision any American League manager has had {{to make in the}} 34-year history of the DH". Youkilis said, [...] "It doesn't bother me. I want to play, but <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> understand the situation. Look, I'm doing everything I've always wanted to do. I'm playing in a World Series. I'm playing every day. I'm happy. I just want to win.... If I have to take a seat, that's just the way it has to be." [...] Youkilis hit two doubles (both in Game 1) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4-game win over Colorado, as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games. Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series, Youkilis said, [...] "Move on and go to another team if you’re worried about your playing time, and think you deserve to play over somebody else." ...|$|E

[...] Syco also responded to the claim, stating that Avicii was always going to work with Lewis, and that he would be credited on the song. In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking on my behalf. Since we never met or even spoke, please let me and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer... We've finally come to an agreement with Leona on all the issues... So happy to move on and focus on hit making... So happy to move on with Leona and focus on having a hit together."

Describing himself as a “notorious critic” of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: [...] "New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank are saying that we need to get away from , but <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> disagree. We need to enshrine it so that cultural land-owning groups or land-stewarding groups never lose control of the resource".

2500|$|In {{the same}} game, Crisp reached base {{in his next}} at-bat, and {{attempted}} to steal 2nd Base once again.

Crisp was out on the play. Rays manager Joe Maddon engaged in a heated argument with Crisp upon Maddon making a mound visit, Crisp being in the Red Sox dugout at that time.

2500|$|Brothers in Arms was {{recorded}} from November 1984 to March 1985 at AIR Studios {{on the island}} of Montserrat, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean.

In 1982, Knopfler asked Dorfsman to work with him on the 1982 Dire Straits album, Love over Gold, and his 1983 soundtrack album Local Hero. Brothers in Arms {{was one of the first}} albums recorded on a Sony 24-track digital tape machine. The decision to move to digital recording came from Knopfler's constant striving for better sound quality. [...] "One of the things that <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> respected about him," [...] Dorfsman observed, [...] "was his interest in technology as a means of improving his music.

The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> agreed with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|E
