500|$|Warner made no {{pretense of}} {{faithfulness}} to his wife, Ann, and kept {{a series of}} mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these [...] "girlfriends" [...] was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a [...] "startling" [...] resemblance to Warner's second wife. [...] The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. [...] Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor Eddie Albert in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast. [...] In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. [...] In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, My First Hundred Years in Hollywood, Ann Warner wrote: [...] "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> he covers it with a cloak." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–", applauded Duchovny's apparent energy to be acting on the series once again. However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "overtness" [...] of the episode resulted in many scenes coming off as too on-the-nose or strained. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– rating but slightly criticized the way Fox was using Duchovny, sardonically writing, [...] "I don't know if you're aware of this, but David Duchovny stars in The X-Files. Did you <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Because</b> they've really been keeping it under wraps at Fox." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating. Keegan called the episode a [...] "homage to fandom" [...] and described the tone as [...] "warm [...] fuzzy." [...] Because of this, he concluded that [...] "verall, this was an episode that dealt with the emotional needs of the audience {{in a way that was}} less effective than it might have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his {{identity}} was made public, people sent him care packages, including lots of cigarettes; President George W. Bush sent cigars, candy and memorabilia from the White House. [...] The forward command center soon featured a large blowup of the photo. [...] The Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division, Richard F. Natonski, made a special trip to see Miller, to Miller's surprise. The general shook Miller's hand {{and let him}} <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> Americans had [...] "connected" [...] with his photo, and nobody {{wanted to see him}} wounded or dead, he was offered a trip home. Miller turned down the offer because {{he did not want to}} leave his comrades behind.|$|E
3000|$|I don’t think {{everyone}} is well connected. I <b>know</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>because</b> not everyone <b>knows</b> what’s {{happening in the}} community. You know there can be an initiative happening in West Auckland and I would never know about it. (Tongan, female) [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Anna goes to {{work for}} wealthy ranchers. When their young son who is Anna's age comes to visit he is enamoured of her and the two sleep {{together}} resulting in Anna becoming pregnant. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he is white, the rancher's son will never marry her she leaves again. She goes to Grasse where the Reubens take in [...] "wayward girls" [...] until they can have their children and give them up for adoption.|$|R
2500|$|Aesthetics aside, the {{wardrobe}} {{was designed to}} reflect key plot developments. In Attack of the Clones, Lucas wanted Padmé's wardrobe to mirror the romantic elements of the film. He suggested that her costumes be more [...] "sultry in nature." [...] Trisha Biggar notes that Lucas wanted her to appear [...] "sexy, gorgeous, and young in skimpy clothes." [...] Portman laughs, [...] "I got over the hump of 18 so I'm allowed to show tummy now, I guess.", so {{during the battle of}} Geonosis the bottom part of her top is ripped off revealing her midriff. For Revenge of the Sith, Biggar says, [...] "We knew that Padmé was going to be pregnant through the whole film, and nobody in the outside world could <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Because</b> she's pregnant, I wanted a soft quality to be apparent in the fabrics that were used." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, he did,' said Bill. 'I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he lost {{it all the}} day after, in six-and-twenty banks as broke. He {{settled a}} lot of the notes on his father, when it was ascertained that they was really stopped and sent 'em over with a dutiful letter. I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> they was shown down our yard for the old gentleman's benefit, that he might treat himself with tobacco in the workus.' ...|$|E

50|$|After {{an ambush}} mission {{during which the}} unit wipes out a Japanese squad, Tom's aide, Bye Ya, is {{severely}} wounded. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> they have no morphine Bye Ya (Guy Lee) will die a lingering, painful death, Tom shoots him, dismaying Danny. Tom then angrily contacts army headquarters in Calcutta and demands to meet with his commanding officer. A few days later in Calcutta, Tom and Danny are met by Corporal Bill Ringa (Steve McQueen), who has been assigned as their driver.|$|R
50|$|In {{an event}} {{unaffected}} by the Soviet-led boycott, the Americans would battle a talented West German relay team including the 200-meter freestyle world record holder, Michael Gross. The U.S. coaches decided to capitalize on Hayes' finishing ability by having him take the final leg behind teammates Mike Heath, David Larson and Jeff Float. However Hayes <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> his best 200m freestyle time was three seconds slower than Gross', he would need a three-second lead upon starting the relay to guarantee a win.|$|R
30|$|The near-fault seismograms of {{vertical}} strike-slip earthquakes {{are very important}} for directly measuring the earthquake source properties. It is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of very little excitation of Rayleigh waves (Okada 1992; Zhang and Chen 2006), the free surface effect becomes negligible and the “Method of Images” {{can be applied to}} compute the fault slip history in full space. Then, the observed near-fault seismogram for a vertical strike-slip event can be considered as if it is observed at the middle of the fault at depth.|$|R

60|$|JAMES. Exactly; he {{therefore}} {{gave the}} cheque to Davis. It was cashed by you at 1.15. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the cashier recollects {{it for the}} last cheque he handled before his lunch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--allow me. I {{should be}} too bold were I {{to ask you}} to return my love at once. I only ask you to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I was repulsed once, I have not given up the pursuit." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{standing}} {{in the door of}} his lonely homestead, he glanced at the great shadowy granaries and barns, and clenched his hand as he saw what he could do if the things that had been forced upon him were rightfully his. He knew his own mettle, and that he could hold them if he would, but the pale, cold face of a woman rose up in judgment against him, and he also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the love of her, that was casting its toils about him, he must give them up.|$|R

25|$|Haig <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of {{manpower}} constraints the BEF {{would soon be}} cut from 61 divisions to 42 (10 {{of them from the}} Dominions) and that Pershing was withdrawing three of the five US divisions serving on the British sector. By this time Haig was keen to preserve the strength of the Canadian Corps, ordering them not to attack the Drocourt-Queant position unless sure of taking it, and the cavalry. In late August-early September the Germans had been driven back 15 miles and 40,000 prisoners taken, but at the cost of 80,000 casualties and Haig was aware that immediate decisive victory was unlikely.|$|R

50|$|This {{short story}} {{is simply a}} wander through Destiny's garden of forking paths. Based on the clothes of Delirium's statue {{in one of the}} panels and the posture of Dream's statue, it seems to be taking place during The Kindly Ones. This story was {{originally}} to be illustrated by Moebius. Neil Gaiman <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of his age and health, the artist {{would not be able to}} give much of a time commitment so he designed this story to be short and full of full page pictures. In the end, sickness prevented Moebius from working on the story and Frank Quitely filled in.|$|R
5000|$|He {{received}} his education at Eton and Sandhurst. He attained {{the rank of}} captain and was posted to the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. During service with the regiment in the Korean War he lost his left leg in an explosion. Sutherland later recounted the event: [...] "Going up a hill, {{one of the four}} troops I was with tripped the wire of a landmine and set off the blast. I was the only one badly injured". A soldier who was with him declared 'You're OK, Mr Fergie, it's only the leg'. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> I had already checked".|$|R
5000|$|In the past, the baths {{served as}} {{community}} spaces for gay men. Even now, some men {{choose to go}} to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other). While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity. But I’ve been to a sauna recently in New Zealand, where everyone just chatted away, which I found very strange. Um, but you <b>know,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>because</b> I guess it was a smaller city and people generally knew each other. [...] "S Alfred" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because I know already," [...] {{answered}} Ujarak, [...] "that {{you come}} from the far-away there," [...] pointing southward; [...] "and I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> I am an angekok.

6000|$|... "Don't you? Well, I do," [...] de Cartienne remarked drily. [...] "Grumps {{is going}} over to Belscombe this evening to take the chair at the {{literary}} society there. He'll have to dine at six and leave at a quarter to seven. I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> I heard him give his orders.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fumes from diesel engines make an important contribution to atmo-spheric pollution. This is probably because they are sometimes highly irritant and sometimes very smoky. It is well <b>known</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of their comparatively low carbon monoxide content, these fumes are much less lethal than those from petrol engines. The leading work on diesel fumes has been done by the U. S. Bureau of Mines. Holtz, Berger, Elliott, and Schrenk (1940) analysed the fumes from engines in proper mechanical conditions, plotting the carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and aldehyde content against fuel-air ratio. The present work was directed to ascertaining what were the main toxic constituents of diese...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Cell", Negan's henchman Dwight {{leaves a}} picture of Glenn's mangled corpse in Daryl's cell, where he is being held captive, to torment him. In [...] "Go Getters", Glenn and Abraham are shown to be buried {{together}} at Hilltop. In [...] "The Other Side", Maggie remarks to Daryl that he hasn't spoken a word to her ever since he returned to the Hilltop. Crying, Daryl apologizes to Maggie for unintentionally causing Glenn's death. Maggie resolutely maintains Daryl wasn't to blame, saying <b>that</b> Glenn <b>knew</b> Daryl was [...] "one {{of the good things}} in this world" [...] and she <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> Glenn was [...] "one of the good things too".|$|R
50|$|But what Jung-won doesn't <b>know</b> is <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the hospital's negligence, she was {{switched}} {{at birth}} with another baby, Hwang Geum-ran (Lee Yoo-ri).

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Lord Runton answered, [...] "but {{they were}} all in code. I happen to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the {{postmaster}} brought the first one up himself, and explained that he was afraid that he must have made some mistake as the message was incomprehensible. Fielding only laughed, and gave the man a sovereign. The message was absolutely correct, he declared. He told me afterwards that whenever he was speculating he always coded his messages, and it seemed perfectly reasonable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Bill. 'New York. I <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he {{sent word}} home that it brought Old York to his mind, quite vivid, in {{consequence}} of being so exactly unlike it in every respect. I don't understand what particular business Ned turned his mind to, {{when he got}} there; but he wrote home that him and his friends was always a-singing, Ale Columbia, and blowing up the President, so I suppose it {{was something in the}} public line; or free-and-easy way again.
