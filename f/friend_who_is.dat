25|$|After {{leaving the}} service, Hogan {{returned}} to the film industry, {{but only for a}} short time. In 1947 he appeared in a featured role in Blaze of Noon, starring Anne Baxter and William Holden. In 1948 he was featured in two more films: Beyond Glory, starring Alan Ladd and Donna Reed; and Shed No Tears, starring Wallace Ford and June Vincent. Even though it was the first film he worked on in 1948, his final on-screen performance was in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. In it, Hogan played the crucial role of David Kentley, the erstwhile <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> strangled {{at the beginning of the}} picture and whose body is hidden in a chest while the murderers' guests have dinner in the same room. Hogan's final acting appearance was on the Broadway stage, in the unsuccessful comedy, Time for Elizabeth, which ran for only 8 performances at the Fulton Theatre in September–October 1948.|$|E
25|$|Netherland {{opens on}} protagonist Hans van den Broek, a Dutch {{financial}} analyst living in London with his English wife Rachel, but quickly flashes {{back to the}} years Hans spent in New York City before and {{in the immediate aftermath}} of 9/11. At the beginning of the novel, Hans is preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and making big, optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by Chuck’s magnetic ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with his Trinidadian <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> discovered, years later, simply a body, handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.|$|E
