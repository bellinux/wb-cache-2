40|$|Three design {{tradeoff}} {{relations for}} noise control, namely control for ground bounce noise, control for crosstalk noise, and control for reflection noise, in signal integrity for MOS-based systems are discussed here. Both long-channel modeled MOST (MOS 1) and short-channel modeled MOST (MOS 3) {{are used to}} derived tradeoffs between performance parameters and electrical parameters for a lumped modeled ground-path inductance. Quantitative expressions relating driver size, loading capacitance, edge speed of input signal, parasitic inductance, and a maximum number of allowable simultaneously switching drivers to the worst-case, maximum ground bounce and the signal switching (delay) time are shown to agree with SPICE simulations for both MOS 1 and MOS 3 devices. Dependent upon the strength of line coupling, two design guidelines to design interconnect systems for targets of 4 % far-end overshoot, 10 % <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk,</b> and a pre-specified far-end response time are introduced to upgrade package performance and packaging density. A low-frequency approximation associated with a second-order Butterworth response is the foundation to control far-end overshoot for the single-mode excitation, and/or for the mixed-mode excitation with weakly coupled lines. An average-transfer-function method is introduced for calculating the required output impedance of source (driver) when multiple modes are excited for strongly coupled lines. It is shown that the far-end response can be significantly improved with reliable operation if the output impedance {{is designed to be}} less than the line impedance according to the proposed approach. The near-end and the <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> are derived for capacitive far-end and resistive (unmatched) near-end terminations on both the driven and the quiet lines. A simple <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> estimate assuming a low line loss, weak line coupling, and a small capacitive load is first derived based on multiple reflections of backward coupling noise from mis-matched terminations. This simple estimate ensures controlled crosstalk for weakly coupled cases. Derivations in the frequency and the time domain of two limits, namely the high-frequency and the low-frequency approximation, for the <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> then are followed for heavily-loaded, lossy lines, and/or strong line coupling. Compared to SPICE calculations, It is shown that these two limits can serve as a upper bound and a lower bound for the <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> estimate. To estimate the signal delay time, a simple expression that combines the propagation delay time and the far-end Z(0) G(L) time is formulated first. The Elmore delay time for a single line provides a good delay estimate for a signal propagating on loosely coupled lines. For strongly coupled lines, a modified Elmore delay time with a coupling factor is derived, which agrees well with SPICE calculations. Design curves for targets of 4 % far-end overshoot and 10 % <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> are given, and design guidelines, based on a second-order polynomial approximation and least-squares data fitting, are introduced for strongly-coupled lines. SPICE simulations for systems designed using these guidelines agree very well with the design targets, namely a 4 % far-end overshoot and a 10 % <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk.</b> Based upon the assumption that both unsealed and scaled systems satisfy the proposed design guidelines, possible scaling tradeoffs for down-sized (scaled) systems also are examined extensively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Crosstalk between {{neighbouring}} wire pairs in multi-pair copper cables {{has long}} been seen as an major source of disturbance that es-sentially limits the transmission quality and the throughput of such cables. However, van Ettens pioneering work has shown that multi-pair copper cables can be treated as MIMO (multiple input multiple output) channels and tremendous perfor-mance improvements are possible if appropriate signal processing is applied. For high-rate trans-mission, often the strong near-end crosstalk (NEXT) disturbance is avoided or suppressed and only the <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> (FEXT) remains as crosstalk influence. Therefore in this contribution, the effects of FEXT in iteratively detected and SVD-assisted MIMO-OFDM transmission schemes are studied. Contrary to the cancellation of the crosstalk, which has achieved a level of maturity, the <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> paths are viewed as additional transmis-sion paths, which together with the wanted signal path convey the signal from the near to the far cable end.

Many twisted-pair {{systems such}} as fiber-to-the-curb, very high-speed digital subscriber line, and high-speed LAN systems, use frequency-division duplexing (FDD) for duplex transmission. It is shown that the maximum reach of FDD twisted-pair system {{is limited by the}} performance of its upstream channel, which is assumed to be located at higher frequencies than the downstream channel. In order to improve the performance of such FDD transceiver, FEXT cancellation is introduced for the channel at higher frequencies. A system arrangement and its blind startup procedure are studied when the FEXT canceller and equalizer are jointly adapted to combat channel intersymbol interference, FEXT, and other additive noise. We investigate the initial convergence and the steady-state behavior of the proposed twisted-pair system without requiring transmission of an ideal training sequence. Measured characteristics as well as analytical model of the FEXT channel are used to estimate the time span needed for the FEXT canceller. It is also shown that the memory span for the FEXT canceller is almost independent of the channel, thus making our results useful for the twisted-pair system over all different channels.

The minimum {{mean square error}} (MMSE) linear equalizer is derived in the presence of both near- and <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and independent additive noise, assuming correlated data, and col-ored noise. The MMSE equalizer is completely specified in terms of the channel and crosstalk transfer functions by using a generalization of previous work due to Salz. Conditions are given under which the equalizer can completely eliminate both near- and <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and intersymbol interference. The MMSE transmitter filter, subject to a transmitted power con-straint, is specified when the channel and crosstalk transfer functions are bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency.

For a particular two-input/two-output dis-crete-time channel model, we study the behavior of the MMSE, assuming FIR transmitter and receiver filters, as a function of how the matrix taps are allocated between these filters, and on timing phase.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{fabricate}} a magnetic film between the coplanar transmitted stripline for crosstalk suppression. Crosstalk is caused from undesired inductive and capacitive coupling of signals between two conductors. The effective crosstalk suppression results from the inductive coupling of circuit elements through the lossy properties of magnetic material during ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Several techniques were used to fabricate ferrite films, including ferrite plating, screen printing, and pressure die casting. Ferrite plating produce nanostructured zinc iron oxide (ZnFe₂O₄) films with lower crystallinity and do not exhibit cross talk suppression. Interesting, the films show a higher roughness with increasing film thickness. The contact angle measurement indicates the films changing from hydrophobic to hydrophilic with increasing film thickness. Screen printing was used to fabricate yttrium iron garnet (Y₃Fe₅O₁₂) films to replace ferrite plating zinc ferrite films, because of the magnetic properties of yttrium iron garnet film. The results show that screen-printed films can achieve <b>far-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> suppression by 10 12 dB, however, no suppression effect for near-end crosstalk.
