5|$|Harry Woods, the {{publisher}} of the other major newspaper, The Daily Nugget, was an undersheriff to Behan. He and <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> tended to side with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners), and the rural interests of the ranchers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E
5|$|During his life, H.P.N. Muller {{published}} {{well over}} 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these – especially <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> articles – were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles {{he wrote about}} the South African War when he was consul general for the Orange Free State were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton nearly {{failed to}} make the trip. <b>His</b> <b>newspaper</b> editor Eric Baume ordered to write a column attacking the Australian Board of Control for vetoing players from going on a private tour of India, {{threatening}} to sack him if he refused—criticism of the board typically resulted in exclusion from selection. Fingleton was reluctant to comply, and was reprieved when the editor-in-chief overruled Baume.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed {{spoke for}} a liberal {{faction of the}} Whigs in <b>his</b> <b>{{newspaper}}</b> the Albany Evening Journal. He hired Greeley {{as editor of the}} state Whig newspaper for the upcoming campaign. The newspaper, the Jeffersonian, premiered in February 1838 and helped elect the Whig candidate for governor, William H. Seward. In 1839, Greeley worked for several journals, and took a month-long break to go as far west as Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Now outside Parliament, Odlum {{maintained}} {{his presence in}} the public eye through meetings and the work of <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> The Crusader. His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election, when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory. In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton, his old enemy, holding it for only a year. When Compton resigned in 1996, Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton had a {{difficult}} childhood, forced to leave formal education {{at the age of}} 12 to support his family {{after the death of his}} father. He worked in a series of odd jobs before joining the media at the age of 15. He gradually progressed in <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> and cricket career. After making his first-grade debut in Sydney district cricket at the age of 16, he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the age of 20 in 1928–29. However, Fingleton struggled to establish himself at interstate level, and was unable to maintain a regular position in the team, playing in only seven matches in his first three seasons.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Hinde was {{an active}} businessman, {{pursuing}} real estate, construction, and publishing opportunities in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. In his early years, Hinde publicly opposed slavery. He also used <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> The Fredonian, in Chillicothe, Ohio between 1806 and 1808, to highlight issues about Indian treaties and the conspiracy of Aaron Burr. He served in the War of 1812. In later years he was {{a pioneer in the}} settlement of Indiana and Illinois, and the expansion of the Methodist Church in these areas. He contributed to the Madoc Tradition and was a noted historian and biographer. Hinde cofounded the Wabash Navigation Company, which engaged in real estate speculation and dam construction. The company dammed the Wabash River next to Hinde's property, creating the Grand Rapids Dam. The dam was abandoned by the Federal government in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Wheeler joined Bradford Grammar School {{shortly before}} his ninth birthday, where he {{proceeded}} straight to the second form. In 1902 Robert and Emily had a second daughter, whom they named Betty; Mortimer showed little interest in this younger sister. In 1905, Robert agreed to take over {{as head of the}} London office of <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> by then renamed the Yorkshire Daily Observer, and so the family relocated to the southeast of the city in December, settling into a house named Carlton Lodge on South Croydon Road, West Dulwich. In 1908 they moved to 14 Rollescourt Avenue in nearby Herne Hill. Rather than being sent for a conventional education, when he was 15 Wheeler was instructed to educate himself by spending time in London, where he frequented The National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
5|$|Washington countered Trotter's attacks with {{a variety}} of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, {{including}} at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others. Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice. As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{missed the}} first Test, worn out by {{constant}} cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control. The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> employers released him from his contract. England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness. Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by {{members of his own}} side such as Vic Richardson, but refused to consider doing so.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Fingleton was an {{overlooked}} for the Australian side {{selected to}} tour England in 1934. With captain Woodfull and Bill Ponsford the established openers, {{there was only}} one place for a spare opener, and Brown won the position over his partner, who had performed to a similar standard during the season. The selectors asked Don Bradman, Australia's leading batsman and state teammate to Brown and Fingleton, for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. On the day that the team was selected, Bradman wrote in <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> column, criticising Fingleton's running between the wickets. When the pair next met, Fingleton's only words were to blame Bradman for his omission; Bradman claimed {{that as a result of}} the selection controversy, Fingleton relentless pursued a vendetta against him from there on. Fingleton also suspected that Woodfull wanted him out of the team because he held the journalist responsible for the leaked exchange with Warner.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>newspaper</b> Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser {{was highly}} {{critical}} of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E

Shortly after Eberhardt euthanises him, the wife of Marquis de Mores summons her to Paris. de Mores has {{disappeared}} in North Africa, and his wife wished to hire Eberhardt to track him down, as she is familiar with the region. Eberhardt arrives in Algiers, where she approaches newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand (Claude Villers). He is interested in her writing for <b>his</b> <b>newspaper,</b> though advises her to abandon the search for de Mores on the grounds it is hopeless. The French authorities are threatened by her search efforts and confront her about them. Despite that she has already {{come to the conclusion that}} de Mores is dead, the French garrison forbid her from traveling further from Algiers. Eberhardt falls in love with Slimene (Tchéky Karyo), a French Foreign Legion soldier, who arranges for her to travel out in secret.|$|E
