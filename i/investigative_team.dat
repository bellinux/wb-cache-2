5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his <b>investigative</b> <b>team</b> to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|The {{communications}} between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite, provide {{the only significant}} clues {{to the location of}} Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT. These communications have also been used to deduce possible in-flight events (see next section). The <b>investigative</b> <b>team</b> was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the <b>investigative</b> <b>team</b> believed that it probably reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In {{the case of the}} older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the tooth enamel was worn away and the dentine had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.|$|E

It noted that proper communications nets were lacking, and personnel {{had not been}} thoroughly trained in forward air control techniques. They also calculated that supporting every Army division with 216 aircraft per Marine Corps practice was financially impossible. The Higgins report, which pointed out Army deficiencies, was ignored when Almond submitted a report more favorably received by higher headquarters.|$|E

25|$|An <b>investigative</b> <b>team</b> {{of up to}} 70 {{officers}} from 8 different police agencies formed the Integrated Riot Investigation Team, which was tasked with sifting through {{hundreds of hours of}} video and other evidence to determine the identity of those {{who took part in the}} riot. Several participants in the riots turned themselves in to police after their faces were broadcast on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. More than 1,000,000 photos and 1,200 – 1,600 hours of video recorded by citizens were sent to the Vancouver Police Department as evidence. , police had recommended 1,204 criminal charges against 352 suspected rioters. In July 2015, over four years after the riots, the last two suspects were charged. By then, a total of 887 criminal charges had been laid against 301 suspects, 274 of whom pled guilty. However police said they would continue to act on any tips they are provided and future charges could be laid.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the index case was a two-year-old boy {{who lived in the}} village of Meliandou, Guéckédou located in the Nzérékoré Region of Guinea. Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin believe the boy {{contracted}} the virus while playing near a tree that was a roosting place for free-tail bats infected with the virus. Dr Fabian Leendertz, an epidemiologist who was part of the <b>investigative</b> <b>team,</b> said Ebola virus is transmitted to humans either through contact with larger wildlife (gorillas, monkeys), or by direct contact with bats. The boy, later identified as Emile Ouamouno, fell ill on 2 December 2013 and died four days later. The boy's sister fell ill next, followed by his mother and grandmother. It is believed the Ebola virus later spread to the villages of Dandou Pombo and Dawa, both in Guéckédou, by the midwife who attended the boy. From Dawa village the virus spread to Guéckédou Baladou District and Guéckédou Farako District, and on to Macenta and Kissidougou.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1971 a Soviet {{medical team}} {{secretly}} {{traveled to the}} crash site and exhumed the bodies, which were by then modestly decomposed. The team removed the heads {{of two of the}} corpses suspected to be Lin Biao and Ye Qun and took them back to Russia for forensic examination. In 1972 the team concluded that the heads belonged to Lin Biao and Ye Qun (the heads are still stored in Russian archives). In order to corroborate their findings the team returned to Mongolia a second time to inspect the body believed to be Lin Biao's. After exhuming the body a second time the team found that the corpse's right lung had the remains of tuberculosis, which Lin had suffered from, confirming the Soviet identification. The Soviet team were not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude. Judging from the fires that burnt after the plane crashed, the Soviets estimated that it had enough fuel to fly to the Soviet cities of Irkutsk or Chita. All of the work and its results were kept secret from the public: outside of the <b>investigative</b> <b>team,</b> only KGB director Yuri Andropov and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev were informed. The report remained classified until the early 1990s, {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E

He also missed that his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked."
