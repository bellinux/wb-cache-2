500|$|In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, {{with whom}} he fell passionately in love, and whom he later married. By 1830, the Heliades' two children, a son named Virgiliu and a {{daughter}} named Virgilia, died in infancy; subsequently, their marriage entered {{a long period of}} crisis, marked by Maria's frequent outbursts of jealousy. Ion Heliade probably had a number of extramarital affairs: a Wallachian Militia officer named Zalic, who became known during the 1840s, is thought by some, including the literary critic George Călinescu, to have been the writer's illegitimate son. Before the death of her first child, Maria Heliade welcomed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>house</b> Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a celebrated writer, whom Ion suspected had become her lover. Consequently, the two authors became bitter rivals: Ion Heliade referred to Alexandrescu as [...] "that ingrate", and, in an 1838 letter to George Bariţ, downplayed his poetry and character (believing that, in one of his fables, Alexandrescu had depicted himself as a nightingale, he commented that, in reality, he was [...] "a piteous rook dressed in foreign feathers"). Despite these household conflicts, Maria Heliade gave birth to five other children, four daughters and one son (Ion, born 1846).|$|E
