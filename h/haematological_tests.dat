A 7 -year-old boy presented with unexplained splenomegaly, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mild learning difficulties, easy bruising, mild thrombocytopenia, and subtle dysmorphic features. Extensive <b>haematological</b> <b>testing</b> including a bone marrow biopsy showed mild megaloblastoid erythropoiesis and borderline fibrosis. There were no haematological cytogenetic anomalies or other haematological pathology to explain the splenomegaly. Metabolic testing and chromosomal microarray were unremarkable. Trio whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a pathogenic de novo heterozygous germline CBL variant (c. 1111 T > C, p. Y 371 H), previously reported to cause CBL syndrome and implicated in development of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). CBL syndrome (more formally known as "Noonan-syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia") has overlapping features to Noonan syndrome with significant variability. CBL syndrome and other RASopathy disorders-including Noonan syndrome, neurofibromatosis 1, and Costello syndrome-are important to recognize as these are associated with a cancer-predisposition. CBL syndrome carries a very high risk for JMML, thus accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance.

40|$|The use {{of simple}} and {{economic}} tests {{to rule out}} diseases of sufficient clinical severity is appealing in emergency department (ED), since it would be effective for contrasting ED overcrowding and decreasing healthcare costs. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic performance of simple and economic <b>haematological</b> <b>testing</b> in a large sample of adult patients presenting at the ED of the Academic Hospital of Parma during the year 2010 with the five most frequent acute pathologies (i. e., acute myocardial infarction, renal colic, pneumonia, trauma and pancreatitis). Both leukocyte count and hemoglobin showed a good diagnostic performance (Area Under the Curve [AUC] of 0. 85 for leukocyte count and 0. 76 for hemoglobin; both p < 0. 01). Although the platelet count was significantly increased in all patients groups except pancreatitis, the diagnostic performance did not achieve statistical significance (AUC 0. 53; p = 0. 07). We also observed an increased RDW in all groups, except in those with trauma and the diagnostic performance was acceptable (AUC 0. 705; p < 0. 01). The mean platelet volume (MPV) was consistently lower in all patients groups and also characterized by an efficient diagnostic performance (AUC 0. 76; p < 0. 01). This evidence led us to design an arbitrary formula, whereby MPV and hemoglobin were multiplied, and further divided by the leukocyte count, obtaining a remarkable AUC (0. 91; p < 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Activated Protein C Resistance (APCR), a poor {{anticoagulant}} {{response of}} APC in haemostasis, is the commonest heritable thrombophilia. Adverse outcomes during pregnancy {{have been linked}} to APCR. This study determined the frequency of APCR, factor V gene known and novel SNPs and adverse outcomes in a group of pregnant women. Methods:Blood samples collected from 907 pregnant women were tested using the CoatestÂ® Classic and Modified functional <b>haematological</b> <b>tests</b> to establish the frequency of APCR. PCR-Restriction Enzyme Analysis (PCR-REA), PCR-DNA probe hybridisation analysis and DNA sequencing were used for molecular screening of known mutations in the factor V gene in subjects determined to have APCR based on the CoatestÂ® Classic and/or Modified functional <b>haematological</b> <b>tests.</b> Glycosylase Mediated Polymorphism Detection (GMPD), a SNP screening technique and DNA sequencing, were used to identify SNPs in the factor V gene of 5 APCR subjects. Results:Sixteen percent of the study group had an APCR phenotype. Factor V Leiden (FVL), FV Cambridge, and haplotype (H) R 2 alleles were identified in this group. Thirty-three SNPs; 9 silent SNPs and 24 missense SNPs, of which 20 SNPs were novel, were identified in the 5 APCR subjects. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were found at a frequency of 35 % in the group with APCR based on Classic CoatestÂ® test only and at 45 % in the group with APCR based on the Modified CoatestÂ® test. Forty-eight percent of subjects with FVL had adverse outcomes while in the group of subjects with no FVL, adverse outcomes occurred at a frequency of 37 %. Conclusions:Known mutations and novel SNPs in the factor V gene were identified in the study cohort determined to have APCR in pregnancy. Further studies are required to investigate the contribution of these novel SNPs to the APCR phenotype.

C. gariepinus fingerlings (mean weight 9. 17 ± 0. 33 g) were randomly distributed into concrete tanks at 10 fish/tank in triplicate treatments and were fed twice daily at 8. 00 hrs to 9. 00 hrs and 17. 00 hrs to 18. 00 hrs for 8 weeks. The haematological parameters results showed that packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell (RBC) and haemoglobin (Hb) were 21. 00 to 32. 00 %, 1. 00 to 3. 60 × 106 mm- 3 and 7. 00 to 920 g/ 100 ml respectively in the fish in the experiment. These parameters decreased as M. oleifera leaf meal increased in the diet in both stages of the experiment. The white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocytes range obtained were 7. 20 to 8. 02 × 103 mm- 3 and 60. 00 to 70. 00 % respectively in the experiment.

Those {{two groups were}} subdivided into 8 subgroups each, based on repeated anaesthesia with sevoflurane, halothane or isoflurane, or i. p. injection of cisplatine. Cells were collected and analyzed by comet test, micronucleus test, determination of percent of tumour cells in apoptosis and necrosis, by counting alive and dead tumour cells in peritoneal fluid and by <b>haematological</b> and biochemical <b>tests</b> from blood of experimental animals. |$|R
40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with acute pancreatitis were studied prospectively {{in the first}} week of their admission using <b>haematological</b> and coagulation <b>tests.</b> Platelet counts initially fell and later returned to admission levels. Rising levels of plasma fibrinogen were recorded. The kaolin cephalin clotting time was shorter than its control in twenty-one patients. Eighteen patients had elevated fibrinogen degradation products and fourteen had a positive ethanol gelation test. It is suggested that by taking into account the results in series of individual patients a degree of intravascular coagulation may be a common feature of acute pancreatitis. In one patient (presented in detail) strong evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulation was foun...|$|R
40|$|Gastro-intestinal stromal tumours {{are rare}} tumours of the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract. Among non-epithelial tumours of gastro-intestinal tract, gastro-intestinal stromaltumours are the commonest {{but as they}} are not extensively documented, they areunderestimated, poorly understood and inadequately treated for various reasons,particularly at peripheral centres in India(1). The gravity of the problem increasesfurther as these tumours respond poorly to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy andradiation therapy. Here a case of gastro-intestinal stromal tumour is reported. Thepatient was a 72 -year-old female who was admitted for complains of black coloredstool and discomfort in epigastic region. The <b>haematological</b> and biochemical <b>tests</b> showed severe anaemia, raised serumaminotransferase aspartate (AST,SGOT) and mild hypoproteinaemia. Laparatomyrevealed a jejunal tumour which was resected. The routine histopathologicalexamination revealed a spindle cell tumour suggestive of gastro-intestinal stromaltumour -intermediate risk group...|$|R
