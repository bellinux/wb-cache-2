Two instances of <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading due to low tank pressure have been document on KV Bergen in the Norwegian Coast Guard. Results from this study revealed that <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading {{was caused by the}} disruption of the liquid surface layer in the LNG tank initiated by tank sloshing. Research found that when the surface layer between the bulk liquid and vapor in the tank was modified by sloshing the rate of vapor condensation increased faster than the mass flow rate produced by the Pressure Build Up (PBU) circuit inside the Vaporizer. Using the difference between the mass flow rate entering the vapor region and exiting through condensation, the time which a <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading situation occurs was predicted. These conclusions were drawn from different models and calculations which analyzed factors affecting tank pressure. One model calculated the PBU mass flow rate by balancing the change in pressure in each section of the PBU. Another model developed an idealized set of equations for the time required to pressurize the LNG tank. A mixing model was also produced which calculated the lowest fall in tank pressure possible if the liquid in the tank mixed completely with the vapor in the tank. These mixing calculations proved the criteria <b>for</b> <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading can be met if there is enough interaction between the liquid and vapor in the tank. A measurement campaign was carried out to understand how the different sub-components of the LNG system (LNG tank, PBU, Evaporator, and water glycol circuit) behaved during normal operations. The goal of the measurement campaign was to find real values which may be used to predict the conditions leading to <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading. Using a heat balance from the different streams entering and leaving the Vaporizer, the average mass flow rate through the PBU circuit was determined to be 0. 16 kg/s. This vapor mass flow rate is an indication of the PBU s ability to build up the tank pressure. The time required to build up the tank pressure from 295 kPa to 495 kPa was measured to be approximately 18 minutes on MF Korsfjord the morning after bunkering. The calculated and measured results were combined to draw conclusions about the main factors leading to gas engine de-loading. By comparing the idealized and actual amount of time required to pressurize the tank, it was possible to estimate that 66. 2 % of the vapor mass flow from the PBU condensed while the tank was being pressurized. Using the rate of vapor condensation, it was possible to calculate that the thickness of an effective conduction layer, representative of the surface layer, is 1. 71 mm in undisturbed conditions. The thickness of an undisturbed tank was used as a base case to examine how modifying the thickness of the surface layer and area of the vapor liquid interface changes the rate of vapor condensation. In situations where the vapor condensation exceeded the PBU mass flow rate, the difference was used to calculate how quickly the tank pressure fell. This report also includes items for further research which would provide additional understanding of the factors leading to <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading. Included is a detailed description of an experimental rig which may be used to find the relationship between disturbances occurring outside the tank and sloshing happening inside. Different abatement technologies are also discussed to improve the reliability of LNG systems on LNG fueled vessels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOnboard the Norwegian Coast Guard vessel KV Bergen, as well {{as other}} LNG fuelled vessels, there has been reports of a sudden fall in the fuel tank system pressure, {{resulting}} in de-loading of the <b>NG</b> <b>engines.</b> This study examines the factors which caused the LNG tank pressure on KV Bergen to fall, leading to the de-loading of the Natural Gas (<b>NG)</b> <b>engines.</b> One reason <b>for</b> the drop in tank pressure is that external disturbances from rough seas destroy the liquid surface layer, causing an increase in the rate of condensation occurring inside the tank. The rate of heat and mass transferred to the vapor section by the Pressure Build Up (PBU) unit is less than the heat and mass absorbed during the mixing inside the LNG tank. A process is developed to calculate the possible fall in LNG tank pressure caused by complete mixing of the liquid and vapor...|$|R

40|$|The {{economics}} of LNG, CNG, and diesel transit buses are compared. A 200 -bus fleet with existing diesel facilities is analyzed. Incremental (relative to current diesel) capital and operating costs are estimated {{in order to}} compare life-cycle costs of all options. Current (rather than future) costs for equipment such as <b>NG</b> <b>engines</b> are considered. Four LNG fuel supply scenarios are analyzed: onsite liquefaction, regional liquefier, peakshaving LNG, and imported LNG. One CNG bus case assumes that gas storage weight creates no bus range or passenger capacity problems, and another case assumes that extra buses are required. Future diesel buses are assumed to require low-emissions engines and cleaner diesel fuel. NOx emissions reduction credit sales enabled by <b>NG</b> bus <b>engines</b> are considered. ...|$|R
