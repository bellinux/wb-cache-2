40|$|Finance theory {{suggests}} that markets where <b>foreign</b> bond <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> overweight their <b>portfolio</b> relative to the prescribed theoretical benchmark should experience higher international risk sharing. Correspondingly, the cost of debt in such markets should be lower compared to markets facing a lower degree of international risk sharing. We empirically examine this prediction using a panel data set of sovereign bond yield spreads and a measure of suboptimal <b>foreign</b> bond <b>portfolio</b> allocations for 50 emerging and ten developed markets. Consistent with theory, our results show higher levels of foreign bond allocations – relative to the theoretical benchmark – are negatively related {{to the cost of}} debt.

40|$|In Razin, Sadka and Yuen (1998, 1999 a), we {{explored}} the policy {{implications of the}} home-bias in international portfolio investment {{as a result of}} asymmetric information problems in which domestic savers, being 'close' to the domestic market, have an informational advantage over <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors,</b> who are 'far away' from the domestic market. However, FDI is different from <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment, concerning relevant information about domestic firms. Through the stationing of managers from the headquarters of multinational firms in the foreign direct establishments in the destination countries under their control, FDIors can monitor closely the operation of such establishments, thus circumventing these informational problems. Futhermore, FDI investors not only have an informational advantage over <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors,</b> but they are also more informed than domestic savers. Because FDI entails direct control on the acquired domestic firm, which the typical domestic savers with ownership position in the firm do not have. Being 'insiders' the FDIers can 'overcharge' the uninformed domestic savers, the 'outsiders', when multinational subsidiaries shares are traded in the domestic stock market. Anticipating future domestic stock market trade opportunities, in advance, foreign investment becomes excessive. However, unlike the home-bias informational problem, which leads to inadequate <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> capital inflows, but may be correctable by Pigouvian taxes such as tax on non-resident income, tax on interest income and corporate tax (see Razin, Sadka, and Yuen (1998, 1999 a)), excessive FDI flows under the insider-outsider informational problem call for a non-tax corrective policy. First, because they are governed by unobservable variables (such as the productivity level which triggers default, according to the firm contract with its lender). Second, because there exist self- fulfilling expectations equilibria which cannot be efficiently corrected by taxation. The corrective policy tool that is left available is then simply quantity restrictions on FDI. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{attempt to}} answer the {{following}} key questions: What are the revaluation effects and the impacts on the cost of capital, volatility, and correlation with world market returns from stock market liberalization in emerging market countries? These questions have been studied extensively at the market-level, i. e. using country indices, but not at the firm level. In the market-level analysis, there is increasing concern whether the country indices are proper means to answer those questions, for example they may not represent the real holdings of <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> after liberalization. Indeed, <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> are known to prefer investment in large and well-known firms. Hence, the opening of capital markets should have a differential impact across securities depending on foreign investors' demand. In order {{to take into account the}} potentially different impacts caused by foreign investors' demand, we use individual firm data as well as market-level indices. Our analysis is based on the cross-sectional and time-series panel regression method. Our test results using country indices show statistically and economically significant revaluation effects, and increases in the cost of capital. While the stock market volatility increases, its correlation with world market return does not change after stock market liberalization. More important than these market-level findings, we report significantly different impacts of stock market liberalization, based on firm size, which is used as a proxy for foreign investors' demand. Large firms tend to exhibit large revaluation effects, insignificant change in the cost of capital, small increases in volatility, and increases in correlation with the world market from liberalization. Small firms show small revaluation effects, increases in the cost of capital, large increases in volatility and decreases in correlation with world market returns after liberalization. Our results have important implications for international investors seeking to manage their global exposure as well as for policy makers considering capital market liberalization...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an empirical analysis of interactions between FDI flows and domestic investment in capacity. As a {{motivation for the}} empirical analysis, I provide highlights of a new theory of FDI. The theory captures unique feature: hands-on management standards, that enable investors to react in real time to on-going changes in the economic environment, which surrounds investors. Equipped with superior managerial skills, foreign direct investors are able to outbid <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> for the top productivity firms in a domestic specialized industry, {{in which they have}} some comparative advantage in the source country. Consequently, FDI investors make investment in the domestic firm’s capacity, which is both larger in size, and of higher “quality ” (that is, in terms of rates of returns), than domestic <b>investors,</b> or <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors.</b> Gains to the host country from FDI stem from the informational value of FDI, over and above the traditional capital-flow gains. The predictions of the theory are consistent with evidence from panel data: larger FDI coefficients in the domestic investment and output growth regressions relative to the portfolio equity flow and international loan coefficients, reflect a more significant role for FDI in the domestic investment process than other types of capital inflows. Likewise, domestic investment in 1 capacity helps explain the volume of FDI inflows, more significantly than it helps explain either <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> inflows or <b>foreign</b> debt inflows. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of the {{changing}} institutional environment on strategic orientations of Japanese electronics firms during the 1990 s. We examine {{the effects of}} three different types of shareholders on strategic directions of their invested firms. The first one, <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors,</b> characterizes the emerging influence that pressed for change in corporate strategies. The two domestic shareholders, corporate investors and financial institutions, represent the conventional forces for continuity. Between the two domestic forces, though, while corporate investors attempted to maintain status quo, financial institutions have shifted towards market-oriented behaviour of investment. Specifically, we explore: (1) the influence of each type of shareholder on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s diversification strategy and capital commitment; and (2) the moderating effects of firm performance on the relationships between ownership structure and strategic choices. The results suggest that foreign investors prefer the focused product portfolio and conservative capital commitment. They also prefer the reduction of capital investment when the financial performance of their invested firms is poor. Domestic financial institutions are now similarly sensitive to the performance of their invested firms when those firms make strategic investments. By contrast, domestic corporate shareholders remain indifferent to performance, while they aim to maintain relational business ties with invested firms...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{portfolio}} {{theories of}} the home bias are disconnected from corporate finance theories of insider ownership. We merge the two into {{what we call the}} optimal ownership theory of the home bias. The theory has the following components. In countries with poor governance, it is optimal for insiders to own large stakes in corporations and for large shareholders to monitor insiders. <b>Foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> will exhibit a large home bias against such countries because their investment is limited by the shares held by insiders (the "direct effect" of poor governance) and domestic monitoring shareholders ("the indirect effect"). >; Foreigners can also enter as foreign direct investors; if they are from countries with good governance, they have a comparative advantage as insider monitors in countries with poor governance, so that the relative importance of foreign direct investment in total foreign equity investment is negatively related to the quality of governance. Using two datasets, we find strong evidence that the theory can help explain the evolution of the home bias. Using country-level U. S. data, we find that on average the home bias of U. S. investors towards the 46 countries with the largest equity markets did not fall over the past decade, but it decreased the most towards countries in which the ownership by corporate insiders decreased, and the importance of foreign direct investment fell in countries in which ownership by corporate insiders fell. Using firm-level data for Korea, we find evidence of the additional indirect effect of poor governance on portfolio equity investment by foreign investors. Investments, Foreign; Globalization...|$|R

40|$|The authors examine to {{what extent}} {{features}} of the international tax system and indicators of transaction costs affect the required rates of return on emerging stock markets. They show that the capital gains withholding tax levied on <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors</b> increases required pre-tax rates of return. As countries generally do not index their capital gains taxes, it follows that inflation increases {{the capital gains tax}} base, as well as the required rate of return on equity. Dividend withholding taxes instead appear not to increase the required pre-tax equity returns significantly. The differing results for capital gains and dividend taxes reflect the fact that foreign investors generally can receive domestic tax credits only for foreign withholding taxes paid on dividends. The return on equity is part of the issuing firm's cost of capital. So, capital gains withholding taxes imposed on nonresidents increase the cost of capital for domestic firms and discourage physical investment. Private investment levels have tended to be low in developing countries in the 1980 's. The cost of equity finance in developing countries has gained in importance inthe last decade, as these countries'access to international lending capital has been limited during most of the decade. What do these findings imply for the design of tax policy in relation to <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment in developing countries? The existence of foreign tax credits for dividend taxes paid suggest that a country should tax capital gains more lightly than repatriated dividends - as do Greece, Pakistan, Portugal, and Venezuela. Each of these countries has positive-dividend withholding taxes but no capital gains taxes imposed on non-residents. Colombia and India do the exact opposite: they tax capital gains far more heavily than dividends. Despite what appears optimal, the trend in developing countries is toward lower dividend withholding taxes, with little change in the average level of capital gains taxation. It appears desirable for developing countries to index their capital gains taxes to prevent them from being higher than anticipated.

Empirical evidence (from a sample of 9 source countries and 13 host countries over the 1980 s and 1990 s), analyzed in a gravity-equation model, provides support for the theoretical hypotheses. The model also demonstrates that the gains for the host country from FDI (over <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment (FPI)) are reflected in a more efficient size of the stock of domestic capital and its allocation across firms.

40|$|We {{examine how}} <b>foreign</b> and {{domestic}} <b>portfolio</b> <b>investors,</b> both classified into money managers, invest in Japanese firms over the sample period of 1985 – 1998. We propose the agency-familiarity hypothesis to explain investment behavior of these institutional investors {{focusing on the}} two firm-level variables: market capitalization and export ratios. Both types of institutional investors over-invest in familiar firms measured in firm size while each shows opposite preference patterns {{with respect to the}} export ratios. The foreign investors become more export-firm oriented in the second-half sample and the domestic orientation of the domestic institutional investors becomes statistically significant during the same second-half. Because of the location difference of their client investors, the compositions of familiar firms are different between these two types with respect to the firm’s export activities. Home bias at the firm level in terms of the sensitivity to the export ratio is evident for both types of investors, especially, in more recent years, although equity home bias at the country level has been gradually mitigated. Based on these macro- and micro-level results, we conclude that the investment behavior of money managers is more consistent with the agency-familiarity explanation than the information-based explanation regardless of their nationalities.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset, the author {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment on the capital issuance behavior of small listed firms. The author finds that <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment is {{associated with an increased}} probability of small firm security issuance in all nations, regardless of property rights development. Evidence suggests the mechanism by which this occurs is a freeing up of capital in domestic markets when large firms utilize the foreign investment directly. Debt levels in nations where property rights are more developed increase, suggesting that <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment may reach small firms through the banking channel as well as capital markets in these nations.

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> capital flows on stock returns of Brazilian listed firms through a 6 -factors APT model, in which an additional risk factor for <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> capital flows was included. First, an aggregate analysis was conducted. The partial effect of <b>foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> capital flows on the IBOVESPA index&# 8217;s returns was statistically significant and positive. Next, a disaggregate analysis was also implemented, in which portfolios of stocks were sorted by sector of economic activity, level of risk and level of corporate governance. <b>Foreign</b> <b>portfolio</b> capitals caused increases in returns especially for sectors related to commodities, industry and cyclical consumption. For the portfolios sorted by risk (in which the stocks&# 8217; betas were used as a risk parameter for sorting), foreign capitals increased the returns of mid-high and high beta portfolios, but decreased the returns of low and low-mid beta portfolios. For corporate governance portfolios, the firms listed on the Novo Mercado segment (according to BMF&Bovespa criteria) experienced a statistically significant revaluation effect. Overall, {{the results of the}} study provide support to the revaluation effect hypothesis...|$|R
