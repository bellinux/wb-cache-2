Burmese curries use {{only a handful of}} spices (in comparison to Indian ones) and use more garlic and ginger. Dishes are prepared with plenty of oil in the case of curries and soups, and the level of spices and herbs varies depending on the region; Kachin and Shan curries will often use more <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs.</b>|$|E
25|$|In central Europe, eastern Europe, and {{southern}} Europe, {{as well as}} in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green, chopped parsley sprinkled on top. In southern and central Europe, parsley is part of bouquet garni, a bundle of <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs</b> used as an ingredient in stocks, soups, and sauces. Freshly chopped green parsley is used as a topping for soups such as chicken soup, green salads, or salads such as salade Olivier, and on open sandwiches with cold cuts or pâtés.|$|E

25|$|Zucchini has a {{delicate}} flavor and requires {{little more than}} quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs.</b> The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially boil and steam, with the juices concentrated in the final moments of frying when the water has gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles for low-carbohydrate recipes.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Iran, Mâst Chekide is {{a variety}} of kefir yogurt with a {{distinct}} sour taste. It is usually mixed with a pesto-like water and fresh herb purée called delal. Yogurt is a side dish to all Iranian meals. The most popular appetizers are spinach or eggplant borani, Mâst-o-Khiâr with cucumber, spring onions and herbs, and Mâst-Musir with wild shallots. In the summertime, yogurt and ice cubes are mixed together with cucumbers, raisins, salt, pepper and onions and topped with some croutons made of Persian traditional bread {{and served as a}} cold soup. Ashe-Mâst is a warm yogurt soup with <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs,</b> spinach and lentils. Even the leftover water extracted when straining yogurt is cooked to make a sour cream sauce called kashk, which is usually used as a topping on soups and stews.|$|E
25|$|Barolos {{tend to be}} rich, deeply {{concentrated}} full bodied wines with pronounced tannins and acidity. The {{wines are}} almost always lightly colored varying from ruby to garnet in their youth to more brick and orange hues as they age. Like Pinot noir, Barolos are never opaque. Barolos {{have the potential for}} a wide range of complex and exotic aromas with tar and roses being common notes. Other aromas associated with Barolos include camphor, chocolate, dried fruit, damsons, eucalyptus, leather, licorice, mint, mulberries, plum, spice, strawberries, tobacco, white truffles as well as dried and <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs.</b> The tannins of the wine add texture and serve to balance Barolo's moderate to high alcohol levels (Minimum 13% but most often above 15% ABV). Excessive extraction from prolonged maceration periods and oak aging can give the wines an over-extracted bitterness.|$|E
40|$|Humans {{and other}} {{primates}} {{have lost the}} ability to synthesize vitamin C and therefore the only source is diet. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid has labile nature, it is removed or destroyed in specific degree immediately after harvest, but storage and post - harvest processing also contribute to its degradation. The aim of work was to determine the vitamin C content in the herb of selected celery and parsley varieties in dependence on chosen postharvest processing and to compare it with <b>fresh</b> <b>herb.</b> There were chosen five bulb forms varieties of celery (Apium graveolens) - Makara, Ilonaa, Hegy Köi, Talar and Diamant. In case of parsley (Petroselinum crispum) there were evaluated one variety of curly parsley, one variety of herb parsley - Petra, and five varieties of root parsley - Lenka, Eagle, Ginate D´Italia, Titana and Arat. Every variety was harvested in three terms, followed by vitamin C content estimation in <b>fresh</b> <b>herb,</b> after drying and after freezing. The content of vitamin C was estimated by HPLC method by the help of liquid chromatograph with UV detector. There was found the significant difference in content of vitamin C in parsley as well as in celery when comparing the <b>fresh</b> <b>herb</b> with herbs after post - harvest processes - drying (by air circulation in laboratory hall) and freezing. After processing of herbs in both observed species the vitamin C content decreased, in case of freezing it was about 65 % (celery) and 61 % (parsley), after drying about 86 % (celery) and 82 % (parsley) in comparison with <b>fresh</b> <b>herb.</b> The effect of processing played more important role in influencing of vitamin C content than variety in case of both selected species. For using of celery and parsley not only as culinary herb, but as a notable source of ascorbic acid it is the most important <b>fresh</b> <b>herb</b> intake.   Normal 0 21 false false false EN-GB X-NONE X-NONE <!

25|$|Wines {{made from}} Nebbiolo are {{characterized}} by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for aging {{and some of the}} highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can continue to improve in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with aromas of tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, mulberries, spice as well dried and <b>fresh</b> <b>herbs.</b> While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a biodynamic sowing {{calendar}} on the growth (plant height, <b>fresh</b> <b>herb</b> yield, nodes number) and quality (percentage of leaf mass, essential oil content) of three basil species, Ocimum americanum L., Ocimum × hybrida and Ocimum basilicum L., represented by the cultivars ‘Rosso’ and ‘Eco Genovese’, were tested. Statistical analyses showed that the species had greater impact on the observed parameters than either the sowing date or the species and sowing date in combination. The species showed a significant influence on all five tested parameters, while sowing date and interaction of both factors significantly influenced plant height, leaf percentage and essential oil content. The best yield per plant was obtained for O. × hybrida and O. basilicum ‘Eco Genovese’. The lowest species O. × hybrida produced the highest amount of essential oil. »Nodes number« parameter most clearly separated the species, but not the cultivars. Even though O. americanum gave the tallest plants, it did not yield either the highest amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>herb</b> or essential oil.
