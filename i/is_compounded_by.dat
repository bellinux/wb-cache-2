5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E

5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the fact that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
25|$|Often, a {{combination}} of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left {{at room temperature for}} many hours, allowing bacteria to multiply which <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.|$|E
25|$|The Pirahã {{language}} is most notable {{as the subject}} of various controversial claims; for example, that it provides evidence for linguistic relativity. The controversy <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the sheer difficulty of learning the language; the number of linguists with field experience in Pirahã is very small.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} in assigning or removing species rank <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> {{the lack of}} data on behaviour and breeding patterns of the taxa. Similar species are allopatric, {{and there is no}} data on whether the species freely interbreed or not. Data on voice and behaviour is similarly poor.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} veiling of {{the relationship}} between Catholic saints and Orichás <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the fact {{that the vast majority of}} santeros in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, are also Roman Catholics, have been baptized, and often require initiates to be baptized in Roman Catholicism as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of child sexual}} abuse in Africa <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the virgin cleansing myth that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure a man of HIV or AIDS. The myth is prevalent in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Nigeria and is being blamed for the high rate of sexual abuse against young children.|$|E
25|$|The {{short supply}} of Mark 14 torpedoes <b>was</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a 10 December 1941 Japanese air raid on Cavite Navy Yard. The attack {{destroyed}} 233 Mark 14 torpedoes.|$|R

25|$|There {{are plans}} by the Penang state {{government}} {{to bring in}} more rail-based transportation systems throughout Penang. The Penang Transport Master Plan envisages the following long-term solutions to counter the state's worsening traffic congestion, which <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> Penang's abnormally high vehicle ownership rate and the state's limited space for urban development.|$|E
25|$|Mass extinctions {{are thought}} to result when a {{long-term}} stress <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> a short term shock. Over {{the course of the}} Phanerozoic, individual taxa appear to be less likely to become extinct at any time, which may reflect more robust food webs as well as less extinction-prone species and other factors such as continental distribution.|$|E
25|$|The city of Sun Prairie {{encounters}} occasional flooding {{because of}} the presence of hydric soils, spring melting and its proximity to the Koshkonong Creek. This condition <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> storm water runoff from development and urbanization in the upper reaches of the watershed. Many residents of the city believe that the problems with flooding are worsening, becoming more frequent over the last 14 years.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{transplant}} recipients in China {{are generally}} not told {{the identity of the}} organ donor, nor are they provided with evidence of written consent. In some cases even the identity of the medical staff and surgeons may be withheld from patients. The problem of transparency <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the lack of any ethical guidelines for the transplant profession or system of discipline for surgeons who violate ethical standards.|$|E
25|$|Fungi {{tend to be}} {{composed}} of soft tissues, making fossilization difficult and the discovery of fungal fossils incredibly rare. This <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the microscopic size and ephemeral nature of ectomycorrhizas and their structure. However, some exquisitely preserved specimens have been discovered in the middle Eocene Princeton Chert of British Columbia. These ectomycorrhizal fossils show clear evidence of a Hartig net, mantle and hyphae, demonstrating well-established EcM associations at least 50 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The grid's {{inherent}} {{high street}} and intersection frequencies produce {{large areas of}} impermeable surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.|$|E

25|$|Introduction {{of exotic}} fauna in Australia by design, {{accident}} and natural processes {{has led to}} a considerable number of invasive, feral and pest species which have flourished and now impact the environment adversely. Introduced organisms affect the environment in a number of ways. Rabbits render land economically useless by eating everything. Red foxes affect local endemic fauna by predation while the cane toad poisons the predators by being eaten. The invasive species include birds (Indian mynah) and fish (common carp), insects (red imported fire ant) and molluscs (Asian mussel). The problem <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> invasive exotic flora as well as introduced diseases, fungi and parasites.|$|E
25|$|The horn fly, as can {{be gleaned}} from its taxonomic {{designation}} Haematobia irritans, is an irritant to livestock. Beyond this, incessant biting <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> loss of blood, and results in such detrimental effects on host physiology as to include reduction in milk production, efficiency, and rate of gain. If the host is infested {{with a large number}} of flies, the resulting skin irritation and wounds may result in the drawing of a secondary infestation of myasis producing flies. There is some controversy over whether the horn fly is a disease vector, with at least one source asserting that the flies can be an intermediate host of Stephanofilaria stilesi, a parasite of cattle in North America.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Alberta, oil {{development}} activities bring {{an enormous number}} of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of muskeg. With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. Woodland Caribou are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during {{the time of year when}} their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.|$|E
