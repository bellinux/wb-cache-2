5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 1898, Augustus Moore Herring {{took one}} of his gliders, fitted with a motor, to Silver Beach in St. Joseph. Herring’s machine lifted <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> {{off the ground and}} {{actually}} flew for seven seconds. Eleven days later, the inventor made another flight of ten seconds. While Herring had a powered heavier-than-air craft, {{he did not have a}} way to control it. It was left to the Wright brothers to perfect controlled flight five years later, and give themselves and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a place in history that might have ended up belonging to Herring and St. Joseph.|$|E
25|$|Unusually for a {{football}} club, Rangers have two different official crests. Today the original scroll crest {{appears on the}} club's strips whereas the lion rampant club crest {{is used by the}} media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters RFC overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881–82 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto Ready, which was shortened from Aye Ready (meaning Always Ready in Scots), all surrounded by the team name, Rangers Football Club. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts {{for the start of the}} 1978–79 season.|$|E

500|$|Critics warmly praised Whisky Galore! on its release. The {{reviewer}} C. A. Lejeune, {{writing in}} The Observer, considered it [...] "a film with the French genius in the British manner", while the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought {{the film was}} [...] "put together with... tact and subtlety", and Henry Raynor, in his review for Sight & Sound magazine, called it [...] "one of the best post-war British films". Several critics identified the script as excellent, and the reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought that the main credit for the film {{should be given to}} Mackenzie and MacPhail for the story. Lejeune thought that the story was treated [...] "with the sort of fancy that is half childlike and half agelessly wise: it accepts facts for what they are, and only tilts their representation, <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly,</b> towards the fantastic and the humorous".|$|E
500|$|His biographer Suetonius, {{writing about}} {{a century after}} Augustus' death, {{described}} his appearance as: [...] "...unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, {{that he would have}} several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something... He had clear, bright eyes... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{said that}} [...] "a great season of Lost {{ended with a}} {{suitably}} great finale, which … ended with the … whoa-inducing discovery that Locke was {{the man in the}} casket. [...] Didn't see that coming—and I can't wait to see what this terrific TV series has coming next." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "the episode was dynamic and busy enough as it relied heavily on action-adventure… but the finale wasn't as mind-bending as [...] season's farewell, during which we received the show's first flash-forward." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the triple-length [...] "There's No Place Like Home", but ranked {{it in the middle of}} his list of the season's episodes from best to worst and decided that [...] "'There's No Place Like Home" [...] (both parts) played fair with the audience 100 percent, answered [...] questions … and yet … I feel <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> disappointed by all of this." [...] He also found the special effects [...] "looked much shoddier than usual" [...] and praised the score. [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press thought that [...] "it might be the most rewarding, deliciously challenging episode in the history of this mystical ABC serial." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "Part 2" [...] "was perhaps the most action-packed, meaningful episode of television I've watched all year. [...] The pace was excellent, and the revelations were plentiful." [...] Compora also wrote that [...] "though the pace was considerably slower, the finale delivered in a big way … it was [...] well written and well directed in its own right." ...|$|E

500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing. But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world".|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, George W. Moore of the USGS and R. C. Bostrom {{presented}} {{evidence for}} a general westward drift of the Earth's lithosphere {{with respect to the}} mantle. He concluded that tidal forces (the tidal lag or [...] "friction") caused by the Earth's rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon are a driving force for plate tectonics. As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, the moon's gravity <b>ever</b> <b>so</b> <b>slightly</b> pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward, just as proposed by Alfred Wegener (see above). In a more recent 2006 study, scientists reviewed and advocated these earlier proposed ideas. It has also been suggested recently in [...] that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics, as Venus has no moon and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet. In a recent paper, it was suggested that, on the other hand, it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward, and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific Ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces). In the same paper the authors admit, however, that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates. They demonstrated though that the westward drift, seen only for the past 30Ma, is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. The debate is still open.|$|E
