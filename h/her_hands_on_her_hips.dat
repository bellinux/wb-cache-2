2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
60|$|Entering Manston's empty bedroom, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> she indifferently {{cast her}} eyes upon the bed, {{previously}} to dismantling it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom McChesney," [...] said Polly Ann, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and her sunbonnet tilted, [...] "that's {{the longest}} speech you ever made in your life." ...|$|E
60|$|Billie rested <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> {{chin and}} searched the {{darkness}} with thoughtful eyes.|$|R
60|$|Lucy laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sister's arm, {{and looked}} up imploringly in her face.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. Gwen {{went forward}} and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's knee.|$|R
6000|$|She pointed {{dramatically}} at the door, but {{the woman}} retained her position, only moving to cuff the boy, who was kicking Henderson on his shins. Then, setting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> she said defiantly: ...|$|E
60|$|Bostil's sister came in {{from the}} kitchen. She was a huge person with a severe yet motherly face. She had <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and she cast a rather disapproving glance at father and daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "He came {{in about}} five minutes ago," [...] said the furmity woman, joining the rest with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> [...] "And then 'a stepped back, and then 'a looked in again. I'm not a penny the better for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{rose from}} her seat to leave also, but Mysa put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} apron, {{replaced}} the cigarette, and, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> plump knees, eyes him steadily.|$|R
60|$|There she paused, {{and crossed}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap, {{and waited for}} {{what was to come}} next.|$|R
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|E
60|$|I {{enjoyed it}} so little, indeed, that I fell to poking the sitting-room fire {{when she entered}} with the Mercury; and read the Mercury assiduously while she brought in breakfast. She set down the tray with a slam and stood beside it, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> her whole {{attitude}} breathing challenge.|$|E
60|$|When he thus spoke we were come {{opposite}} a small, rude dwelling situate in {{one corner}} of a pasture wherein even a sheep would have found it difficult to satisfy its hunger, and in the door of this building stood a motherly looking old woman, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and her eyes fixed on us in curiosity, as I fancied.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped on}} the seat, and wrung <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap. Her downcast eyes still obstinately avoided meeting mine.|$|R
60|$|LADY. Oh, horribly afraid, agonizingly afraid. (She presses <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart.) It hurts only {{to imagine}} it.|$|R
60|$|A slim {{woman of}} fifty, with hollow {{eyes and a}} patient smile, came in, wiping <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> apron.|$|R
6000|$|The {{woman with}} the coffee-pot here faced about, stood up, and, either from design or some odd coincidence, fell into the same dogged {{attitude}} {{that her husband had}} previously taken, except that she rested <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> She was prematurely aged, like many of her class, and her black, snake-like locks, twisting loose from her comb as she lifted her head, showed threads of white against the firelight. Then with slow and implacable deliberation she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{waitress}} {{was instantly}} back with soup, {{and a collection}} of china gathered by a man of much travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha. She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve, brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> and addressed Claire: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the most}} terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been {{accustomed}} of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, {{who worked in the}} yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his step-daughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.|$|E
60|$|After which valediction {{she slowly}} climbed the stairs, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee at each step, with the effort.|$|R
50|$|Underwood {{has stated}} that her {{favorite}} part of the video is when the old woman puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband's.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, don't,' entreated Picotee, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> entertainer's arm. 'It seems wrong; it is {{no concern}} of ours.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the object}} of all this eloquence {{was the cause of}} the first and only quarrel between the gentle {{schoolmaster}} and his spouse; for the learned man had dug out of one of his old books the name of Amyntas, and Amyntas he vowed should be the name of his son; so with that trisyllable he finished every stanza of his ode. His wife threw her head back, and, putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips,</b> stood with arms akimbo; she said that never in all her born days had she heard of anyone being called by such a name, which was more fit for a heathen idol than for a plain, straightforward member of the church by law established. In its stead she suggested that the boy be called Peter, after his father, or John, after hers. The gentle schoolmaster was in the habit of giving way to his wife in all things, and it may be surmised that this was the reason why the pair had lived in happiest concord; but now he was firm! He said it was impossible to call the boy by any other name than Amyntas.|$|E
6000|$|The woman {{snatched}} it angrily. 'I was foolish,' said she. 'Who is thy {{woman in the}} Plains? Fair or black? I was fair once. Laughest thou? Once, long ago, if thou canst believe, a Sahib looked on me with favour. Once, long ago, I wore European clothes at the Mission-house yonder.' She pointed towards Kotgarh. 'Once, long ago. I was Ker-lis-ti-an and spoke English--as the Sahibs speak it. Yes. My Sahib said he would return and wed me--yes, wed me. He went away--I had nursed {{him when he was}} sick--but he never returned. Then I saw that the Gods of the Kerlistians lied, and I went back to my own people ... I have never set eyes on a Sahib since. (Do not laugh at me. The fit is past, little priestling.) Thy face and thy walk and thy fashion of speech put me in mind of my Sahib, though thou art only a wandering mendicant to whom I give a dole. Curse me? Thou canst neither curse nor bless!' She set <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> and laughed bitterly. 'Thy Gods are lies; thy works are lies; thy words are lies. There are no Gods under all the Heavens. I know it ... But for awhile I thought it was my Sahib come back, and he was my God. Yes, once I made music on a pianno in the Mission-house at Kotgarh. Now I give alms to priests who are heatthen.' She wound up with the English word, and tied the mouth of the brimming bag.|$|E
5000|$|The series portrays Darna as a {{more modern}} version of the {{original}} comic icon; prone to overconfidence and heroic jaunty poses (<b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips)</b> ...|$|E
60|$|The girl {{shook her}} head and clapped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mouth more vigorously than before, but the boy went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Luis, those 'passing and truant inclinations.' None such"--pressing both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own heart--"have {{ever found}} a place here!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} face her; I had known so many {{who did not}} recover. She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's shoulder.|$|R
50|$|Parallel Lines {{took its}} name from an unused track written by Harry, the lyrics of which were {{included}} in the first vinyl edition of the album. The cover sleeve image was photographed by Edo Bertoglio and was chosen by Blondie's manager, Peter Leeds, despite being rejected by the band. The photo shows the band posing in matching dress suits and smiling broadly in contrast to Harry who poses defiantly with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> while wearing a white dress and high heels.|$|E
50|$|Game play {{begins with}} a single whistle blown, at which point all skaters begin to skate around the track. The first jammer {{to break through the}} pack becomes the Lead Jammer and is able to call off the jam at any time by placing <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips</b> (although in Renegade bouts, this {{strategy}} is rarely used). In the Renegade game, 3 points are awarded each time the jammer laps the pack (as opposed to regular roller derby where a single point is gained per skater passed). Game play includes WFTDA-outlawed moves such as tripping, slide tackles and all manners of upper and lower body checks. Bouts are known for being brutal and fight-filled.|$|E
50|$|All five cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding her waist, {{looking away from}} the camera in a fluorescent coloured latex dress. The CD and music video DVD format has Hamasaki looking towards the camera with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>hips.</b> The double album format has Hamasaki looking towards the camera with her hands around her waist. The USB format features a long shot of Hamasaki sitting on a TV, looking towards the ceiling. The digital release uses the double album format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Tomokazu Suzuki, and the design was based on modern technology. The album title was superimposed on several TV screens throughout the booklet and the covers.|$|E
60|$|Miss Pinnegar wept {{herself into}} silence. She looked huddled and forlorn. Alvina went to <b>her</b> and laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Merton!" [...] {{repeated}} Grace, pressing both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> temples--"who is she? I do {{not remember}} anybody of that name?" ...|$|R
