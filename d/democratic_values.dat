He trained units, and helped establish a school for officers at the University of Pennsylvania. In an article in the Infantry Journal, he called for a large, national, conscript army similar to those of European countries, arguing that this would be in accord with America's <b>democratic</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E

To fully grasp the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of recent public sphere movements, we should approach them from an agonistic perspective. Once democratic politics is viewed from an agonistic perspective, it becomes possible to recognize that while expressing their critique of existing liberal democratic institutions, the recent public sphere movements contested the dominant understanding of democracy and staged an alternative vision of democracy, democratic culture, and new forms of citizenship...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} found that {{political}} online debates do not to live up to deliberative standards of discussion. Even so, these debates may have <b>democratic</b> <b>value.</b> In the present article, the analytic focus is extended from deliberative democratic theory alone to a broader framework of analysis, which also includes a competitive and a participatory democratic ideal. An analytical framework for identifying democratic elements in online debates, based on these three ideals, is developed, and a sample of postings from two Norwegian newspaper-hosted online forums is explored using this new analytical framework. The analysis shows that the online debates are not particularly deliberative, but that they show ample traces of a participatory and a competitive democratic ideal, indicating that the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of these online forums does not primarily lie in fostering deliberation, but rather in clarifying and contrasting different alternatives, and in providing a training ground for political debates.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of user-generated comments on the Facebook profiles of three Spanish candidates during the Spanish General Election campaign of 2011 through a content analysis that operationalizes deliberative democracy. The findings show that these online spaces do not meet deliberative standards, but that they still serve democratic functions, such as citizen self-expression, democratic socialization and reinforcement of social cohesion among party activists and sympathizers. Moreover, results indicate that <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> might {{vary depending on the}} size of the party where talk takes place. Political conversation on the walls of hegemonic candidates who belong to big consolidated political parties is mostly oriented towards self-expression and features some ideological diversity, so that individuals are sporadically confronted with diversity. For its part, talk on the Facebook profile of the minor candidate lacks fundamental disagreement but includes more in-group interaction, allowing minority ideological spheres for the cultivation of social cohesion and the construction of collective narratives in favorable discursive conditions...|$|R
40|$|Political science {{literature}} often {{claims that}} the participation of civil society organisations increases the democratic quality of policy-making in international governance arrangements. However, it remains unclear under what conditions such a <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> can be achieved and how the empirical reality of this participation relates to the alleged democracy-enhancing quality. In recent years, the European initiatives to establish a civil dialogue, to improve the consultation with civil society organisations and above all the White Paper on European Governance have triggered some scientific expectations that the EU seeks to establish a participatory regime which possibly improves the democratic character of EU policy-making. The central hypothesis put forward in this paper is that the participation of civil society organisations is only then of <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> if it takes place {{in an environment of}} clear rules; thus, an argument is made for a regulated model of participation which is both normatively meaningful and practically feasible. The safeguarding functions of legally enforceable rights to participation ensure democratic instead of lobbying-like participation. Based on normative theoretical reflections on the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of participation of civil society organisations as well as on empirical research in the fields of environmental policy (chemicals, REACH) and migration policy (family reunification), this paper argues that the EU has not yet established an approach to participation that increases the democratic quality of EU policy-making but that it rather follows a voluntaristic and instrumental approach. Nevertheless, some developments in the environmental area give reason for cautious optimism that the EU might move towards a more democratic participatory regime of policy-making. civil society; democracy; European public space; governance...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a hybrid}} {{portraiture}} interpretivist case study methodology, this study explores {{the development of}} <b>democratic</b> educational <b>values</b> of pre-service teachers who participated in a “nested” service-learning practicum during their first semester in a secondary teacher preparation program. In this nested model, both the pre-service teachers and the middle school students with whom they worked participated in service-learning. The study {{is in response to}} the findings of previous researchers that <b>democratic</b> educational <b>values</b> have, in many classrooms, been pushed aside by the pressures of the standardization and accountability movement and by the belief that <b>democratic</b> educational <b>values</b> are critical to a public educational system which supports civic identity and participation. Data collected over the course of one semester included reflective journals, blog postings, observations of the service-learning seminar, observations of teaching practices in the field, and audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Four participants were interviewed three times each, and all four participants were observed both in the service-learning seminar and in their field placements. While this study did not find that participation in a nested service-learning model led to pre-service teachers becoming active agents of change, it did find that the nested service-learning experience helped the pre-service teachers to begin to lay a solid foundation in their understanding of basic <b>democratic</b> educational <b>values,</b> in their plans to embrace <b>democratic</b> educational <b>values</b> in their future classrooms, and in their view of themselves as democratic educators...|$|R

40|$|Just how {{important}} are public service media to democratic culture? Stephen Cushion puts forward the convincing argument that, {{for all the}} commercial choice and competition in contemporary news culture, public service media do not only remain distinctive from market-driven media, they contribute to raising the editorial standards of journalism more widely as well. At a time when public service media are under increasing pressure to justify their licence fees, Cushion undertakes {{a comprehensive review of}} studies examining the 'quality' of journalism produced by public and market-driven media around the world. In doing so, some important and timely questions are raised: Do public service media supply editorially distinctive news to market-driven media? Should citizens continue to subsidize news when so much commercial competition and choice is available? Reviewing also the impact news has on people's knowledge, civic participation and levels of trust towards competing media systems, he finds that the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of news {{is more likely to be}} enhanced when it is produced by public rather than market-driven media. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Value</b> of News provides a useful hybrid of theory and practice and helpfully introduces the concept and history of public service broadcasting. It aims to develop and encourage scholarship asking whether public service media are distinctive from market-driven systems, in addition to serving as an invaluable textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Media, Journalism and Communication studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{makes an}} {{argument}} for the <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> of distrust. It begins by analyzing distrust, since distrust is not merely the negation of trust. The account that it develops is based primarily on Martin Luther King Jr. ’s work in Why We Can’t Wait. On this view, distrust is the confident belief that another individual or group of individuals or an institution will not act justly or as justice requires. It is a narrow normative account of distrust, since it concerns a specific normative task. Distinctions between vertical and horizontal distrust, as well as trust and agnostic trust are also discussed. This paper argues that distrust’s <b>democratic</b> <b>value</b> lies {{in its ability to}} secure democracy by protecting political minorities from having their voices ignored. As such, distrust {{can be viewed as a}} kind of Madisonian “check and balance” that works to prevent tyranny. Distrust also works to secure democracy by forging new or alternative forms of democratic participation. The main example discussed in this paper is King’s involvement in the Birmingham Campaign during the Black Civil Rights movement in America. In this case, King and his supporters’ distrust of fellow White citizens and political institutions led to alternative forms of political expression such as non-violent protests, boycotts, and other forms of civil disobedience, all of which led to greater racial justice by working to alleviate White tyranny...|$|R
