5|$|Our {{understanding}} of herbivory in <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; {{the observation of}} plant debris in fossilised animal faeces; {{and the construction of}} herbivore mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{grown as}} {{industrial}} crops {{are the source}} {{of a wide range of}} products used in manufacturing, sometimes so intensively as to risk harm to the environment. Nonfood products include essential oils, natural dyes, pigments, waxes, resins, tannins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, paint, varnish, turpentine, rubber, latex, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, and gums. Renewable fuels from plants include firewood, peat and other biofuels. The fossil fuels coal, petroleum and natural gas are derived from the remains of aquatic organisms including phytoplankton in <b>geological</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geo{{magnetic poles}} leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Peter Dodson, {{examining}} {{why there}} should be so many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within such a short <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> frame and small area, published {{the results of a}} morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes. For Lambeosaurus, he found that L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the nasal bone with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is far enough away and has had sufficient time to evolve endemic species. The high degree of endemism is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland. A link with Gondwanaland is indicated by the presence of endemic species like the wedding lily (Dietes robinsoniana) whose only living relatives occur in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|In {{the eastern}} Westerwald (the part lying in Hesse) are found {{interesting}} limestone deposits {{from the most}} varied of <b>geological</b> <b>times.</b> Erdbach limestone from the Lower Carboniferous gave one small time period the name “Erdbachian”.|$|R
5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of <b>geological</b> <b>time,</b> was identified by a thin stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Giraffidae {{first appeared in}} the Early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including Canthumeryx, Giraffokeryx, Palaeotragus and Samotherium. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium split into Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, another author J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of Palaeotragus. The okapi is sometimes referred to {{as an example of a}} living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium).|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are seen}} on Earth {{because of a}} fortuitous {{combination}} of circumstances. Even on Earth, the diversity of eclipses familiar to people today is a temporary (on a <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> scale) phenomenon. Hundreds {{of millions of years}} in the past, the Moon was closer to the Earth and therefore apparently larger, so every solar eclipse was total and there were no annular eclipses. Due to tidal acceleration, the orbit of the Moon around the Earth becomes approximately 3.8cm more distant each year. Millions of years in the future, the Moon will be too far away to fully occlude the Sun, and no total eclipses will occur. In the same timeframe, the Sun may become brighter, making it appear larger in size. Estimates of the when the moon will be unable to occlude the entire sun when viewed from the Earth range between 1.4 billion and 650 million years in the future.|$|E
50|$|The region {{constituted}} by the Serra da Pescaria {{and by the}} Bouro mountain constituted, in <b>geological</b> <b>times,</b> a single island. When it was divided it {{gave rise to the}} bay of São Martinho do Porto.|$|R
50|$|The rocks seen at Maes Down {{were laid}} down about 190 million years ago, during the Upper Pliensbachian and Lower Toarcian Stages of the Jurassic Period of <b>geological</b> <b>times,</b> when {{this part of}} Britain lay beneath the sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of marine terraces {{is controlled by}} changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent <b>geological</b> <b>times.</b> Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth’s crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} magmatic {{features}} {{are present in}} the Circum-Superior Belt, including dikes, sills and volcanics that comprise geologic formations. This geologic belt {{is considered to be a}} large igneous province because its magmatic rocks were emplaced over an extremely short <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> span. Even though the Circum-Superior Belt was emplaced during an extremely short <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> span, the associated magmas were probably derived from a number of separate sources.|$|E

50|$|The loch is a {{very recent}} {{creation}} of <b>geological</b> <b>times,</b> forming naturally in a massive storm in 1720. The lagoon, where the loch is now, its small harbour Starny Keppie and the village of Rattray, were {{cut off from the}} sea and engulfed by shifting sands.|$|R
50|$|The Euparagiinae {{are a small}} {{subfamily}} of rare wasps in {{the family}} Vespidae containing the single genus Euparagia.

50|$|The {{mountains}} {{themselves are}} Permian landforms covered and preserved by river-borne sediments in the Permian and partially excavated only in recent <b>geological</b> <b>times.</b> Exposure of these fossil mountains is greatest towards the southeast; {{much of the}} western part of the Permian range remains buried under sandstones and shales.|$|R
25|$|Radiogenic isotope tracers {{are most}} {{powerful}} when used {{together with other}} tracers: The more tracers used, the more control on mixing processes. An example of this application is {{to the evolution of}} the Earth's crust and Earth's mantle through <b>geological</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{planetary}} surface undergoes reshaping over <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> periods due to {{the effects}} of tectonics and erosion. The surface features built up or deformed through plate tectonics are subject to steady weathering from precipitation, thermal cycles, and chemical effects.

60|$|In {{geological}} structure Borneo {{is thoroughly}} continental, possessing formations of all ages, with basalt and crystalline rocks, but no recent volcanoes. It possesses vast beds of coal of Tertiary age; and these, {{no less than}} the great extent of alluvial deposits in its valleys, indicate great changes of level in recent <b>geological</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Here {{also comes}} in that general [...] "parallelism between {{the order of}} {{succession}} of animals and plants in <b>geological</b> <b>times,</b> and the gradation among their living representatives" [...] from low to highly organized, from simple and general to complex and specialized forms; also [...] "the parallelism between the order of succession of animals in <b>geological</b> <b>times</b> and the changes their living representatives undergo during their embryological growth," [...] {{as if the world}} were one prolonged gestation. Modern science has much insisted on this parallelism, and to a certain extent is allowed to have made it out. All these things, which conspire to prove that the ancient and the recent forms of life [...] "are somehow intimately connected together in one grand system," [...] equally conspire to suggest that the connection is one similar or analogous to generation. Surely no naturalist can be blamed for entering somewhat confidently upon a field of speculative inquiry which here opens so invitingly; nor need former premature endeavors and failures utterly dishearten him.|$|R
50|$|All these ranges {{decrease}} in altitude from west to east. In the depressions that border the Pe-shan swelling on {{north and south}} are found the sedimentary deposits of the Tertiary sea of the Han-hai, but no traces of those deposits have been found on the swelling itself at altitudes of 5600 to 5700 ft. Hence, Futterer infers, in recent <b>geological</b> <b>times</b> no large sea has occupied {{the central part of}} the Gobi.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists {{assumed that the}} Earth's major {{features}} were fixed, and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges {{could be explained by}} vertical crustal movement, described in what is called the geosynclinal theory. Generally, this was placed {{in the context of a}} contracting planet Earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short <b>geological</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Falkland Islands {{are located}} in the South Atlantic Ocean between 51°S and 53°S on a {{projection}} of the Patagonian Shelf, part of the South American continental shelf. In ancient <b>geological</b> <b>time</b> this shelf was part of Gondwana, and around 400 million years ago split from what is now Africa and drifted westwards from it. Today the islands are subjected to the Roaring Forties, winds that shape both their geography and climate.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even after}} {{accounting}} for sampling bias, there {{does appear to}} be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic. This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in <b>geological</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most Sason {{species are}} endemic to rather small areas. Two factors are {{believed}} to have contributed to the distribution pattern of Sason. For one, some are found on small islands that emerged from the ocean floor in recent <b>geological</b> <b>times,</b> without ever having been connected to the mainland. These were likely inhabited by pregnant females surviving in floating logs. However, most of the speciation is believed to have occurred due to fragmentation of the former supercontinent Gondwana.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A 3 D basin {{model of}} the Paris basin is {{presented}} in order to simulate through <b>geological</b> <b>times</b> fluid, heat and solute fluxes. This study emphasizes: i) the contribution of basin models to the quantitative hydrodynamic understanding of behaviour of the basin over <b>geological</b> <b>times</b> and ii) the additional use of AGCM to provide palaeo-climatic boundaries for a coupled flow and mass transfer modelling, constrained by geochemical and isotopic tracers. We show the importance of topography {{at the beginning of}} Tertiary to explain high salinities in the Keuper reservoirs {{and the role of the}} Bray fault for the Dogger salinity evolution. An extended stratigraphic data base is used to test the possibility of reproducing the hydrogeologic heterogeneity for only three layers (Dogger/Callovo-Oxfordian/Lusitanian). This allows us to propose a satisfactory representation of the permeability field heterogeneity at the regional scale. As a perspective we present climate simulations for the present, the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and the middle Pliocene (3 Ma). The results indicate that a significant variation in climate variables occurred and hence illustrate the evolution of hydrogeological boundary conditions. These results will be used as input in a 3 D groundwater {{model of the}} Paris basin. ...|$|R
