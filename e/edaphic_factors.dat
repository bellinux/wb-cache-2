Analysis of pdf regularities gives clear and stable information about difference of soil properties in the soil volumes in space in soil horizons under agricultural impacts.

40|$|Although {{speciation}} {{has been}} a central focus in evolutionary biology {{for more than a}} century, there are very few case studies where we have a good understanding of the exact forces that may have acted in the diversification of a group of organisms. In order to examine such forces, botanists have often focused on closely related plants that are found under contrasting soil conditions. The study of such edaphically differentiated plants has provided valuable insight to the role of natural selection in evolution. This paper discusses several key studies that have appeared in the literature in the last half century emphasizing the role unusual soil conditions—such as those found on serpentinite out-crops, mine tailings, guano deposits, and salt flats—can play in the diversification of plant species. Many of these studies have not only shown adaptive differentiation in response to various edaphic features, but have also attempted to examine the link between adaptive traits and traits that are directly responsible for reproductive isolation between the divergent taxa. With the advent of novel genetic techniques and an increased understanding of the genetic architecture of various adaptive traits dealing with substrate tolerance, it will soon be possible to demonstrate the central role of the <b>edaphic</b> <b>factor</b> in plant evolution...|$|R

Significant differences in DGGE profile between below ground bulk vs rhizospheric community profile {{associated with the}} plant was identified. Tagged 16 S amplicon sequencing from PTSO (3912 m) to Bum La (4509 m), revealed that soil pH, total nitrogen (TN), organic matter (OM) significantly influenced the underlying bacterial community structure at different altitudes. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria was inversely related to pH, as opposed to TN which was positively correlated to Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria abundance. TN was also the significant predictor for less abundant taxonomic groups Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae. Bum La soil harbored less bacterial diversity compared to other sites at lower altitudes.

Henry Gleason's early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both theoretical ecology and in vegetation management.
