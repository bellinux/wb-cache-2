50|$|She {{departed}} Melbourne on 4 May 1866 {{bound for}} London via Cape Horn, {{under the command}} of Captain William H. Loughlin. She was carrying 58 passengers and 25 crew, along with a cargo of wool, skins, 2,576 ounces of gold, and 9 tons of <b>zinc</b> <b>spelter</b> ballast. Included in the passenger list were a number of successful miners from the Australian gold fields.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{changes in}} {{physicochemical}} properties and leachability of indium from mechanically activated <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue by planetary mill were investigated. The {{results showed that}} mechanical activation increased specific surface area, reaction activity of <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue, and decreased its particle size, which had {{a positive effect on}} indium extraction from <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue in hydrochloric acid solution. Kinetics of indium leaching from unmilled and activated <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue were also investigated, respectively. It was found that temperature had an obvious effect on indium leaching rate. Two different kinetic models corresponding to reactions which are diffusion controlled, [1 -(1 - x) 1 / 3] 2 =kt and (1 - 2 x/ 3) -(1 -x) 2 / 3 =kt were used to describe the kinetics of indium leaching from unmilled sample and activated sample, respectively. Their activation energies were determined to be 17. 89 kJ/mol (umilled) and 11. 65 kJ/mol (activated) within the temperature range of 30 °C to 90 °C, which is characteristic for a diffusion controlled process. The values of activation energy demonstrated that the leaching reaction of indium became less sensitive to temperature after <b>hard</b> <b>zinc</b> residue mechanically activated by planetary mill...|$|R
25|$|The {{materials}} used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and <b>zinc</b> (<b>spelter).</b> But {{a vast number of}} other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.|$|R
50|$|In 1842 William Crockford, of London {{gambling}} club fame, {{built the}} Zinc Smelting Works {{on the northern}} side of the coast road adjacent to the gas works. The factory was {{said at the time}} to be the most modern in Britain with its own dedicated railway to the nearby Crockford Wharf. Crockford died in 1844 and his widow Sarah continued running the factory with the assistance of a daughter and two sons - Fanny, Henry and Charles Crockford, the latter of whom patented several <b>zinc</b> <b>speltering</b> inventions. The family also laid a mineral railway from Pantasaph to the factory, converted Parys Mine works into a limestone crushing plant and ran a cement factory at Bryn Celyn. With industrial changes and periodic managerial problems output from the zinc works ceased {{by the turn of the}} century and derelict buildings were largely removed by 1928.|$|R
5000|$|The Wynn Hall Colliery {{was opened}} by William Kenrick (1798-1865), the {{grandson}} of John, and consisted of two pits, the 'Foundry Pit' and the 'Rock Pit'. Both pits were [...] "drowned out" [...] in 1846, severely affecting coal production. The Kenricks also owned a <b>spelter</b> (<b>zinc)</b> works at nearby Copperas.|$|R
40|$|The given {{paper is}} closely {{connected}} {{with the process of}} the manufacturing of ZnO. The purity of the metal zinc has crucial influence on the quality of ZnO. ZnO can be produced by pyrometallurgical combustion of <b>zinc</b> and <b>hard</b> <b>zinc.</b> But this mentioned method of preparation leads {{to the creation of the}} enormous amount of waste including chemical complexes. On the basis of the occurrence of the residual content of other elements, it is possible to make prediction about the material behavior in the metallographic process. The input and finally materials were investi-gated and this investigation was done from the aspect of structural and chemical composition of the materials.

5000|$|In the 16th century {{demand for}} latten (brass) in England {{came from the}} needs of wool-carding, for which brass-wire combs were preferred, and battery pieces (brassware formed by {{hammering}} sheet brass in a battery mill.) The only known method for producing the alloy was by heating copper and calamine together in the cementation process and in 1568 a royal charter was granted to the Society of the Mineral and Battery Works {{to search for the}} mineral and produce brass, to reduce dependence on imported metal from Germany. Factories to exploit the process were established at Isleworth and Rotherhithe. By the late 17th century enough was known of metallic zinc to make brass solder directly by combining copper and <b>spelter</b> (<b>zinc</b> ingots). In 1738 a patent was granted to William Champion, a Bristol brass founder, for the large-scale reduction of calamine to produce spelter.|$|R
50|$|During her career, which spanned over 40 years, Williams was {{primarily}} based in London although {{she spent a}} period of 8 or 9 years in Rome from 1910 and may also have worked in New York for some time. In 1893, whilst still a student at Wimbledon College, some of her work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and she was to continue exhibiting here until 1935. Her work was also shown at the Royal Scottish Academy, the Paris salon, in Rome and in New York. She also had a one man show at the Brook Street Gallery in London in 1935. Williams awards included silver medals at the Welsh National Eisteddfod and the Franco-British exhibition and a bronze Santiago medal. Her private patrons included Queen Alexandra and Queen Margherita of Italy and examples of her work can be seen throughout the United Kingdom including two bronze statuettes in Leeds and one in Liverpool. A typical piece, entitled 'The Queen of Dreams' is held by the Victoria and Albert museum and reflects the influence of Alfred Drury. The piece is made of the <b>zinc</b> alloy, <b>Spelter,</b> which was often used as a cheaper alternative to bronze. The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff holds three pieces, (The Chase, The Stick and Jeanette) whilst further examples {{can be seen in}} the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. In 1926 Williams was commissioned to create a bronze bust of Robert Owen which is on display at the museum dedicated to his life in Newton, Powys.|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles have {{generated}} {{interest in the}} oil industry as potential additives. Many nanoparticles have been shown to improve fuel economy and engine efficiency. However, there are an infinite number of nanoparticle formulations, and to test all these would be impossible. The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model which demonstrates the impact of factors such as size, concentration, and hardness on the performance of nanoparticles as oil additives. The concentrations tested were 0. 01 % and 0. 5 % by mass in PAO 4 base oil. The sizes tested were 5 - 15 nm and 20 - 50 nm. Using four compositions to approximate hardness, a 4 x 2 x 2 DOE matrix generated a predictive model of nanoparticle performance. Nanoparticles can reduce friction and physical wear, in turn improving fuel economy. A high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) was used to obtain friction coefficients and wear scar area, and a mini-traction machine with space layer imaging method (MTMSLIM) was used to observe tribofilm growth. Large, concentrated, and hard nanoparticles demonstrated the best performance as friction modifiers and wear reducers. The <b>hardest,</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide, showed the greatest friction reduction at 74 % below base oil and also exhibited 79 % reduction of wear scar area below base oil as compared to, respectively, 62 % and 35 % for the current industry standard. This project examines a limited set of concentrations and compositions, including alloys, and studies of these trends could better indicate mechanisms. Future study of zinc oxide and elements of comparable hardness are recommended and could provide a class of promising nanoparticle additives. [URL]...|$|R
30|$|NP {{composition}} and its surface chemistry are crucial factors {{in determining the}} affinities and identities of proteins that bind to NPs. Deng and co-workers have studied the binding of human plasma proteins to commercially available metal oxide NPs such as titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, and zinc oxide with the same surface charge [54]. The authors revealed that similar proteins adsorb to titanium and silicon dioxide NPs, whereas significantly different proteins composed the <b>hard</b> corona of <b>zinc</b> oxide NPs. In particular, clusterin, apolipoprotein D, and alpha- 2 -acid glycoprotein were detected in the corona of titanium and silicon dioxide NPs while those were not observed in the corona of zinc oxide. Interestingly, some other proteins like transferrin, Ig heavy chain alpha, and haptoglobin (alpha) only {{were found in the}} corona of zinc oxide NPs alone.|$|R
