The network of Myanma electric power system is used as the reference case. The system network contains 90 buses and 106 brunches. The weak points {{are found in the}} network by using Newton-Raphson method. Bus 16, 17, 85 and 86 have the most weak bus voltages. The medium transmission line between bus 87 and bus 17 is compensated by using MATLAB program software. The transmission line is compensated with shunt reactors, series and shunt capacitors to improve transient and steady-state stability, more <b>economical</b> <b>loading,</b> and minimum voltage dip on load buses and to supply the requisite reactive power to maintain the receiving end voltage at a satisfactory level.

40|$|The growing {{costs of}} fuel and {{operation}} of power generating units warrant improvement of optimization methodologies for economic dispatch (ED) problems. The practical ED problems have non-convex objective functions with equality and inequality constraints that make it much harder to find the global optimum using any mathematical algorithms.

This paper presents a novel approach to determining the feasible optimal solution of the ED problems using the recently developed Firefly Algorithm (FA). Many nonlinear characteristics of power generators, and their operational constraints, such as generation limitations, prohibited operating zones, ramp rate limits, transmission loss, and nonlinear cost functions, were all contemplated for practical operation.

Because going to graduate school adds an <b>economical</b> <b>load</b> upon parents, there is concern that family background will influence undergraduates' options. This paper analyzes the effect of family background on the intent to continue education and on early occupational attainment among undergraduates. The information used in this analysis has been collected from 1, 341 undergraduates in four elite universities located in Beijing and Shandong, from February to March 2003. The main results are as follows: (1) In the elite universities, the desire to go on to domestic graduate schools or study abroad among undergraduates is very high. Undergraduates there are likely to seek employment in foreign-invested enterprises, to seek employment as managers or professionals, and t o seek work in big cities. (2) The desire to continue education or study abroad among undergraduates is greatly influenced by family background.

40|$|Background : Chronic wounds, {{especially}} non-healing types, {{are one of}} {{the most}} common surgical conditions a surgeon comes across. The peculiarity of a chronic wound is that, whatever management you give, they refuse to heal, especially the pressure ulcers or bed sores. Many therapeutic methods are available to effect wound healing such as topical application of insulin, growth factors, negative pressure-assisted wound closure, oxidized regenerated cellulose/collagen, hyaluronic acid conjugated with glycidyl methacrylate or gelatin dressings. A less clinically and economically complicated approach to healing chronic wounds seems necessary. Objectives: To study the efficacy of topical use of insulin in wound healing in following terms:-(1) rate of wound healing; (2) safety evaluation; (3) hospital stay. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study carried out in a tertiary health centre from July 2010 to September 2012 in 50 patients after taking an informed and written consent of the patients having chronic ulcer. All the patients who were satisfying inclusion/exclusion criteria patient were randomized into two groups, Group A and Group B. Each group was again sub-divided into 1 and 2 i. e. sub-group A 1, A 2 and sub-group B 1, B 2. Patients with diabetes were grouped as A 1 and B 1 and non-diabetic patients were grouped as A 2 and B 2. Group A patients were treated with insulin dressings and Group B patient′s ulcers were treated with normal saline dressings. Ulcer size and healing was recorded on weekly basis. Strict glycemic control was maintained in all diabetic patients. Results were compared at complete healing or at the end of 12 weeks which ever was earlier. Results: Our study included both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. There was no significant change in BSL(R) values after use of insulin on wounds. The number of days required for wound healing in Group A patients in both subgroups (A 1 and A 2) was significantly less as compared to Group B (B 1 and B 2). The mean rate of healing of wounds was much faster in Group A as compared to Group B. The hospital stay in Group A patients was significantly less than Group B. Conclusion: The use of topical Insulin strongly suggests accelerated wound healing in chronic ulcer. Topical insulin in chronic ulcer is safe and effective without any systemic side effect. Topical insulin significantly reduces the hospital stay of patients with chronic ulcers. Early return to work decreased <b>economical</b> <b>load...</b>|$|E

Thus selecting {{the most suitable}} system which minimizes the cost per ton and meets production needs {{is one of the}} main concerns of mine design and planning. It is also at times difficult to select the optimum equipment, as there are many possible options and influencing factors in selecting a system. Furthermore, some of these factors can be either quantitative or qualitative. As a result, the use of multi attribute decision making methods can be useful. In this article, the selection of the equipment fleet of Gole Gohar mine was done though four stages. First, feasible technical and operational options were determined. Next, the weights of influential criteria were determined using a hybrid method of fuzzy analytical hierarchical process and analytical network process. Then, the alternative preference rating matrix was calculated using fuzzy TOPSIS method and finally, the hierarchy of alternatives was decided by combining the available weight and ranking matrix. This model considers all affecting parameters simultaneously and facilitates making a reasonable decision about the most appropriate material handling equipment. For the purpose of evaluation in this method, the cost of each equipment fleet was assessed and compared using the traditional method. Results show that the use of the fleet of cable shovel and truck is the most <b>economical</b> <b>loading</b> and hauling system.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{various factors}} that influence the cable selection for delivering wind energy to an electrical network. It also investigates when the thermal and voltage limit become the dominant limiting factor {{in order to obtain}} the correct <b>economical</b> <b>loading</b> range (ELR) and load reach of a cable. In addition, the influence of power factor setting and capacity factor of wind turbines on cable sizing are also presented. To account for the stochastic behavior of wind power and electricity price, time series measurements are employed to evaluate the cost of energy losses in a cable. Procedures are summarized to illustrate the cable selection for a wind energy network. The illustration is performed on a 20 kV wind energy network in Sweden. The results indicate that electricity price, discount rate and wind turbine capacity factor affect the ELR of the cable significantly. On the other hand, when the number of evaluation year is reduced from 40 years to 20 years, the ELR does not vary significantly. Furthermore, in the case of no voltage violation, the cable length does not affect the ELR. Moreover, the power factor setting of wind turbines does not affect ELR, but has a significant influence on the load reach of a cable. For the case network with 28 MW wind installation, 8 % savings are obtained when using the selected economical cables instead of the thinnest cables; 2 % savings are obtained when using the optimal power factor instead of the unity power factor. The cable selection method proposed in this paper can be used by both wind farm designers and network operators to select cables for their wind energy collection grids...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} random wave loading in the ocean environment and hence the probability distribution of the extreme values of their response to wave loading is required for their safe and <b>economical</b> design. Wave <b>loading</b> on slender members of bottom-supported jacket structures is frequently calculated by Morison's equation. Due to nonlinearity of the drag component of Morison wave loading and also due to intermittency of wave loading on members in the splash zone, the response is often non-Gaussian; therefore, simple techniques for derivation of their extreme response probability distributions are not available. To this end, the conventional time simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the extreme values of response. However, this technique suffers from excessive sampling variability and hence {{a large number of}} simulated response extreme values (hundreds of simulated response records) are required to reduce the sampling variability to acceptable levels. In this paper, a more efficient version of the time simulation technique (ETS) is introduced to derive the probability distribution of response extreme values from a much smaller sample of simulated extreme values.

40|$|Although {{contrasting}} {{evidence exists}} in the literature as to the economy of head-loading, there is a notion that head-loading is an extremely <b>economical</b> method of <b>load</b> carriage. This {{has become known as}} the ‘free ride’ hypothesis and, although untested, it is widely accepted. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the ‘free ride’ hypothesis for head-load carriage among African women by comparing the relative economy of head-loading and back-loading. Twenty-four Xhosa women walked on a level treadmill, attempting to carry loads of between 10 % and 70 % of their body mass (BM) using both a backpack and a head basket. All 24 women carried at least 25 % of their BM in both conditions. The relative economy of load carriage was calculated for loads of 10 % to 25 % of BM. Results indicated that the ‘free ride’ was not a generalisable phenomenon, with both methods realising economy scores close to unity (1. 04 ± 0. 19 and 0. 97 ± 0. 15 for head-loading and back-loading, respectively). The results did, however, reveal significant individual differences in economy scores and it is suggested that analysis of such individual differences in future may well be instructive in understanding mechanisms associated with greater economy in load carriage...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceA new residential-level load {{management}} {{system in the}} presence of real-time pricing for future power systems with smart grid technologies and concepts was developed in this work. In {{the first part of this}} research, a new strategy combining demand response (DR) and vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) application was designed. Since DR will inevitably affect a customer's comfort level and the V 2 G application will significantly degrade the life of a vehicle battery, it was hypothesized that the two together could compensate for their individual disadvantages. By reducing peak loading, a customer's comfort level and electric vehicle (EV) battery degradation are considered. Based on the first part of this work, a new control model was developed to reduce load-forecasting errors so that real-time demand would be as close as possible to the forecasting load. Currently, making a forecasted demand equal to a real-time demand is a very challenging task in power systems. Sometimes the unexpected load causes serious problems in power systems. From a technical perspective, overloading could affect the lifespan of infrastructures significantly at the distribution level. From an <b>economical</b> perspective, unexpected <b>load</b> demand could increase the market risks for utility companies, and eventually, the electricity bill of customers could be increased.

Two sample namely CI-PSSDBWPA and CIPSSDBWPB constructed with the dimension of 78 mm thickness x 830 mm length x 1000 mm height. The aspect ratio (h/ 1) and the slenderness ratio (h/t) of both samples are 1. 2 and 12. 82 respectively. The strength of concrete infill inside the PSSDBWPA and PSSDBWPB are 20. 8 N/mm 2 and 32. 5 N/mm 2 respectively determined by Schmidt rebound hammer test. These wall panels are tested under direct axial lone load to monitor structural performance of the wall. It was observed that the final failure modes of the both samples are similar failed under combination of local buckling and crushing. The increment of concrete infill from grade 20 to grade 30 decreased deflection CIPSSDBWP by 43. 33 % but increased 58 % ultimate strength capacity. Generally similar crack patterns were observed in both samples, it was observed that increasing on the strength of concrete infill inside the wall panel also increased the first cracking load and the number of crack but the ratio of first crack load over ultimate load remain close to CI-PSSDBWPA.

To successfully manage to fully liquidate the use of fossil energy and nuclear power, it’s demanded by their successors to keep the same reliability and capacity. Energy storage systems can play a great role in enabling this transition, partially to decrease the losses on the power grid but also to maintain the reliability and increase the flexibility. This study has been conducted with the main focus on load leveling households and substations, but also to locate which applications an energy storage system may have in the future and explain the benefits and disadvantages that rises from it. This study also presents a survey on different kinds of battery technology and the future of batteries. Simulations have been carried out on load leveling with energy storage system in households and substations. The simulations on households have been carried out both with and without power input from solar panels.

Data from four different households in Umeå has been used to act as an average household to conduct <b>economical</b> calculations on <b>load</b> leveling with an energy storage system. The study also presents a theoretical chapter, discussion and examples of optimizing dimensions of an energy storage system with solar panels, the financial aids and the laws and regulations of energy storage systems. The simulations indicate that regardless {{of the size of the}} energy storage system improvements can be made, provided an efficient power control. The improvement found from the simulations are reduced peak-power bought from the grid, and in the real world installing an energy storage system would also mean decreasing electrical losses. The simulations also indicates that the maximal power peaks over the household or substation can be reduced with the maximum output power from the energy storage system, provided an efficient power control. The most important factor in optimizing an energy storage system is considered to be the control of input and output power from the batteries.
