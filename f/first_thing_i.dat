500|$|The Shadows (consisting of {{band members}} Brian Bennett, Hank Marvin, John Rostill and Bruce Welch) as Themselves, {{complementing}} Cliff Richard Jr in Alan Tracy's dream sequence set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet {{that was based}} on his likeness: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did was to ask if I could keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on February 17, 2011, with Entertainment Weekly, Nathan Fillion joked that: [...] "If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> would do is buy the rights to Firefly, make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet". [...] This quickly {{gave rise to a}} fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights. On March 7, 2011, the organizers announced the closure of the project due to lack of endorsement from the creators, with $1 million pledged {{at the time it was}} shut down.|$|E

500|$|For the {{recording}} session, Dylan invited Mike Bloomfield from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that B.B. King stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played {{the way that he}} dug, and he said it was groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake was {{accustomed}} to keeping his own hours; he frequently had difficulty sleeping and often stayed up through the night playing and listening to music, then slept late into the following morning. Recalling {{the events of the}} night, his mother later said: [...] "I never used to disturb him at all. But it was about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time he got up. And he was lying across the bed. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was his long, long legs." [...] There was no suicide note, although a letter addressed to Ryde was found close to his bed.|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment? ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} Enrique explained the reason behind titling {{his new album}} as Sex and Love. He said: [...] "It's one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> thought about when I listened to the whole body of work. I think it's something we can all relate to no matter what religion no matter what personality, no matter what colour we can all relate to it." ...|$|R
500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{likens the}} song to [...] "the R {{equivalent}} of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple {{enough not to}} intimidate beginners. [...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E

500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had to do was to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E
500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film when I was the most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E

500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want you to do is not to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E
500|$|... "Creep" [...] has {{not only}} been covered, {{it has also been}} sampled and recreated by many hip-hop and R artists. Two of the notable ones were {{released}} on SoundCloud in 2013 and gained many attention from the public are Haitian-Canadian record producer Kaytranada's remix of the song called [...] "Kaytranada's Creepier Edition" [...] in January and GoldLink's own rap rendition in December. Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record she loved it! Hopefully the fans will too!," [...] Bellinger said in a statement sent to MTV News. In the track, its new content finds Bellinger making promises to never cheat on his lover. The original [...] "Creep" [...] also made its appearance on The Game's [...] "Sex Skit" [...] from his album The Documentary 2.5, released in October 2015. In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it. And that's kind of what I think made me want to record it. That was literally the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was 'Do do, do,' , and I was like, 'Oh, yes. Yes, please.'," [...] she shared. Watkins had also confirmed to have a cameo on its music video that hasn't yet been released.|$|E
