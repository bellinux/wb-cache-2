Google Scholar makes specific recommendations for repositories, including the use of publishing industry metadata schemas over Dublin Core. This paper aims to test a theory that transforming metadata schemas in institutional repositories will lead to increased indexing by Google Scholar. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted two surveys of institutional and disciplinary repositories across the USA, using different methodologies. They also conducted three pilot projects that transformed the metadata of a subset of papers from USpace, the University of Utah’s institutional repository, and examined the results of Google Scholar’s explicit harvests.

5000|$|In {{the field}} of drug discovery, retrometabolic drug design is a {{strategy}} {{for the design of}} safer drugs using either a soft drug or targeted drug delivery approaches. The phrase retrometabolic drug design was coined by Nicholas Bodor. [...] The method is analogous to retrosynthetic analysis where the synthesis of a target molecule is planned backwards. In retrometabolic drug design, metabolic reaction information of drugs is used to design parent drugs whose metabolism and distribution can be controlled to target and eliminate the drug to increase efficacy and minimize undesirable side effects. The new drugs thus designed achieve selective organ and/or therapeutic site drug targeting and produce safe therapeutic agents and safe environmental chemicals. These approaches represent systematic methodologies that thoroughly integrate structure-activity (SAR) and structure-metabolism (SMR) relationships and are aimed at designing safe, locally active compounds with improved therapeutic <b>index</b> (<b>ratio</b> of benefit vs. side effect).|$|E

Babcock et al. (1993) [...] monitored changes in fecundity and fertility (fertilisation rate) over the spawning season of the Crown-of-thorns starfish on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, from 1990 to 1992. The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to mid-summer) in this region with most observations being in January. However, both gonadosomatic index and fertility peaked early and declined to low levels by late January, indicating that most successful reproductive events took place early in the spawning season. In northern hemisphere coral reefs however, crown-of-thorns populations reproduce in April and May, and were also observed spawning in the Gulf of Thailand in September. High rates of egg fertilisation may be achieved through the behaviour of proximate and synchronised spawning (see above in Behaviour).|$|E

Patients and methods: After excluding criteria, {{the records of}} 220 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) were retrospectively reviewed. Serum samples of PSA, total testosterone (TT) and FT were collected at 8. 00 A. M., one month after biopsies and before RP. The PSA/FT ratio was computed in the population of patients who were clustered in groups according to ranking intervals of the PSA/FT ratio which identified at least 4 clusters which were coded as A, B, C, and D. The independent associations of the PSA/FT <b>index</b> <b>ratio</b> were assessed by statistical methods and a two-sided P < 0. 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results: TT correlated to FT which {{was a significant predictor}} of PSA in the population of patients who were subsequently clustered, according to increasing interval values of the PSA/FT <b>index</b> <b>ratio,</b> in groups that showed a stronger linear association of FT with PSA. The PSA/FT <b>index</b> <b>ratio</b> significantly associated with pathology features of prostate cancer such as pathology Gleason score (pGS), invasion of the seminal vesicles (pT 3 b), proportion of positive cores (P+) and proportion of cancer involving the volume of the prostate. In the population of patients, TT, PSA/FT <b>index</b> <b>ratio</b> and P+ independently associated with pGS ≥ 7 and pT 3 b; moreover, the odds ratio (OR) of the PSA/FT <b>index</b> <b>ratio</b> resulted 9. 11 which was stronger than TT (OR = 1. 11) and P+ (OR = 8. 84).
