The implementation of LBM and LBM-PFC coupling is validated with the analytical solutions {{in a couple of}} hydrodynamics and fluid-particle interaction problems, i. e., the accuracy of LBM as a CFD solver is verified by solving channel flow driven by a pressure gradient for which the closed-form solution is also derived; the accuracy of LBM-PFC coupling is validated by solving flow across a cylinder, Taylor-Couette flow, Kármán vortex street, and fluid flow through a cylinder array. To demonstrate potential applications of this coupling code, a perforation cavity subjected to axial <b>fluid</b> <b>flush</b> is then tested, showing that the collapse and reconstruction of sand arch in the perforation cavity can be reproduced in this coupling system.

This fault (the Schauenburg Fault, near Heidelberg), juxtaposes Permian rhyolite against Carboniferous (Variscan) granite and shows syn- or post-rift {{displacement of the}} north–south trending, eastern boundary fault of the rift basin. Both mineral texture and rock fabric indicate that the fault forms a site of high rock permeability and fluid flow, and records the exhumation and fluid-rock history of the rift shoulder since the Mesozoic.

40|$|Electrokinetic {{extraction}} is {{an emerging}} technology that has shown considerable potential for {{efficient and effective}} removal of both inorganic and organic contaminants from fine-grained soils of low hydraulic conductivity and large specific area when conditions are favorable. The cleanup technology is basically {{the application of a}} direct-current electric field across contaminated soils through electrodes installed in the subsurface. The contaminant is removed by (1) electro-osmotic advection of pore <b>fluid</b> <b>flushing</b> the contaminants; (2) ionic migration or electromigration of contaminants carrying charges; and (3) electrophoresis of charged colloidal-sized particles carrying contaminants. However, many complicated electrochemical phenomena that can change the electrokinetic properties of soil particles and the chemistry of pore fluid occur simultaneously. The resulting soil-chemical interactions may enhance or inhibit the extractability of contaminants by electrokinetics, as various electrochemical processes are dynamic, reversible, and interdependent. The impacts of these phenomena on contaminant extractability by electrokinetics are discussed in this paper.

40|$|Acquiring {{samples from}} the {{subsurface}} of Mars poses many challenges. The scientific return increases with the depth from which the samples are obtained, but so does the risk. Thus, {{it is important to}} develop a fully autonomous drilling platform that will be capable of accessing the required depth and retrieving cores for scientific analysis. The method of drilling most likely to succeed will be a conventional mechanical core drill, either rotary or percussive, with a mechanical system for removing the cuttings and rock core from the hole. Instead of <b>fluid</b> <b>flushing</b> systems for removing cuttings, which {{would be very difficult to}} provide and in addition may contaminate the sample, an auger system is the best solution for rotary drilling. However, no such solution has been identified for the percussive drilling method. To solve this problem, a novel means of conveying cuttings out of the hole during percussive drilling has been developed and is presented in this paper. It relies on the reciprocating action between a pair of surfaces covered with bristles. Experimental results show that there is an optimum ratio of particle diameter to bristle length that gives the highest speed of particle conveyance. This new method also stabilizes the hole so that the drill string may be removed to recover a rock core sample. ...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. High T - low P metamorphic {{rocks in the}} Kanappa Hill area of the eastern Mt. Lofty Ranges preserve evidence for mineral equilibration during crustal thickening at temperatures marginally greater than 600 °C and pressures of 3 - 5 kbars. Field and petrographic observations suggest that the high temperature portion of the P-T-t path experienced by these rocks was near-isobaric, with the implication that the thermal perturbation recorded by these rocks occurred in response to rapid advective heat transfer rather than to purely conductive processes. Estimation of the metamorphic fluid flux from a stable isotope study indicates that pervasive <b>fluid</b> <b>flushing</b> made no {{significant contribution to the}} thermal perturbation. Thermomechanical modelling of the response of the crust to magma emplacement predicts metamorphic conditions which closely match observations from the field, viz: (1) peak metamorphic temperatures reached during convergent orogenesis, (2) near isobaric P-T-t paths immediately before and after attainment of peak metamorphic conditions. Consequently high T - low P metamorphism in the Kanappa Hill Area is considered to have occurred in response to upper crustal emplacement of melts generated by subcrustal heat input. Thesis (B. Sc.

LPA production is mediated by the action of ENPP 2, a secreted lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) that converts lysophosphatidyl-choline to LPA. However, the mechanism that regulates LPA production by ENPP 2 in the porcine uterus is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated ENPP 2 expression during the estrous cycle and pregnancy in the uterine endometrium and in early stage conceptuses. We also evaluated lysoPLD activity in the uterine lumen. ENPP 2 transcripts and proteins were detected in the uterine endometrium at all stages of the estrous cycle and pregnancy, with higher levels on Day (D) 12 and D 15 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. ENPP 2 expression was localized mainly in luminal and glandular epithelial cells in the endometrium and was also detected in conceptuses on D 12 of pregnancy. Secreted ENPP 2 protein was detected in <b>fluid</b> <b>flushing</b> samples from the uterine lumen on D 12 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy, with higher levels on D 12 of pregnancy.

It is composed of 0. 5 % WF-H fiber, 2. 2 % WF-O oxidant, 0. 35 % FeSO 4, 1. 8 % KCl, 3. 0 % swollen powder perlite and water with its density of 1. 03  g/cm 3. This cementation <b>flushing</b> <b>fluid</b> was systematically tested and evaluated in terms of its washing efficiency on the filter cake of water-based drilling fluid and its capacity to improve the bonding strength of cementation interface. In addition, an analysis was performed of its effect on the physical-chemical characteristics and the micro-structures of interfacial cements by means of infrared spectrum (IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDS). It is shown that the new cementation <b>flushing</b> <b>fluid</b> presents excellent washing effect on water-based drilling fluid filter cake (with washing time within 10  min). The cement particles at the cemented interface can be hydrated normally, and hydrated calcium silicate gel, Ca(OH) 2 and rod-shaped ettringite (AFt) crystal are generated and interwoven with each other. In this way, dense network structures are formed, so the bonding strength of the second cementing interface rises significantly, and then cementing quality is improved.

The most important sources of these data are the analyses of groundwater samples collected during extraction tests performed in boreholes either during drilling or after drilling has been completed.
