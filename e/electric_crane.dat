50|$|In 1917, like Pier 1, Pier 2 {{was owned}} by the Northern Pacific Railway, {{although}} {{in the case of}} Pier 2 it was operated by the Alaska Steamship Company. Pier 2 measured 770 by 120 feet, with 1,400 feet of berthing space. Pier 2 had a warehouse measuring 750 by 100 feet, with a cargo capacity of 17,000 tons. Track capacity at Pier 2 was 18 rail cars. Like Pier 1, Pier 2 had adjustable slips. In 1917 Pier 2 had an <b>electric</b> <b>crane,</b> with a capacity 25 tons.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, Henry Royce {{started a}} {{domestic}} electric fittings factory at Cooke Street. He made three cars (the Royce 10) {{in a corner}} of what was his dynamo and <b>electric</b> <b>crane</b> workshops. In 1904, Royce and Charles Stewart Rolls created a business partnership after meeting at Manchester's Midland Hotel and started to build their own motor car (a relatively new invention). Hulme was the location of their first Rolls-Royce workshop, though operations were moved to Derby shortly afterwards. The Silver Ghost was designed and produced in Hulme. The Rolls-Royce V-8 was designed in Hulme in 1905 to compete with the popular electric town cars which were quiet, easy to start and free of smells, smoke and vibration.|$|E
25|$|Andes {{was built}} with five cargo holds. Parts of holds 1, 3 and 5 {{and all of}} holds 2 and 4 were {{insulated}} and refrigerated. <b>Electric</b> <b>cranes</b> served holds 1, 4 and 5; derricks served holds 2 and 3.|$|R

25|$|Titanic was {{equipped}} with eight <b>electric</b> <b>cranes,</b> four <b>electric</b> winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage {{in and out of}} the hold. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{rain on the}} Etheridge {{watershed}} {{washed away}} the Tate and Lynd River railway bridges and the Chillagoe smelters had to close between 19 April and 3 May 1911. Copper smelting only operated for half the year. The copper furnace was remodelled in May 1911 with extra battery jackets replacing the brick shaft. The forehearths of cast iron were also replaced by riveted mild steel. The tanks were lined with chrome bricks. A 42 inch Dwight-Lloyd unit for the palate sintering process was completed by November 1911. However {{a large part of}} the smelter, including an <b>electric</b> <b>crane,</b> was destroyed by fire. The damage was quickly repaired and the smelter recommenced in February 1912.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from a study of flexible reactive power compensation systems up to 100 kvar. Although the issue of reactive power and solutions for its reduction are not new, each case and object needs separate examination. The aim is to evaluate the application of flexible reactive power compensation systems for industrial consumers {{and to develop a}} feasibility comparison of parameters for two fundamentally different high speed reactive power compensation systems. Reactive power compensation of an <b>electric</b> <b>crane</b> drive system in Riga Trade Port was used as a basic object for application. Moreover, this feasibility study of flexible reactive power compensation systems can have other applications where dynamic load compensation is essential...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a marine power plant with {{a battery pack}} has been modeled using bond graph theory, using the bond graph {{simulation}} software 20 -sim. The popularity of hybrid power systems are increasing in the marine sector, mainly {{because it is an}} effective way to reduce fuel consumption, emissions and maintenance costs. Three control strategies were created to test the model, where each strategy had a different focus. A new control strategy were developed after case study one, were each of the control strategies were tested. The new control strategy, which then would be used in case study two, combined two of the previously tested strategies, to gain the benefits of both. In case study 2, which was this thesis main case study, the results of two simulations where compared. One simulation ran two gensets and the other ran one genset assisted by a battery pack. The load profile applied was set to resemble an <b>electric</b> <b>crane</b> operation on a dry bulk carrier. The results show that if one genset is replaced with a 362 kWh battery pack, the fuel consumption rate can be reduced by 9. 23 %, while the maintenance costs for the operation can be reduced by over 50 %. The figures are believed to be conservative, since the battery pack model's efficiency rating is lower than the real battery pack, due to an added resistance to make the model stable. The results shows that implementing a battery pack can give significant reductions both environmentally and economically, and should be implemented on all ships that has a diesel-electric power system...|$|E
50|$|Stothert and Pitt {{supplied}} their earliest <b>electric</b> powered <b>crane</b> to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors {{could be}} placed in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them {{to be placed on}} raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the portal crane. Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic <b>cranes),</b> <b>electric</b> <b>cranes</b> were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a fixed crane, cranes could be brought to each ship's hold hatches as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile <b>electric</b> <b>cranes</b> were near universal.|$|R
5000|$|When built, {{the pier}} {{was divided into}} two halves. The {{southern}} side of the deck was reserved for commercial use, and was fitted out to load and unload cargo from harbour ships, including <b>electric</b> <b>cranes,</b> electrically operated capstans and two railway tracks. The pier was capable of handling one passenger vessel, three cargo vessels and two pleasure steamers simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|In 1892, {{hydraulic}} machinery, including cranes, {{appeared in}} the docks. These used a powerful central power supply and could transfer cargoes more quickly. In 1906 <b>electric</b> <b>cranes</b> appeared too. The steam crane was required less and less often; {{for a whole year}} between April 1905 and April 1906 the crane went unused. From 1903 to 1909 it made a total of 143 lifts. It remained useful for heavy loads, however.|$|R

5000|$|Moore (1812-1877) was an {{engineer}} based in Liverpool. His company, Sampson Moore & Co. specialised in casting large iron structures and ownded North Foundry in Gt Howard Street Liverpool. Sampson Moore & Co. supplied mortars for the Royal Navy and goods were shipped overseas on the 105 ft wooden steamship, the SS James Dennistoun. In 1876 Sampson Moore designed and supplied {{the first ever}} <b>electric</b> overhead <b>crane,</b> which was used to hoist guns at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, London. Specifically he patented the improved winch mechanism that allowed the lifting of heavier weights (such as naval guns) by an electric motor. <b>Electric</b> overhead <b>cranes</b> were subsequently installed in several foundries {{in the north of}} England and were considered one of many technical advancements of the British Industrial Revolution. [...] The invention was celebrated in the Opening Scene of the London 2012 Olympics, where an <b>electric</b> overhead <b>crane</b> lifted cast Olympic rings out of a staged foundry in the Pandemonium scene. Other notable inventions included a machine for rolling tobacco and machines for rolling and polishing rice.|$|R
