The growth of garden type Cyclamen grown under a combination of both overhead irrigation and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown in either wick irrigation, ebb & flow irrigation or overhead irrigation.

The growth of Vinca grown in a combination of overhead irrigation and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown with overhead irrigation alone. The irrigation amount had no effect on the growth of Vinca regardless of irrigation method. The growth of Petunia was greater with increased amounts of irrigation water. However, the growth of Pansy grown under overhead irrigation was significantly greater than that grown in a combination of overhead irrigation and subirrigation. These results suggest that a combination of overhead irrigation and subirrigation method in bedding plant production without polyethylene pots is generally suitable since the plants grow without drought stress.

The effect of medium type was not as significant as the difference in water loss per pot. Water loss per pot of medium without PP was about two times greater than medium held in PP. No compacted medium disintegrated easily without root-ball formation, and in 20 days after cutting about half of non-compacted medium had disintegrated. Compacted medium did not disintegrate before rooting. Medium type did not significantly affect rooting rates, plant heights, leaf numbers and fresh weights when transplanted to medium. Also, cell or pot medium type did not significantly affect plant heights, flower numbers, leaf numbers and fresh weights. Non-compacted medium without PP easily disintegrated with overhead irrigation. Subirrigation and much overhead irrigation had similar effect on growth when planted in containers. However, less overhead irrigation had significantly lower growth. Moreover, in less overhead irrigation, non-compacted medium without PP had remarkably lower growth than compacted medium without PP.

Compacted pot medium was easy to transplant since it did not disintegrate. Therefore, it was considered practical and feasible to use compacted medium without PP for bedding plant production...|$|R
40|$|Drying oils, {{especially}} linseed oil, {{have been}} used since the 15 th century as a painting <b>medium.</b> <b>Hardening</b> of linseed oil is a complex and little understood process involving autoxidation that has frequently led to the spontaneous ignition of rags doused with linseed oils. In the present study, low temperature oxidation of linseed oil and its active components, linoleic, linolenic and oleic acids in 50 mol% 0 ₂ has been investigated in a plug flow reactor, with and without an added cobalt catalyst. Glass wool, silanised glass wool and cotton wool have been impregnated with the drying oils and held in the flow reactor at an initial temperature between 60 and 100 °C. Online analysis of products has been performed by micro gas chromatography. Sampling gas analysis involved μGC, FTIR spectroscopy and GC-MS. Reaction has been monitored {{over a period of}} several hours. An induction period which depends on the substrate and the initial temperature has been observed prior to rapid increase in the evolution of products of oxidation including CO, C 0 ₂ and H₂ 0. The ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide becomes larger as the initial temperature increases suggesting distinct pathways for the evolution of CO and C 0 ₂. FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of aldehydes and carboxylic acids, with identification of these species confirmed by GC-MS. Light hydrocarbons, especially ethane and ethylene were quantified by the micro gas chromatography. Cobalt(II) nitrate catalysed the autoxidation reactions. In the absence of a catalyst, the oil samples were found to undergo a slower hardening process, probably associated with cross-linking or polymerisation together with partial fragmentation to form the observed low molecular weight products...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of aluminium alloys, low weight/strength ratio, their corrosion resistance, weldability and the easy shaping of aluminium into di erent contour {{shapes and sizes}} (extrusion process), enhance the use of aluminium in structural applications. The present dissertation concerns the investigation of {{some aspects of the}} behaviour of welded aluminium double T beams. The investigation was conducted by means of a shell nite element model, taking into account material nonlinearity. Geometrical nonlinearity is neglected. Aluminium alloys develop relatively medium strengths (up to 180 N=mm 2), whereas heat treatment increases their strength substantially (up to 350 N=mm 2). Heat treatments have no a ect in ductility (8 - 10 %), Young Modulus (E= 70000 N=mm 2) and other physical properties. As is well known, aluminium alloys exhibit a nonlinear stress-strain behaviour, characteristic for each aluminium alloy. In the literature, many stress-strain relationships are proposed. In the present work, the thorougly experimentally tested, Ramberg-Osgood law is used. The exponential # ## " law is given by the following expression: " = # E + 0 : 002 # f 0 : 2 !n (E. 1) where E is the Young Modulus of elasticity (E= 70000 N=mm 2, f 0 : 2 conventional yield limit corresponding to a permanent deformation 0 f 0. 2 % and n hardening parameter characteristic for each alloy. Taking into account their varying hardening characteristics, and their mechanical behaviour in the heat a ected zone, three aluminium alloys were selected from table 3. 2 b of Eurocode 9, {{for the purposes of the}} numerical investigation: # 6063 T 5, (f 0 : 2 = 130 N=mm 2, high hardening, ultimate elongation "t = 8 %, and 50 % reduction of strength in HAZ) # 6061 T 6, (f 0 : 2 = 240 N=mm 2, low hardening, ultimate elongation "t = 8 %, and 52 % reduction of strength in HAZ) # 7020 T 6,(f 0 : 2 = 290 N=mm 2, <b>medium</b> <b>hardening,</b> ultimate elongation "t = 10 %, and 27 % reduction of strength in HAZ) An important problem concerning the use of aluminium sections in structural applications is the lack in standard aluminium pro le series (like IPB, HEA, HEB in steel). Additionally, an unwanted but nertheless unavoidable side effect of the welding process in aluminium is the creation of the so-called Heat A ected Zone (HAZ) on the immediate vicinity of the weld due to changes in the microstructure of aluminium alloys. In the HAZ the 'conventional' yield strength f 0 : 2 and ultimate strength fu of heat treated alloys are reduced up to 55 %, whereas ductility and other mechanical characteristics remain unaffected. # ## # The most widely applied method for the estimation of the width of the heat a ected zone is the well-known 'one inch rule'. According to this approach, HAZ's width is extended one inch in all directions from the vicinity of the weld. Similar approaches are proposed in regulations (DIN 4108). In Eurocode 9 the width of the HAZ is determined by the welding method and the weld size. In the present analysis, the more accurate and rational method, proposed by Richardson and Dwight and based on heat ow equations is used. Factors such as the size of the weld, the welding method, the thermal control of the welding procedure and uncertainities about the amount of the heat input (human factor) are herein considered. The alteration of the material behaviour due to the HAZ is introduced at a Gauss-point level in the model (the Castem 2000 software was used for that). Although in the developed software the possibility of a transition zone inside HAZ was also considered, this was not implemented into the parent analysis due to a luck in necessary bibliographical data concerning the phenomenon. The results of the analysis show early failure of the welded beam due to the accumulation of shear deformation in the boundary between the HAZ and the una ected material in the areas of the co-existence of high bending and shear. This failure mechanism constitutes a decoupling of the cross section in three parts (web and two independent anges) and seems to take place far earlier than the initiation of any plastic ow in an extruded (i. e HAZ-free) cross section A low value of the Ramberg-Osgood exponent n is shown to have a benign e ect on the failure mechanism shown. ...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for optical detection of substances in fluid or gaseous medium, comprises a carrier with molecules for {{the recognition of the}} substances to be detected that are immobilized on a surface (1) of the carrier or in the carrier on which the substances are selectively bindable. The light waves are superimposed into the carrier and are guided through the carrier. The carrier is a foil element out of transparent material in which a coupling structure for coupling of light waves is integrally formed and the coupled light waves are guidable. The coupling structure is formed in the molding step of the foil element {{on the surface of the}} foil elements in a step together with the formation of the foil element. The foil element is produced by stamping, rolling, pouring or <b>hardening</b> of fluid <b>medium.</b> The form of the coupling structure is formed during the stamping, rolling, pouring or hardening. A flow cell for the medium to be detected forms a measuring area with the surface of the foil elements. The coupling structure is arranged in the area covered by the flow cell. The molecules for the recognition of the substances to be detected are probes from biological and/or biochemical molecules such as antibody molecules, DNA molecules, single-stranded DNA, RNA molecules and/or single-stranded RNA that are immobilized on the surface of the foil element or in the foil element. The molecules form a selection field with measuring points for space-resolved detection of substances. The foil element has a homogenizing area that is arranged in optical path downstream the coupling structure and upstream a detecting point before the selection field so that light waves coupled in the foil element over the coupling structure shows a homogeneous groove before reaching the detecting point. A diffractive optical element e. g. a lattice structure is arranged in the optical path. The coupling structure has a vault comparable to a cylinder lens or round form to reach a homogeneous distribution of the light waves coupled in the foil element. The coupling element has a refractive optical element e. g. a prism or a lattice or a structure with a trapezoidal or rectangular cross-section. The coupling structure is a diffractive optical element. The thickness of the foil element is 10 - 1000 mu m and is selected in such a way that the foil element has flexibility. The foil thickness is 100 mu m. The foil element is molded with an external thickness area in the form of frame thus increasing the mechanical stability of the foil element. A polymer cartridge, in which the foil element is integrated, has an injection port for the medium to be detected, reagent container, fluidic channel for the transport of the medium and the reagent, and an arrangement for moving the medium and the reagent. An excitation optic for generation of light waves for stimulation of markers such as fluorescent dye related to the optical detection or for generation of color change on the surface or in the foil element in dependence of the medium to be detected. An arrangement is intended for the variation of a relative position of stimulation optics to the coupling structure, with which a coupling angle is selectable so that the coupling angle corresponds to the total reflection angle that arises itself with the refractive index of the medium adjacent to the foil element. In the optical path, a detector is arranged with which the light waves are detectable for the optimization of the radiation position and/or for the determination of reflection of the coupled light waves. The detector for the detection of the intensity of light waves at the coupling structure is arranged for the determination of absorption of the light waves guided in the foil element and its change. An image optic is measurable with the optical characteristics such as fluorescence characteristics or colors from the substances or markers on the surface or in the foil element. The foil element consists of glass that is produced by hot-stamping. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a procedure for the carriers for molecules for the detection of substances in fluid or gaseous medium.
