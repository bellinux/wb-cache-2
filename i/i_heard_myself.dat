500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After hearing Vedder's tape, former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament invited Vedder {{to come to}} Seattle to {{audition}} for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time, Gossard and Ament {{were working on the}} Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomer Mike McCready were also a part of the project. The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell later said of Vedder that [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] Vedder would provide background vocals on several other songs as well. In April 1991, Temple of the Dog was released through A Records. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. Vedder said about the song in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead; [...] "I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – [...] because one, I didn't write it, and two, it was such a nice way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I'm indebted to Chris [...] time eternal for being invited onto that track." [...] On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on – or the most meaningful.” Vedder and Cornell performed the song together for the last time on October 26, 2014 at the Bridge School Benefit.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> {{called by}} that imbecile. He was beckoning {{me to come}} up on his bridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all--at least I believe so. <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> {{that some}} such threat had been made, but I {{did not think}} that any tidings of it had got abroad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did so, indeed. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him <b>myself.</b> But he says {{also that}} he ought to remain here, at any rate for the next fortnight,--if mamma can permit it without inconvenience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, my dear Maria, was {{the first}} time that <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> called Philip for many a long year, and I fear that that was by accident; neither the name nor the blush were meant for me; now, where they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> apostrophised as a [...] "hard little thing;" [...] {{and it was}} added, [...] "any {{other woman}} would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, take we {{pleasure}} {{while we}} may," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> replying. [...] In the red sunset, far away, [...] My happier life was dying: [...] My heart was sad, {{my voice was}} gay.|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot change it, Mrs. Temple," [...] I answered, {{and fell}} back on the nettle-bark sheets. [...] "You cannot change it," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> repeating, {{as though it were}} another's voice. And I knew that Polly Ann was bending over me and calling me.|$|E
60|$|Now, mind! (said the German courier) I {{went with}} Mr. James into his brother's room, and <b>I</b> saw and <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> what follows.|$|R
60|$|Steele's next {{noteworthy}} {{achievement was}} as {{new to me}} as it was strange to Linrock. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{a good deal about}} it from my acquaintances, some little from Steele, and the concluding incident <b>I</b> saw and <b>heard</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Roland made no answer, but {{bit his lip}} {{till the}} blood came, and spurring his horse up {{to the side of}} Catherine Seyton's palfrey, he whispered in a low voice, [...] "I never thought to have done aught to deserve you; but this day <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> upbraided with cowardice, and my sword {{remained}} still sheathed, and all for the love of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|I can't {{name the}} {{exquisite}} pathos of the contradiction given {{to such a}} speech by such a speaker; I only know that the next instant <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> throw off with homely force: [...] "Stuff and nonsense!" [...] But the next after that I must have sounded stern enough. [...] "What WERE these things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Tommy sobbed in reply, [...] "That ain't it. I bounced so {{much about}} the Thrums folk to Shovel, and now the first day I'm here <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> {{bouncing}} about Shovel to Thrums folk, and it were that what made me cry. Oh, Elspeth, it's--it's not the same what I thought it would be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There is {{a hunter}} in us all. I laughed {{inwardly}} as I watched. A few months more and I was {{to watch a}} lion-tamer ... but let me keep to {{one thing at a}} time. I needled myself in, and, almost hooting the sound through my mouth, as if in echo of the bird, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> call stealthily across the air, [...] "Fanny!--Fanny Bowater!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can {{all this}} mean, Guert?" [...] he asked. [...] "Three times have we had {{warnings}} about 'Albany' and the 'river.' <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> this man <b>myself</b> utter those two words, and cannot be mistaken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{answered}} the Greek scholar, [...] "you are entirely correct. This {{has been an}} unfortunate day for me. I have been cunningly entrapped, and heartlessly deserted; I have been nearly frightened out of my wits; have had my soul nearly burned out of my body, and have been foully besmirched with dirt and mud. But, worse than all, <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> made the subject of contempt and contumely." ...|$|R
60|$|Almost could I tell it in four words. In {{them one}} {{would say that}} it is set forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic, vulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'. You 'ave <b>'eard</b> it? Yes? <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> it <b>myself,</b> and without emotion. It had no {{sinister}} warning for me. It did not strike me as omen. Yet, in those four words, monsieur, is my tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|During {{those five}} minutes I believe that I {{explored}} thoroughly the lowest circles of the Inferno {{which it is}} permitted man to tread on earth. And {{at the same time}} I myself was watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of doubt, misery, and utter despair. I wondered, as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered, which dreadful alternative I should adopt. Presently <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> answering in a voice that I hardly recognized,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} in the small valor of it that quite finished me: these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt overflow in a deluge. [...] "I'll tell you if you'll tell ME--" [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{the whip}} cracked. And then, {{as if at}} a signal, a vast, protracted, {{unanimous}} bawl poured up into space, a spout of sound, like a gigantic, invisible flower. [...] "That wasn't applause. But, you know, that wasn't applause," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> muttering. There can be no mistaking the sound of human mockery. There can be no mistaking that brutal wrench at the heart, under one's very ribs. I leapt round where I stood, {{in a kind of}} giddiness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Miss Pratt, 'I {{understand}} {{he is of}} a highly respectable family indeed, in Huntingdonshire. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him <b>myself</b> speak of his father's carriage--quite incidentally, you know--and Eliza tells me what very fine cambric handkerchiefs he uses. My eyes are {{not good enough to}} see such things, but I know what breeding is as well as most people, and {{it is easy to see}} that Mr. Tryan is quite comme il faw, to use a French expression.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said Mrs. Lecount. [...] "You have unintentionally saddened me; but the {{information}} I have received {{is not the}} less precious on that account. It is long, long ago, Mr. Bygrave, since <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> addressed {{in the language of}} science. My dear husband made me his companion--my dear husband improved my mind as you have been trying to improve it. Nobody has taken pains with my intellect since. Many thanks, sir. Your kind consideration for me is not thrown away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rotherwood {{is not the}} public,' said Lily, 'and he is {{the last}} person to say {{anything}} impertinent of papa. And <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> <b>heard</b> papa call her Alethea, which he never used to do. Claude, what do you think?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There couldn't be {{a better}} place or time." [...] He looked round him uneasily, and I had the rare--oh, the queer!--impression of the very first symptom I had seen in him of the {{approach}} of immediate fear. It {{was as if he were}} suddenly afraid of me--which struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque. [...] "You want so to go out again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|During {{those five}} minutes I believe that I {{explored}} thoroughly the lowest circles of the Inferno {{which it is}} permitted man to tread on earth. And {{at the same time}} I myself was watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of doubt, misery, and utter despair. I wondered, as Heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered, which dreadful alternative I should adopt. Presently <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> answering in a voice that I hardly recognized, [...] "--They're confoundedly particular about morality in these parts. Give 'em fits, Heatherlegh, and my love. Now let me sleep a bit longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|In summer, 1770, Mrs. Ricketts {{heard someone}} {{walk to the}} foot of her bed in her own room, [...] "the {{footsteps}} as distinct as ever <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>myself</b> perfectly awake and collected". Nobody could be discovered in the chamber. Mrs. Ricketts boldly clung to her room, and was only now and then disturbed by [...] "sounds of harmony," [...] and heavy thumps, down stairs. After this, and early in 1771, she was [...] "frequently sensible of a hollow murmuring that seemed to possess the whole house: it was independent of wind, being equally heard on the calmest nights, and it was a sound I had never been accustomed to hear".|$|E
60|$|During {{this time}} {{my mother used}} to be {{frequently}} telling me old stories of her former adventures, which, however, were no ways pleasant to me; for by it, though she did not tell it me in plain terms, yet I could easily understand, joined with what <b>I</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>myself,</b> of my first tutors, that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief; but I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both, and that she was then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "By my faith, and I {{hold the}} laddie {{to be in}} the right on't, Malcom!" [...] {{answered}} the stout old Scots lord.--"What right hath Buckingham, or, to speak plainly, the son of Sir George Villiers, to expect homage and fealty from one more noble than himself by eight quarters? <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him <b>myself,</b> on no reason that I could perceive, term Lord Nigel his enemy; and it will never be by my counsel that the lad speaks soft word to him, till he recalls the hard one." ...|$|R
60|$|DE LEVIS. [Tense too] You {{gave me that}} filly to save {{yourself}} her keep, and you've been mad about it ever since; you knew from Goole that I had sold her to Kentman and been paid in cash, yet <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> you <b>myself</b> deny that you knew it. You had the next room to me, and you can jump like a cat, as we saw that evening; I found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side. When I went to the bath your door was open, and when I came back it was shut.|$|R
60|$|But {{the friends}} of this paper have given me more uneasiness with their impatience, than its enemies by their answers. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> censured last week {{by some of the}} former, for {{promising}} to discover the corruptions in the late administration, but never performing any thing. The latter on the other side, are thundering out their anathemas against me for discovering so many. I am at a loss how to decide between these contraries, and shall therefore proceed after my own way, as I have hitherto done: my design being of more importance than that of writing only to gratify the spleen of one side, or provoke that of the other, though it may occasionally have both effects.|$|E
6000|$|Light simply {{poured in}} upon its gilt and brass and pale maroon from two high wide windows staring {{each other down}} from between their rich silk damask curtains. It was like {{entering}} an enormous bath, {{and it made me}} timid. In the midst of a large animal's skin, beneath a fine white marble chimney-piece, and under an ormolu clock, the parlour-maid was directed to place a cherry-coloured stool for me. Here I seated myself. With a fine, encouraging smile my hostess left me for a few minutes to myself. Maybe because an embroidered fire-screen that stood near reminded me of Miss Fenne, I pulled myself together. [...] "Don't be a ninny," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> murmur. My one hope and desire in this luxurious solitude was for the opportunity to deliver my message to Mr Crimble. This was not only a visit, it was an adventure. I looked about the flashing room; and it rather stared back at me.|$|E
6000|$|After a {{question}} and answer or two as to main facts of place and time of the discovery, Mr. Dutton told his story. 'I did not effect much with my inquiries after the circuses. All I heard of were of too superior an order for kidnapping practices. However, I thought the only way would be to haunt fairs and races, and look at their camp-followers. At a place in Hertfordshire I saw a performance advertised with several children as fairies, so I went to see it. I was soon satisfied that Alwyn was not there; but {{it struck me that}} I had known the face of the prime hero, a fine handsome supple fellow, who was called in the programme Herr Adalbert Steinfuggen, or some such name. Well, it seemed that he knew me, for as I struggled out after a considerable interval, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>myself</b> accosted, [...] "Mr. Dutton! Sir, surely I have the honour of speaking to Mr. Dutton of Micklethwayte?" [...] I assure you he was the very pink of politeness. Do you remember, Miss Egremont, Abel Stone?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man himself! This is {{even more}} interesting, Miss Silvester, than you suppose. <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> <b>heard</b> Mr. Speedwell warn Delamayn {{that he was in}} broken health, when we were visiting {{together}} at Windygates House last month. Did he do as the other men wished him? Did he speak to the surgeon?" ...|$|R
60|$|I had put {{precisely}} the same question to Mr. Bruff when I made my first inquiries about the Moonstone, on my return to England. In answering Ezra Jennings, I accordingly repeated what <b>I</b> had <b>myself</b> <b>heard</b> from the lawyer's own lips--and what is already familiar to the readers of these pages.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, Gervaise, {{you will}} not see them ill treated, for <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> <b>heard</b> Ricord, just before we were starting, tell the slave overseers that {{so long as the}} rowers did fair work they were not to use their whips, and that only if we were in chase of a pirate were they to be urged to their utmost exertions." ...|$|R
