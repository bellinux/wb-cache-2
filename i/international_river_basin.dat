50|$|Solutions to the {{challenges}} of water for energy and food security are hindered by shortcomings in water infrastructure, development, and management capacity {{to meet the demands of}} a rapidly growing population. This is compounded by the fact the Africa has the fastest urbanization rates in the world. Water development and management are much more complex due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers). Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 <b>international</b> <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> catchments that traverse multiple borders. This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area’s water resources. A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments. A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission. However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.|$|E

A 1957 United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) report, Development of Water Resources in the Lower Mekong Basin, recommended development to the tune of 90,000 km2 of irrigation and 13.7 gigawatts (GW) from five dams. [...] Based largely on the recommendations of ECAFE, the [...] "Committee for Coordination on the Lower Mekong Basin" [...] (known as the Mekong Committee) was established in September 1957 with the adoption of the Statute for the Committee for Coordination of Investigations into the Lower Mekong Basin. ECAFE’s Bureau of Flood Control had prioritized the Mekong - of the 18 international waterways within its jurisdiction - in the hopes of creating a precedent for cooperation elsewhere.

Without requisite quantity or quality of water, economic development as well as agricultural production would grind to a halt. This would lead to greater human suffering and threaten societal stability. Humanity’s primary sources of water are freshwater rivers. Most of the freshwater rivers are transboundary in nature, i.e., they cross at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary.

Further, a case study elucidating the connections between international cooperation and water quality in 14 international river basins in the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin is presented.

40|$|Abstract: From the Klamath basin in the Pacific Northwest to the Jordan basin in the Middle East, water {{conflicts}} can be disruptive, {{and affect}} {{a wide range}} of stakeholders, often with varying interests. As competition between water users and water use sectors increases, the potential for conflict increases, especially when governing institutions differ (Jarvis et al. 2005). However, research has shown that cooperation is more prevalent than conflict in <b>international</b> <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> (Wolf 1998; Wolf et al. 2003). As the demand for water approaches or meets available supply, intranational conflicts may increase (Postel and Wolf 2001). This paper explores cooperative and conflictive behavior over freshwater at two intranational scales in the western United States. Incidents of cooperation and conflict were collected and coded using a standardized classification system and compiled into event databases.

40|$|With {{increasing}} populations, urbanization {{and thus}} increasing demand for water, conflict on <b>International</b> <b>River</b> <b>basins</b> {{has been increasing}} over the years which has necessitated formation of <b>International</b> <b>River</b> frameworks to devise means of cooperation among the countries sharing the <b>river</b> <b>basins.</b> The main modes of cooperation in <b>international</b> <b>river</b> <b>basins</b> include allocating {{the waters of the}} river to the sharing countries such that each country manages its own water resources, or treating the <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> as one system and jointly managing and sharing the costs and benefits from the various services or use-sectors of the river. This research was aimed at reviewing and comparing international frameworks managing some of the rivers in Africa and Asia, and their structures, history and accomplishments. The countries sharing the Senegal River are Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea. The Senegal River was used as a case study because {{of the success of the}} OMVS, which is the organization managing the <b>river</b> <b>basin.</b> The OMVS has managed the river since 1972 and has succeeded in resolving water-related conflicts in the <b>basin.</b> The Senegal <b>River</b> <b>basin</b> countries are cooperating through joint management of the services and use-sectors fed by the river and thus sharing costs and benefits accumulated from use of the river. The benefits and costs from the project are calculated and then allocated through allocation models that were developed by the OMVS. The results in this research obtained from the Cost Allocation Model (as of 2011) which uses the Adjusted Separable Cost Remaining Benefit (ASCRB) method to allocate costs to the countries involved indicate that of the total project costs, Mali should pay 43. 9 %, Senegal should pay 38. 94 % and Mauritania should pay 17. 16 %.

40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2002. In the Twenty-first Century, {{sustainable}} {{water management}} {{is likely to}} be humanity's greatest challenge in a world of ever-increasing demand. Legal instruments both international and national regulate and provide a general framework for the use and management of international waters. Future basin management agreements can be informed by examining the degree of success, in terms of sustainability and equity, achieved by such agreements. That success can be influenced by the degree to which such agreements support the human right to water implicitly stated in international customary law, through a collaborative management approach. Since 1988, attempts by communities on the Pongolo floodplain to be involved in Pongolopoort Dam releases, have met with little success. Recently, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry has begun to support those efforts, but the approach remains a sectoral one, and is primarily concerned with water issues. The South African National Water Act 36 of 1998 provides for environmental management and public participation, as well as providing explicitly for the rights of individual water users, but its implementation is hampered by an overwhelming emphasis on technical considerations and a lack of political will to embrace collaborative management systems. Little effort is expended on collaborative management methods, though the level of transparency in water management is improving, despite remaining highly centralised. The level and extent of incentives for local community participation is low, and systematic monitoring is in its early development. <b>International</b> <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> agreements generally take a top-down or state-driven approach, though there are some examples where local cross-border communities have participated successfully in the implementation of international agreements and management of transboundary basins. South Africa, Swaziland and M 09 ambique signed the Interim Incomaputo Agreement, which includes the Maputo basin, in August 2002. Once again, the approach to this agreement has been highly sectoral in that negotiations were handled entirely by water officials in the relevant countries. A lack of transparency has prevailed in the negotiation stages, though through the basin studies, which will inform implementation plans, the level of participation should improve. There is overwhelming consensus that integrated management is the key to sustainable <b>international</b> <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> management. Formal and systematic methods for inter-departmental communication, both nationally and internationally are currently not being implemented, which has significant negative impacts on integrated management. Research in this area represents an opportunity to explore collaborative management of an <b>international</b> <b>river</b> <b>basin</b> in an area that is, as yet, unstressed in terms of population and water supply...|$|E

However, researchers seem to have overlooked the fact that floods do not recognize national boundaries.
