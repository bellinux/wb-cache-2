FS is the third most common disorder seen by rheumatologists, yet epidemiologic surveys are sparse. A questionnaire (the Northridge Questionnaire) was designed and validated which would: 1) determine {{whether there was a}} difference in self -report of clinical factors and symptoms for FS cases at three geographically distinct medical centers (Northridge Hospital; Univ. of Kansas at Wichita; Univ. of Texas at San Antonio), where three different sets of diagnostic criteria are used; and, 2) determine whether there was a difference between FS cases and matched normal controls for self -report of clinical factors and symptoms. Two hundred forty-three matched pairs participated in the questionnaire survey (mean age: cases= 51. 4 years, controls= 49. 7 years; 86...|$|E
40|$|This book is {{well written}} and {{presented}} with clear headings, tables and illustrations. It {{is also very}} well referenced. The authors have tried {{to address the problem}} of non-articular and non-inflammatory conditions when these need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. A very relaxed interpretation of what constituted 'soft tissue ' has allowed the inclusion of conditions such as osteochondritis, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Conversely, virtually no mention is made of metabolic and endocrine causes of soft tissue rheumatic pain. Throughout the book the emphasis is on establishing a diagnosis from the history and examination without resorting to unnecessary and expensive investigations. Features that warrant further investigation are clearly stated. Similarly, stress is placed on patient management including preventative measures, education, intra-lesional injection techniques and detailed exercise regimes. The commoner soft tissue rheumatic problems are dealt with according to anatomical site. The chapters on the knee and ankle and foot are particularly useful, but I found the chapter on the shoulder repetitive and confusing. The statement 'Frozen shoulder begins insidiously and is not often a cause for severe pain ' must be questioned. The last few chapters cover a miscellany of topics, including <b>fibrositis</b> <b>syndrome,</b> psychogenic rheumatism and the management of chronic persistent pain syndrome. In summary, this book deals comprehensively with the commoner non-inflammatory soft tissue rheumatic diseases. It will also be of particular interest to the Rheumatologist, Orthopaedic Surgeon and some General Practitioners. Although not directly specifically at the Sports Medicine market, the excellent advice on the management of overuse syndromes will make this a very useful book for anyone dealing with sports injuries...|$|E
