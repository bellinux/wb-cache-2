5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life.

This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did.
