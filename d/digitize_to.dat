40|$|The pressures, {{from outside}} and inside {{education}} to <b>digitize,</b> <b>to</b> computerise, and 'to go online' {{continue to increase}} in pace. The rhetoric surrounding such pressures are often argued from a standpoint that positions technology as a 'neutral tool', a tool that will help make work more efficient and effective. The central thesis of this presentation is that technology is best understood as fundamentally non-neutral and that various technological applications privilege certain ways of doing things, and exclude or restrict other ways. And further, that technology not only can influence but can have a transformative effect on what the technology is used for, and on the work practices of those that use it. Technology is often viewed for what it provides and seldom for what it takes away or limits. This presentation aims {{to draw attention to}} practices and changes in work practices in education, brought about, in part, or in whole, by the use of the new communication and information technologies. In order to draw attention to these changed practices, the structure, in this presentation, has been organised under four broad categories, namely: new pedagogical opportunities, changed practices, technology neutrality, and unintended consequences. The first half hour of the seminar will be for the initial presentation, the remainder of the seminar will be for questions and answers and general discussion. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|A data {{acquisition}} system (DAS), developed to track dynamically the beams in the DAΦNE Φ-Factory is presented in this paper. From a hardware point of view, the DAS is composed of two oscilloscopes and a personal computer, connected together through an IEEE 488 interface. The software is written in LABVIEW 6. 0 and it is portable on different platforms. It produces as output a database that can be read by any spreadsheet or text editor. A LECROY LC 584 AM/LC 574 A oscilloscope, built around a PowerPC working at 96 MHz, can <b>digitize</b> <b>to</b> 8 -bit waveforms from four channels. Special feature of this oscilloscope is the capability of being synchronized with an external clock in the range 50 - 500 MHz. The clock signal RF/ 6 is generated by the DAΦNE Timing System. It allows to select anyone between the 120 bunches using a phase shifter. The oscilloscope samples difference and sum signals in the horizontal and vertical plans from a Beam Position Monitor (BPM). A second oscilloscope can sample synchronously four signals from another BPM (this feature is under development). It is possible to store up to 500 k contiguous fixed-point values for each channel; these data correspond to a record of 25 k consecutive bunch turns in the Main Ring. The system is standalone, even though the operator can work remotely from the consoles of the DAΦNE control system. If the record is considered valid, data are downloaded to the computer; the transfer of up to 1 Mbyte for each channel is done {{as quickly as possible}} to perform many measurements without delaying the machine operations. Then the measurements are converted to millimetres by a suitable algorithm; besides other beam data are calculated using machine parameters or the Hilbert transform. Finally, data are automatically inserted in a database tree that is built using time stamps and can be remotely accessed by the users. Off-line retrieval and presentation tools are also developed in LABVIEW. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new similarity metric for planar point sets called the quadrant Hausdorff distance. This new metric is a modification of the Hausdorff distance {{that is consistent with}} the digitization process: Any two digital objects differ by at most quadrant Hausdorff distance one if and only if there is a planar object that <b>digitizes</b> <b>to</b> both of them under an idealized model of the digitization process. The implication ") " does not hold for Hausdorff distance, i. e., if two digital objects differ by at most Hausdorff distance one, there does not necessarily exist a planar object that <b>digitizes</b> <b>to</b> both of them. However, in many applications on digital sets such as character recognition, bitmaps are often grouped into equivalence classes and considered to be digitizations of the same continuous prototype character based on Hausdorff distance one. The consistency of the quadrant Hausdorff distance with the digitization process gives us a theoretical foundation to treat di [...] ...|$|R
