50|$|In the UK, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), {{was under}} the {{supervision}} of the Foreign Secretary and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which led, on at least one occasion, to allegations of a connection between the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and the achievement of either foreign policy goals or British companies winning export orders. A scandal erupted concerning the UK funding of a hydroelectric dam on the Pergau River in Malaysia, near the Thai border. Building work began in 1991 with money from the UK foreign aid budget. Concurrently, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion worth of arms from the UK. The suggested linkage of arms deals to aid became the subject of a UK government inquiry from March 1994. In November 1994, after an application for Judicial Review brought by the World Development Movement, the High Court held that the then Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd had acted ultra vires (outside of his power and therefore illegally) by allocating £234 million towards the funding of the dam, on the grounds that it was not of economic or humanitarian benefit to the Malaysian people http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0045540.html. In 1997 the administration of the UK's aid budget was removed from the Foreign Secretary's remit with the establishment of the Department for International Development (DfID) which replaced the ODA.|$|E
40|$|The Treaty of Rome imposed {{the duty}} on the European Community of supervising the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> by public bodies to private {{industry}} where this distorts or threatens to distort competition. This competence {{is unique to}} the European Community [...] giving power to the Community to regulate national and regional industrial policy. This area is of interest to lawyers, political scientists, and economists. Recent and current high profile cases in the airline and banking sectors have raised awareness of this under-researched area. DG-IV has increasingly relied on a strategy of producing communications and frameworks to impose legal coherence in the control of State Aid, but these are at present of dubious legal effect, and have themselves been challenged before the Community Courts. A recent case "reinterpreted" a framework {{so that it was}} deemed to have expired six months previously. From the practical point of view, therefore, if the Commission is to use "legislative-type" instruments, as distinguished from mere statements of policy, and encourage those with which it deals to rely on them, there must be the confidence that these will survive legal challenge. However, the subject of this paper raises broader issues than the control of State aid, important though this is. The accordance of a legally binding effect to some of these sectoral aid disciplines constitutes a source of law which has only comparatively recently been recognised as a source of legal obligation. This paper therefore constitutes a case study of the birth of a novel source of "law," a record of the attempt by the Courts of the European Community to determine the boundary between "real" law and "mere" politics. The area examined is certainly not settled; many contradictions remain which will no doubt be clarified in future court challenges...|$|E

Because the {{procurement}} of infrastructures {{is by far}} associated with states policies and other industries, conflicts about states aids are apt to occur. In European law the state aid lies on the borderline between prohibition and permission. Therefore a study about it is very meaningful. In awarding procurements it is to judge whether a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>aids</b> corresponds certain undertakings or the production of certain goods and distorts competition. A valid notice about aids is also important. In addition that is a case, if the construction of infrastructure or awarding a concession-procurement represents an aid itself.

40|$|During the 1990 s, Australian Legal Aid Commissions {{introduced}} a range <b>of</b> new legal <b>aid</b> services {{designed to address}} unmet needs while minimising the cost <b>of</b> legal <b>aid.</b> These services departed from the traditional models <b>of</b> legal <b>aid</b> services {{in the form of}} legal advice, minor assistance or full legal representation.

50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{said that the}} Emperor Leopold I obtained a declaration of Reichskrieg (or Reichskriegserklärung) against France in 1674 during the Franco-Dutch War, In fact, Leopold had expelled the French ambassador to the Empire from Regensburg in March 1674 and informed the diet that he considered France {{an enemy of the}} Empire. Taking advantage of the general anti-French mood, he secured the diet's sanction <b>of</b> imperial <b>aid</b> to the Electoral Palatinate and other territories threatened by the French on 31 March. In April and May, the emperor issued further decrees implementing the diet's <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> His decision not to call for a Reichskrieg forced him to lean heavily on the militarised princes and thus further increased their standing and influence in the Empire. Although the diet, at the suggestion of the French king, Louis XIV, considered sending its own representative to the peace conference at Nijmegen in 1675-76, this was vetoed by Leopold, who asserted that since it was not a Reichskrieg he retained full authority to negotiate on the empire's behalf. This set a precedent that was upheld even in future Reichskriege in 1697 and 1714: the emperor could negotiate peace without the diet. The negotiated treaty, however, had still to be ratified by the diet.|$|R
