40|$|Erythromelalgia {{is a rare}} {{neurovascular}} pain syndrome {{characterized by}} a triad of redness, increased temperature, and burning pain primarily in the extremities. Erythromelalgia can present as a primary or secondary form, and secondary erythromelalgia associated with a myeloproliferative disease such as essential thrombocythemia often responds dramatically to aspirin therapy, as in the present case. Herein, we describe a typical case of a 48 -year-old woman with secondary erythromelalgia linked to essential thrombocythemia in the unilateral hand.
