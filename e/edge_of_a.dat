5|$|During {{the senior}} overnight, Destiny meets Renz, shoves a wooden tent pole {{through his body}} and kills him. Her father appears, and tells her {{that he is the}} Restorer. He cures her, and they go and find Livvy and her friend Ross Starr at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grassy clearing. Livvy tells Destiny and her father that she has been immortal since camp, and that she and Ross {{exchanged}} blood. Livvy and Ross change into blackbirds, and fly off into the black sky.|$|E
5|$|Gradual {{development}} {{took place}} as convection consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation while located west of Sonora. During the afternoon of September20, an {{area of low pressure}} developed within the system, prompting the NHC to classify it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 240mi (390km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. Situated along the western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical ridge, the system was steered towards the north-northwest throughout its existence.|$|E

5|$|Having {{detected}} the U.S. aircraft which deployed Snake flying over Soviet soil, the Soviet Union declares the United States {{responsible for the}} nuclear attack, tipping both nations to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nuclear war. In a secret conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, a deal is hatched to prove the U.S.'s innocence and restore peace. The United States agrees to stop Volgin's renegade faction, destroy the stolen Shagohod and eliminate the American defector, The Boss.|$|E
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which {{is located on the}} equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E

5|$|When {{exploiting}} distant {{food sources}} found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black spruce forest in interior Alaska. This allowed {{a high rate}} of caching in the short term and reduced the jay's risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.|$|E
5|$|While at peak intensity, Jery began {{turning to}} the south, due to {{reaching}} the western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ridge. An approaching trough increased wind shear over the storm, causing the convection to diminish and expose the center. Late on April10 it weakened below tropical cyclone status, {{and the next day}} Jery became extratropical. Shortly thereafter the remnants crossed into the Australian region, dissipating on April13.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. It slowly strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving near the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter {{under the influence of}} wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the <b>Edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> magnetosheathâ€”a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

Monkey Smash is an open arena, deathmatch-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all of their own lives. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> platform. Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.|$|E
5|$|During September 12, the {{depression}} continued to develop quickly {{with both the}} JMA and the JTWC reporting that {{the depression}} had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915. During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye. During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst moving along the southwestern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep level subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed into the hands of Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|E

Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> residential yet wooded area to reach NY104.
