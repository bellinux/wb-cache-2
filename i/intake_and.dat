5|$|A D-21 {{mounted on}} an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. Aerodynamic covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> exhaust to reduce drag, but {{had to be removed}} after the first few tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on land, they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> exhaust pipes of boats.

5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> {{the engine}} {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} iodine {{was present}} in seaweed, and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet. Gaspard Adolphe Chatin proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter {{was the result of}} not enough iodine <b>intake,</b> <b>and</b> Eugen Baumann demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college). Overall, the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> {{careers of}} undergraduates remained {{dominated by the}} Church (up to half), drawn {{from a range of}} backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E
50|$|The Mirage 4000 was noticeably {{larger and}} {{heavier than the}} single-engined Mirage 2000, the 4000 having two SNECMA M53-2 turbofans. It also {{featured}} small canards above the engine air <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> a true bubble canopy, compared to the Mirage 2000 and previous Mirages. Despite the changes, the two aircraft remained similar, sharing the delta wing design, semi-circular air <b>intakes,</b> <b>and</b> general configuration.|$|R

5|$|In 1974, R.A. Powell raised two fisher kits for {{the purpose}} of {{performing}} scientific research. His primary interest was an attempt to measure the activity of fishers in order to determine how much food the animals required to function. He did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in the wild. He compared this to their food <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> used the data to estimate daily food requirements. The research lasted for two years. After one year, one of the fishers died due to unknown causes. The second was released back into the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Kuhnke assumed {{command of}} the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon {{arriving}} at Flensburg. He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Schnorchel, a retractable air <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E
5|$|Mature plasmodia {{can produce}} fruit bodies under {{appropriate}} circumstances, the exact triggers for this process are unknown. According to laboratory researchers, changes in humidity, temperature or pH value {{as well as}} starvation periods {{were thought to be}} the triggers in some species. The plasmodia abandon their nutrient <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> crawl, attracted by lighta positive phototaxistowards a dry, light area, to get an optimal spread of the spores. Once the fructification begins, it can not be stopped. If disturbances occur, malformed spore-bearing fruit bodies are often produced.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The Senior Prom {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to be expendable; however, it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and inflatable landing bag located under the fuselage. The aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with folding wings to facilicate carriage by the launching aircraft, and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} that both {{adults and children}} reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries (cavities in the teeth). These recommendations {{were based on the}} totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> body weight and dental caries. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-1930s, {{when the}} first {{commercial}} yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, vitamins were obtained solely through food <b>intake,</b> <b>and</b> changes in diet (which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingested. However, vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, {{since the middle of}} the 20th century. Study of structural activity, function and their role in maintaining health is called vitaminology.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol <b>intake,</b> <b>and</b> stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid <b>intake,</b> <b>and</b> antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first <b>intake</b> <b>and</b> given a bursary to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons {{that he decided to}} become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of the}} author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.|$|E

40|$|Background/Objectives: Globally, fruit <b>and</b> {{vegetable}} <b>intakes</b> {{are well}} below recommendations despite ample evidence to link insufficient intake with {{increased risk of}} overweight <b>and</b> obesity. <b>Intakes</b> of fruits <b>and</b> vegetables {{in the general population}} differ between males and females, and although there is growing evidence of <b>intakes</b> in men <b>and</b> women during weight loss, evidence that directly compares <b>intakes</b> in men <b>and</b> women during weight loss is lacking. This study aimed to identify any differences between males and females in fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> plasma carotenoid concentrations during weight loss, and determine whether there is a relationship between any changes in fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> weight change in both males and females. Subjects/Methods: Men and women (n= 100; body mass index 25 - 40 kg/m¹) aged 18 - 60 years were selected for the study. Dietary <b>intake</b> of fruits <b>and</b> vegetables was assessed using the Australian Eating Survey and fasting blood was collected to assess plasma carotenoids, which were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: There was little change in fruit or vegetable intakes during weight loss, although men tended to increase fruit intakes. Changes in intakes were influenced by baseline <b>intakes,</b> with males <b>and</b> females with the highest intakes at baseline reducing intakes. Males had better correlations between fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>intakes</b> <b>and</b> plasma carotenoid concentrations than females, and fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>intakes</b> during weight loss appear to predict weight loss for males but not females. Conclusions: Fruit <b>and</b> vegetable <b>intake</b> during weight loss does not appear to differ largely between males and females...|$|R
