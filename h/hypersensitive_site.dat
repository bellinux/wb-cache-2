This study compares the structure of the human prepro-GRP gene in four SCLC cell lines that express variable levels of steady-state GRP mRNA. The regulation of GRP gene expression appears to be at the level of primary transcription based on nuclear run on studies. In the two SCLC cell lines expressing GRP we find a single transcription start site for GRP mRNA, and near this site we find four DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites.</b> These <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> are absent in the two cell lines that do not express GRP.

Hybridizing micrococcal nuclease digests to a probe from in between the two upstream <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> leads to an interruption of an otherwise regular nucleosomal DNA pattern.

In this study, we report the identification of a novel DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> within a putative regulatory region of the human HLA-DRA gene, the so-called far upstream region.

40|$|We were {{interested}} in identifying cis-acting elements that regulate germline transcription and switch recombination of heavy chain genes. The murine γ 1 heavy chain gene includes two DNase I hypersensitive sites, which may represent protein:DNA interactions important for germline transcription and switch recombination. One DNase <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> is at the promoter/I exon boundary (termed ‘Site I’); we localized a second pair of DNase hypersensitive sites to just 5 � of the Sγ 1 region (termed ‘Site II’). The DNA region of <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>Site</b> II includes a NF-κB/Rel binding site and a STAT 6 binding site. It is noteworthy that NF-κB and STAT 6 are induced by the same agents (CD 40 ligation and IL- 4 respectively) that stimulate germline transcription and switch recombination of the murine γ 1 gene. Transgenes with the γ 1 promoter region (DNase <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>Site</b> I), Iγ 1 and DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>Site</b> II expressed germline transcripts with correct regulation, including IL- 4 inducibility.

A tandem repeat of the consensus sequence for the transcription factors AP 1 and NF-E 2 (activating protein 1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2, respectively) is present within <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> 2 and is absolutely required for strong enhancer activity. This sequence binds, in vitro and in vivo, to ubiquitous proteins of the AP 1 family and to the recently cloned erythroid-specific transcription factor NF-E 2.

The gene, which we named Nrf 2 (NF-E 2 -related factor 2), is encoded within a 2. 2 -kb transcript and predicts a 66 -kDa protein with a basic leucine zipper DNA binding domain highly homologous to that of NF-E 2. Although Nrf 2 is expressed ubiquitously, a role of this protein in mediating enhancer activity of <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> 2 in erythroid cells cannot be excluded.

40|$|Transcriptional {{activation}} by steroid hormones {{is often}} associated with the appearance of a DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> resulting from a local alteration of the nucleoprotein structure of the promoter. For the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat, a viral promoter under glucocorticoid control, a model has been proposed: the appearance of the hormonodependent DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> reflects the displacement of a single precisely positioned nucleosome associated with the glucocorticoid responsive elements. To determine if such a mechanism is of general relevance in transcriptional activation by steroid hormones, we have investigated the nucleosomal organization of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter over a 1 -kilobase region that contains the glucocorticoid regulatory target. This region displays a hormonodependent DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site.</b> In the absence of hormone, micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei demonstrates the presence of positioned nucleosomes, with cutting sites centered around positions - 3080, - 2900, - 2700, - 2800, - 2255, and - 2040. Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone induces a disruption of the chromatin structure over a relatively short stretch of DNA (approximately positions - 2400 to - 2650) that overlaps two nucleosomes. These observations suggest a strong similarity in the role of chromatin structure in glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activation of mouse mammary tumor virus and tyrosine aminotransferase promoters...|$|E

40|$|HS- 40 is {{the major}} {{regulatory}} element of the human alpha-globin locus, located 40 kb upstream of the zeta-globin gene. To test for potential interactions between HS- 40 and the beta- or the gamma-globin gene promoters in stable transfection assays, the HS- 40 core sequence was cloned upstream of either the beta promoter or the gamma promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and enhancer activity was measured using a colony assay. In K 562 or in MEL cells, enhancer activity of HS- 40 was {{higher than that of}} the individual core sequences of the DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> (HS) of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR), and approximately 60 % of the enhancer activity of a 2. 5 kb microLCR, which contains the core elements of DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> 1 - 4. In contrast to the synergistic interaction between the DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> of beta locus LCR, combination of HS- 40 with these DNase I <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>sites</b> failed to display cooperativity in K 562 cells and inhibited enhancer function in MEL cells.

To study {{the effect of the}} individual upstream hypersensitive sites on transgene expression, we produced lines of mice in which the individual upstream sites were linked to the beta A gene and enhancer. RNA levels were measured in blood from adult animals. With each of these four constructs, the level of transgene RNA per DNA copy varied over a > 20 -fold range. These data suggest that addition of a <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> to the beta A-globin/enhancer region abrogates its position independent expression. The average beta A-globin expression per copy in the lines carrying an upstream site was comparable with that in lines without an upstream site. Thus, no single upstream <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>site</b> accounts for the higher level of beta A-globin expression seen in mice containing the complete upstream region.
