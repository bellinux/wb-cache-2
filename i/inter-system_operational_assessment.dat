50|$|Development {{cost overruns}} placed the Global Hawk {{at risk of}} cancellation. In mid-2006, per-unit costs were 25% over {{baseline}} estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies {{as well as to}} increase its capabilities. This caused concern over a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified. However, in June 2006, the program was restructured. Completion of an <b>operational</b> <b>assessment</b> report by the USAF was delayed from August 2005-November 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays.

30|$|As the {{increasing}} scale of power {{systems and the}} growing reliance of human society on electricity, the losses of the power system blackout become larger than ever before. The capability of power system that could serve the load securely and reliably is attracting more and more attentions. Based on the theory of risk assessment in the power system planning studies, the theory and the methodology of <b>operational</b> risk <b>assessment</b> of power systems have been proposed [1]. The <b>operational</b> risk <b>assessment</b> quantifies the mid-short-term or even real-time risk level of power systems according to the status and external environment of the generation and transmission facilities. The results of <b>operational</b> risk <b>assessment</b> can help the power system operator make wise dispatching decisions.

5000|$|On 17 November 2015, the MQ-4C began {{a two-month}} <b>operational</b> <b>assessment</b> that will {{determine}} Milestone C approval {{and the start of}} low-rate initial production. In February 2016 the U.S. Navy confirmed that the MQ-4C had completed <b>Operational</b> <b>Assessment,</b> putting the Triton in line to achieve a Milestone C decision in spring 2016, leading to low rate production. An integrated test team made up of Navy personnel from Air Test and Evaluation Sqdns. VX-1 and VX-20, Unmanned Patrol Sqdn., VUP-19 and Northrop Grumman demonstrated Triton’s reliability over approximately sixty flight hours. The Navy’s fiscal 2017 budget request includes 19 MQ-4 Tritons through fiscal 2021, with first deployment to the Pacific in fiscal 2017. The tests evaluated the MQ-4C’s key sensors - an active electronically scanned array radar, an electro-optic/infrared camera and a hydrocarbon detector - over different altitudes and ranges, analysing the [...] "system’s ability to classify targets and disseminate critical data", according to Northrop.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{shares of}} {{fluctuating}} {{renewable energy sources}} induce higher and higher power flow variability at the transmission level. The question arises as to what extent existing networks can absorb additional fluctuating power injection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resulting power flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to line temperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling and simulation methodology for estimating the occurrence of critical line temperatures {{in the presence of}} fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integration of the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is sped up by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction technique adapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction in computational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant to short-term <b>operational</b> <b>assessments.</b> A case study performed on a single line model provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting critical line temperatures under given power flow fluctuations. A transmission system application shows how the proposed method can be used for a fast yet accurate <b>operational</b> <b>assessment...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{method by which}} the V- 22 Multiservice Operational Test Team (MOTT) {{collects}} and analyzes subjective operational test data, and suggests improvements to the tools currently in use. The MOTT uses a Microsoft Access custom application to generate and administer questionnaires and report summary results of the data collected. Using Visual Basic for Applications to implement Automation techniques, specific program improvements are created and implemented that use basic summary statistics to assist in handling the problems of excessive questionnaire lengths and user friendly summary report generation. A trend analysis is conducted on data from a previous <b>operational</b> <b>assessment</b> in terms of MOTT pilot demographics to highlight any response biases exhibited by subsets of participants. Analysis techniques are demonstrated and specific findings are {{discussed in terms of}} potential to affect future test results. In addition, cluster analysis is used to investigate an improved structure for the generic maintenance questionnaire used in a previous <b>operational</b> <b>assessment.</b> Suggestions are put forth for aggregating questions and creating a more efficient maintenance questionnaire.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis decomposed {{the problem of}} <b>operational</b> <b>assessments</b> within the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) and then proposed a comprehensive framework to better address the challenge. This analysis was conducted for the United States Southern Command but is generalizable to other GPOI implementers, including other combat commands as well as State Department offices. The problem space was considered using standard systems engineering techniques such as stakeholder and functional analyses. Given the complex and ill-defined nature of the problem, systems architecting methods were applied to lend structure to the solution space; specifically, a capabilities-based architecture, adapted from an existing IT model, was used to generate a coherent framework. The proposed architecture balanced technical and non-technical elements {{of the system and}} provided a means to develop appropriate metrics that were traceable to the stated objectives and outcomes. The assessment framework was built from a systems engineering viewpoint; however, several heuristics from the field of <b>operational</b> <b>assessments</b> were also employed to provide additional practical improvements. The findings proposed that the GPOI adopt a coherent assessment framework that emphasizes traceability of all metrics and a more complete measurement of the GPOI system.
