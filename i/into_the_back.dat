5|$|At the , Webber crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Heikki Kovalainen's Lotus, {{sending the}} car {{flying through the}} air, {{collecting}} a track advertising board and landing upside down. The car then bounced back and crashed into the tyre barrier at high speed. Webber received only minor injuries, but retired from the race.|$|E
5|$|Between {{late spring}} and early fall, much of the park can be {{accessed}} for multiple-day backpacking trips. All overnight trips <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> country require a wilderness permit and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E
30|$|Female 4 -week-old BALB/c nude mice were {{injected}} with 5  ×  106 SMMC 7721 -mock or SMMC 7721 -FXYD 6 cells subcutaneously <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> (6 mice per group). For antibody treatment, xenografts of human tumor cell lines were produced by injecting 1  ×  106 HepG 2 cells subcutaneously <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of <b>the</b> mice. When tumors reached {{a diameter of}} 0.5 – 0.6  cm, the mice were grouped (5 mice per group) and intraperitoneally {{injected with}} mIgG or purified FD 10 at a dose of 200  μg per mouse twice per week. Tumor size was measured twice per week and tumor volume was determined according to the following equation: tumor size = width 2  × length × (1 / 2).|$|R
50|$|England came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game making two {{changes from}} the {{previous}} test. Prop Frank Whitcombe was replaced by George Curran and Eric Batten was recalled to the wing. Australia made five changes with Trevor Eather, Noel White and Clem Kennedy being called up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> while Jim Armstrong and Noel Mulligan came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forwards.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, each pilot also used a smaller aircraft, which was flown in through small hatches <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of <b>the</b> robots in order to pilot the robots. The three aircraft could also combine into a single jet called the Super Abega.|$|R
5|$|In {{the video}} Rihanna and two friends {{arrive at a}} nightclub in a yellow taxi, and enter a candy store where a boy is {{standing}} with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 2009, at 4:27am, two trains {{collided}} at the West Falls Church train yard. One train {{pulled in}} and collided <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{of the other}} train. No customers were aboard, and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported. However, three cars (1106, 1171, and 3216) {{were believed to be}} damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Queen's went on {{the attack}} once again, with Christie going on a run but losing {{possession}} to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas {{who went on to}} score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took the ball up the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time.|$|E

50|$|Highly elastic fabrics such as Lycra/Spandex {{have mostly}} {{replaced}} raw nylon <b>backing,</b> since <b>the</b> nylon by itself cannot be stretched {{and makes the}} neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> permits {{a large amount of}} stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become closer fitting.|$|R

5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began with}} Kubica in pole {{position}} alongside Massa; Lewis Hamilton, the eventual Drivers' Champion, started from third, alongside Räikkönen. Kubica {{was passed by}} Massa into the first corner, and then by Räikkönen on the third lap. The Ferraris dominated {{at the front of}} the race, leading to their 1–2 finish. Hamilton had a slow start after almost stalling on the grid, and dropped back to ninth. The McLaren driver ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Fernando Alonso's Renault a lap later, breaking off the McLaren's front wing and dropping Hamilton to the back of the field.|$|E
50|$|The trucks move {{north from}} North Carolina to Virginia and Maryland for beans, asparagus, and tomatoes. Every year, there are {{accidents}} {{on the road}} that often result in injury or death since workers are very compactly packed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of trucks. There is no interstate standard for the transportation of migrant workers.|$|R

30|$|Subcutaneous air pouches were {{produced}} under ketamine anesthesia. Twenty-four milliliters sterile air was injected subcutaneously through a 0.25  μm microfilter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of <b>the</b> animals {{to create a}} pseudosynovial cavity (Ferrari et al. 1996; Nagase et al. 1998). A second air injection was given 3  days after, if needed, to keep the air pouch inflated.|$|R
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his truck.|$|E
5|$|Frankie dies next at a drive-through, when {{a runaway}} truck crashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Kevin's truck {{and the engine}} fan blows out. The next day, Wendy and Kevin try to save Lewis at the gym; he tells them {{that he does not}} believe them shortly before two weights from the weight {{training}} machine he is using swing down and decapitate him. Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head. Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of carpet like twists, which is {{commonly referred to as}} a berber. Twist carpeting is composed of multiple twisted fibers set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carpet <b>backing.</b> It is typically used in low traffic areas. Another type of carpeting is looped carpets, which are composed of looped fibers set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carpet <b>backing.</b> This type of carpeting is typically used in high traffic areas as it is easy to clean.|$|R
50|$|A staple gun {{is usually}} a heavier duty, {{hand-held}} device; it can be strictly manual or pneumatic. Staple guns are used to fasten a thin material to a solid backing—such {{as a piece of}} paper to a bulletin board, or to a piece of wood. The two legs of a staple from a staple gun are not folded over, but are embedded straight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> material.|$|R
5000|$|K2tog tbl ("knit two {{together}} through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> loops") -- This looks {{similar to the}} SSK or S1, K, PSSO, but is faster to work. Work to the two stitches to be decreased, then insert the right hand needle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of <b>the</b> next two stitches (i.e. behind the left-hand needle, such that the two needles are anti-parallel in the stitches). Wrap the yarn normally and slip the two stitches off the left needle. This makes a left-leaning decrease.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E

They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed {{at the disposal of}} the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
5|$|Many {{basketball}} commentators picked UTEP to {{pull the}} upset, and at halftime it looked like they might be right, as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens {{made a number of}} halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59. Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the hidden zipper {{started to make}} its way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of dresses, skirts, and other garments, thereby making back {{closures}} not so noticeable. But since 2010, {{there has been a}} style to have extra conspicuous zippers on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of dresses, skirts, and blouses, which on not all garments need to be opened to don or remove the garment. Some have fancy pull tabs. Others expose on the exterior not only the teeth of the zipper but also the fabric.|$|R

5|$|On 21 May 2010, Chamakh {{completed}} his move to Arsenal on a free transfer after completing {{his contract with}} Bordeaux. The transfer took effect on 1 July 2010. He made his debut in a pre-season friendly against Barnet on 17 July, appearing as a substitute. On 27 July, he scored his first pre-season goal for the club, converting a penalty in a 4–0 victory over Austrian club SC Neusiedl. In the 2010 edition of the Emirates Cup, Chamakh scored on his home debut against Italian club Milan. On 7 August 2010, he scored the first goal in 6-5 win against Legia Warsaw in a friendly match and the last match for pre-season. He made his Premier League debut on 15 August in the team's 1–1 draw with Liverpool. Chamakh contributed to the team's equalising goal by heading a cross off the goal post, which then redirected off goalkeeper Pepe Reina and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the net, resulting in an own goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship between Randy Orton and Cactus Jack. Three months prior at the Royal Rumble, after Mick Foley {{eliminated}} Orton from the Royal Rumble match, Orton hit Foley with a steel chair, and the two brawled up the ramp and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> In March at WrestleMania XX, Evolution (Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) faced off against The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Foley and The Rock) in a Handicap match. Evolution won the match when Orton pinned Foley after an RKO. Two weeks later, Foley challenged Orton to a Hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Backlash, which Orton accepted that same night.|$|E
5|$|With the Mujahideen's help, Bond {{plants a}} bomb aboard the cargo plane {{carrying}} the opium, but is spotted {{and has no}} choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E
