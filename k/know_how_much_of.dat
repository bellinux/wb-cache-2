He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E

The pests have been able to infest more because trees are weak due to drought conditions.|$|E

Bowser had recently provided $700,000 in taxpayer funding and appointed four members {{to the board of}} the organization, also known as the City Youth Investment Trust Corp. Bowser's representatives did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the funding remained or how youth services could be continued.

25|$|It is {{frequently}} important to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically {{required for a}} given algorithm. Methods {{have been developed for}} the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act {{out most of the}} lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E

Being young myself, I just thought, 'It's about time – {{of course we}} should have acid house at Glastonbury'. It used to annoy me. I just used to {{think it should be}} happening." [...] In the same article Michael Eavis noted that the Orbital gig marked dance music's appearance on the mainstream agenda. [...] "What was previously underground made it on to one of the big stages, and there was no going back from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers' fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal." ...|$|E

It was at this time that Lewis recognized that he {{had fallen in love with}} her, realizing how despondent he would feel to lose her. He wrote to a friend: [...] "new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life. You would be surprised (or perhaps you would not?) to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us." [...] Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer. In March 1957, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary: [...] "One of the most painful days of my life.
