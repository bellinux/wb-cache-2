The basic concept used by the proposed security architecture is the Trusted Third Party (TTP). A TTP is used in order to generate, distribute and revoke <b>digital</b> <b>certi</b> ® cates to medical practitioners and healthcare organizations that wish to communicate securely. <b>Digital</b> <b>certi</b> ® cates and digital signatures are used to provide peer and data origin authentication and access control. The paper demonstrates how TTPs can be used eå ectively in order to develop medical applications that run securely over the World Wide Web...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a calculus that supports information- ow security policies and certi cate-based declassi cation. The decentralized label model and its downgrading mechanisms are concisely {{expressed in the}} polymorphic lambda calculus with subtyping (System F). We prove a conditioned version of the noninterference theorem such that authorization for declassi cation is justi ed by <b>digital</b> <b>certi</b> cates from public-key infrastructures. Note to the reviewers: An {{earlier version of this}} paper appears in European Symposium on Programming (ESOP), 2005. The main di erence is that the present version (1) contains detailed inference rules and proofs, and (2) formalizes noninterference with xpoints and divergence, (3) implements and typechecks a distributed bank example in the monadic style...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 52 - 57. From {{the point}} of its users, federated identity systems provide great convenience to log in to varied web sites without bothering of registration in advance. Looking from a vantage point, federated identity management gives the opportunity to users of one IT system to access data and sources of another IT system seamlessly and securely without handling a complete user administration. Single signon mechanisms manage user authentication process of these systems prompting log in once and assure access control across those multiple independent systems. OpenID is a widely used federated identity/single sign-on scheme generally implemented with username-password authentication. In this work, we augment the user authentication phase of OpenID with certi cate-based authentication using smartcard technology. Our solution provides a secure method to authenticate the user with user's <b>digital</b> <b>certi</b> cate written on the smartcard. Kişin, Bahar BernaM. S...|$|E

The e-commerce industry is still facing a range of problems concerning the process of completion of online transactions. Such problems are connected to consumer fears dealing with the identity of online merchants, their security pre- cautions and methods for accepting online payments. This thesis develops and presents a Mutual Authentication Model (MAM), which addresses the problem of mutual authentication between online shoppers and merchants. The model combines existing technologies in the eld of cryp- tography, {{as well as the}} use of digital signatures and certi cates. This is done in a speci c manner as for the model to achieve mutual authentication between communicating parties, in an online transactions. The Mutual Authentication Model provides a process through which an online shopper can be quickly and transparently equipped with a digital identi cation, {{in the form of a}} <b>digital</b> <b>certi</b> cate of high trust, in order for this shopper to participate in an authen- ticated transaction within the MAM. A few of the advantages of the developed model include the prospect of decreased online credit fraud, as well as an increased rate of completed online transactions. Prof. S. H. von Solm...|$|E
40|$|Information {{security}} threats to organisations have changed immensely {{over the last}} decade, due to the complexity and dynamic nature of infrastructure and attacks. Successful attacks cost society billions a year, impacting vital services and the economy. Examples include StuxNet, in which infected USB sticks were used to sabotage nuclear plants, and the DigiNotar attack, in which fake <b>digital</b> <b>certi</b> cates were used to spy on website traf c. New attacks cleverly exploit multiple organisational vulnerabilities, involving physical security and human behaviour. Defenders need to make rapid decisions regarding which attacks to block, as both infrastructure and attacker knowledge change rapidly. Current risk management methods provide descriptive tools for assessing threats by systematic brainstorming. Attack opportunities will be identified and prevented only if people can envisage them. In today’s dynamic attack landscape, this process is too slow and exceeds the limits of human imaginative capability. Emerging security risks demand tool support to predict, prioritise, and prevent complex attacks systematically. The TREsPASS project has developed methods and tools to analyse and visualise information security risks in dynamic organisations, as well as possible countermeasures. An Attack Navigator has been built to help security practitioners model which attack opportunities are possible and most pressing, and which countermeasures are most effective. To this end, the project combines knowledge from technical sciences (to identify the vulnerabilities of technological networks), social sciences (to identify the vulnerabilities of social networks), and state-of-the-art industry processes and tools, such as The Open Group’s ArchiMate modelling language. The TREsPASS project included a work stream to explore the visualisation of cyber security risk. The goal of this work stream was to extend {{the state of the}} art in cyber security risk tools by developing visualisations that combine information visualisations with techniques from critical cartography and digital humanities to articulate different socio-technical dimensions of risk and provide tools through which to explore these dimensions. This work stream produced three types of visualistion: • Artistic visualisations, which articulate the cultural dimensions to security risks; • Journalistic visualisations, which articulate the relationships between risks and the data ows within an organisation and the workings of the risk model; and • Scientific visualisations, which contribute to the quantification of the qualitative risk data, articulate the attack and defence interaction (for which attack-defence trees are our start point) and enable the user to calculate risk from different perspectives and perform root cause analysis on risks to complex information flows. This book presents an overview of the outputs of this work stream...|$|E
