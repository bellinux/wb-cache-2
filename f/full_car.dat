50|$|Unfortunately {{the success}} of the <b>Fuller</b> <b>car</b> was short-lived. In 1908 a {{demonstration}} was held at the Nuckolls County Fair in which a <b>Fuller</b> <b>car</b> completed two laps of the fairgrounds racetrack in sixty seconds, averaging sixty miles per hour. The performance was so exceptional that a group of Omaha businessmen offered to buy the Angus Automobile Company. Charles Fuller wanted to accept the offer, but the other stockholders did not. The resulting dispute resulted in Fuller's decision to sever all ties with the company. Without his inventive ability and drive, the business did not long survive. Majority stock ownership of the company had early on been bought by residents of nearby Nelson. These stockholders decided in 1910 to move the company to Nelson, but no cars were produced after the move.|$|R

The townspeople were so impressed by the car and by Fuller's confidence that he could build a better car that they raised $50,000 by investing in $10 shares of the company's stock.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the term}} Compulsory Basic Training (abbreviated to CBT) is a {{preliminary}} vehicular training course {{which must be}} completed by people wishing to ride a motorcycle or moped unaccompanied on the road, and remains valid for 2 years upon completion.

If a <b>full</b> <b>car</b> licence was obtained before 1 February 2001 it is not necessary to complete a CBT course to ride a moped.|$|E

50|$|Whereas petits taxis {{are only}} for local city traffic, grands taxis are mostly used for city-to-city or -village transport. Normally a grand taxi is a shared vehicle: {{at the main}} taxi stands many grands taxis gather. It {{is a type of}} share taxi system but without {{timetables}} or government influence. Each taxi will drive a more or less fixed route to a set destination and all passengers looking for transport to that destination or somewhere along the route used share one grand taxi. When the taxi is full (maximum 4 passengers on the rear seat and two on the front-passenger chair) he will depart. He might depart earlier if it takes too long to wait for a <b>full</b> <b>car</b> and/or when he expects to pick up more passengers along the route.|$|E
50|$|A {{prospective}} driving examiner {{must have}} held a <b>full</b> <b>car</b> licence {{for more than}} four years with no more than three penalty points on it at the time of application. If the candidate is successful at the application form stage, he/she will be asked to take an online situational judgement test; if successful here, he/she will be invited for a Role Play Assessment at Cardington. If the candidate passes this, he/she will then be invited to take a extended driving test. The driving test involves a drive over a specially chosen route of about 20 to 25 miles. It will usually involve both urban and rural areas and will include driving on a dual carriageway and motorway (if within local area). Candidates are expected to drive at a speed consistent with the road and traffic conditions and without committing any serious faults.|$|E
50|$|Han Se-kyung is {{a person}} who tries her best in getting {{everything}} and lives by the motto of âSelf-achievement generated from hard workingâ. Though she studies design, because of her familyâs financial problem, she doesnât have the opportunity to study design abroad. And for this reason, not having any abroad studying experiences, she is often rejected by job interviewers. After three years, surprisingly, she is offered a job as a temporary worker at a clothes designing company called GN Fashion. She doesnât become a designer in the company; she becomes an errand girl for the head lady. When she is delivering some bags once, she bumps into Cha Seung-joâs car.
