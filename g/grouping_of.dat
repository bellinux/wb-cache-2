In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, and moved it to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> A.muscaria, rather than a distinct species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E
