This study systematically investigated chlorine/bromine <b>isotope</b> fractionation in EI-MS of HOCs including 12 organochlorines and 5 organobromines using GC-double focus magnetic-sector high resolution MS (GC-DFS-HRMS). Chlorine/bromine <b>isotope</b> fractionation behaviors of the HOCs in EI-MS showed varied <b>isotope</b> fractionation patterns and extents depending on compounds. Besides, <b>isotope</b> fractionation patterns and extents varied at different EI energies, demonstrating potential impacts of EI energy on the chlorine/bromine <b>isotope</b> fractionation. Hypotheses of inter-ion and intra-ion <b>isotope</b> fractionations were applied to interpreting the <b>isotope</b> fractionation behaviors. The inter-ion and intra-ion <b>isotope</b> fractionations counteractively contributed to the apparent <b>isotope</b> ratio for a certain dehalogenated product ion. The <b>isotope</b> fractionation mechanisms were tentatively elucidated on basis of the quasi-equilibrium theory. In {{the light of the}} findings of this study, <b>isotope</b> ratio evaluation scheme using complete molecular ions and the EI source with sufficient stable EI energies may be helpful to achieve optimal precision and accuracy of CSIA-Cl/Br data. The method and results of this study can help to predict <b>isotope</b> fractionation of HOCs during dehalogenation processes and further to reveal the dehalogenation pathways.

50|$|For the {{aforementioned}} nucleophilic substitution reactions, secondary hydrogen kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects at the α-carbon provide a direct means {{to distinguish between}} SN1 and SN2 reactions. It {{has been found that}} SN1 reactions typically lead to large secondary kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects, approaching to their theoretical maximum at about 1.22, while SN2 reactions typically yield kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects that are very close to or less than unity. Kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects that are greater than 1 are referred to as normal kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects, while kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects that are less than one are referred to as inverse kinetic <b>isotope</b> effects. In general, smaller force constants in the transition state are expected to yield a normal kinetic <b>isotope</b> effect, and larger force constants in the transition state are expected to yield an inverse kinetic <b>isotope</b> effect when stretching vibrational contributions dominate the kinetic <b>isotope</b> effect.|$|R
5|$|Bromine has two stable <b>isotopes,</b> 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural <b>isotopes,</b> with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine <b>isotopes</b> are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of <b>isotopes</b> lighter than 79Br is electron capture to <b>isotopes</b> of selenium; that of <b>isotopes</b> heavier than 81Br is beta decay to <b>isotopes</b> of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E
5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one stable isotope exists.

Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable <b>isotopes</b> observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable <b>isotopes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heavier <b>isotopes</b> of {{neptunium}} decay quickly, {{and lighter}} <b>isotopes</b> of neptunium cannot {{be produced by}} neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np. The short-lived heavier <b>isotopes</b> 238Np and 239Np, useful as radioactive tracers, are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter <b>isotopes</b> 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E
50|$|Owing to {{experimental}} uncertainties, {{measurement of}} <b>isotope</b> effect may entail significant uncertainty. Often <b>isotope</b> effects are determined through complementary studies {{on a series}} of isotopomers. Accordingly, it is quite useful to combine hydrogen <b>isotope</b> effects with heavy-atom <b>isotope</b> effects. For instance, determining nitrogen <b>isotope</b> effect along with hydrogen <b>isotope</b> effect was used to show that the reaction of 2-phenylethyltrimethylammonium ion with ethoxide in ethanol at 40oC follows an E2 mechanism, as opposed to alternative non-concerted mechanisms. This conclusion was reached upon showing that this reaction yields a nitrogen <b>isotope</b> effect, k14/k15, of 1.0133±0.0002 along with a hydrogen kinetic <b>isotope</b> effect of 3.2 at the leaving hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|Revelation of {{the effects}} of <b>isotope</b> {{fractionation}} during fragmentation in electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) on compound-specific <b>isotope</b> analysis of chlorine and bromine (CSIA-Cl/Br) may be of crucial significance, yet a theoretical basis for elucidating the effects is absent. This study provides a solid theoretical deduction regarding the <b>isotope</b> fractionation taking place during fragmentation in EI-MS. Both intermolecular and intramolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionations present in dehalogenation processes, influencing the <b>isotope</b> ratios of detected ions. In general, intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation positively affects the <b>isotope</b> ratios of precursor ions but inversely impacts those of the corresponding product ions. Molecular ions are normally affected by one type of intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation only during the dehalogenation from parent ions to their product ions. While product ions can be impacted by two types of intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionations, namely, the inverse intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation from parent ions to their product ions and the normal intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation from the product ions to their further dehalogenated product ions. For a compound having position-distinct <b>isotope</b> ratios, if dehalogenation reacts on only one position, the intermolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation taking palace in this reaction is normal for the detected precursor ion, but ineffective to the product ion <b>isotope</b> ratio in comparison with that of the total precursor ions. On the other hand, intramolecular <b>isotope</b> fractionation positively affects the <b>isotope</b> ratios of product ions only. The chlorine isotopologues of the observed precursor ions are deduced to never obey binomial distribution, regardless of what modes of the initial isotopologue distributions of the total precursor ions are.

40|$|Hydrogen {{and carbon}} <b>isotope</b> ratios of {{cellulose}} nitrate and oxygen <b>isotope</b> ratios of cellulose from C 3, C 4, and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants were determined for plants growing within {{a small area}} in Val Verde County, Texas. Plants having CAM had distinctly higher deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios than plants having C 3 and C 4 metabolism. When hydrogen <b>isotope</b> ratios are plotted against carbon <b>isotope</b> ratios, each photosynthetic mode separates into a distinct cluster of points. C 4 plants had many D/H ratios {{similar to those of}} C 3 plants, so that hydrogen <b>isotope</b> ratios cannot be used to distinguish between these two photosynthetic modes. Portulaca mundula, which may have a modified photosynthetic mode between C 4 and CAM, had a hydrogen <b>isotope</b> ratio between those of the C 4 and CAM plants. When oxygen <b>isotope</b> ratios are plotted against carbon <b>isotope</b> ratios, no distinct clustering of the C 4 and CAM plants occurs. Thus, oxygen <b>isotope</b> ratios are not useful in distinguishing between these metabolic modes. A plot of hydrogen <b>isotope</b> ratios versus oxygen <b>isotope</b> ratios for this sample set shows considerable overlap between oxygen <b>isotope</b> ratios of the different photosynthetic modes without a concomitant overlap in the hydrogen <b>isotope</b> ratios of CAM and the other two photosynthetic modes.
