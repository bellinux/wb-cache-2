500|$|Lauren {{is portrayed}} by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest {{appearances}} throughout the first season, {{and became a}} member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode [...] "Special Education". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, [...] "I didn't quite believe it at first, I thought I was getting Punk'd." [...] She said that being cast in Glee makes <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the luckiest girl in the world". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, [...] "In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it’s just so inspirational." [...] When asked about her casting process, Fink said: ...|$|E
500|$|Rihanna's voice spans one-and-a-half octaves in [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", from F3 to C5, and her vocal has a [...] "silky", [...] "seductive" [...] tone. In the song's lyrics Rihanna yearns for her lover's attention, {{which makes}} <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{the only girl}} in the world. The singer [...] "pours her heart out" [...] in the chorus: [...] "Want you {{to make me feel}} like I'm the only girl in the world/ Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love/ Like I'm the only one who knows your heart/ Only girl in the world." [...] According to Digital Spy writer Nick Levine, the chorus [...] "thumps like a rabbit having an epileptic fit." [...] Rihanna sings suggestively, [...] "Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'/ You can come inside/ And when you enter, you ain't leavin'/ Be my {{prisoner}} for the night." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC compared the song's message to that of the German fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel"; Rihanna is not willing to throw her hair out of the castle for just any man to come and satisfy her, [...] "particularly not someone who isn't prepared to make the climb up to her scarily high window." ...|$|E
500|$|During the season, the {{producers}} worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios {{to help create}} Raina's Inhuman look, and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU. To get to the final look, the writers {{spent a lot of}} time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film Nightbreed, specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because [...] "She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to [...] "make <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the first real Inhuman" [...] and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, {{the producers}} wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, [...] "Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg {{examine how}} Larsen’s {{characters}} struggle against {{race and gender}} norms of [...] "whiteness" [...] in the United States. Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture. Clare, who is of mixed race, choses {{to identify with the}} white culture. Irene, who identifies as an African American, choses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture. The essence of Rottenberg's scholarship shows how the novel's characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around [...] "white" [...] identity. Clare's experience growing up with her white aunts, who treated her as a servant, directly impacts Clare's initial desire towards whiteness. Hence, she passes as a white woman, marries a white man, and forgets her African American culture. Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race, Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white. [...] For example, Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power, but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene, she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her African American identification. Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her African American culture. Similarly, Irene identifies as black, but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life , she chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene's desire to be white comes from her wanting the middle-class lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation, which in a way, makes <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> her marriage and the life she knows at risk. Throughout Larsen's novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the African American culture, while Irene still has a desire to achieve [...] "whiteness" [...] for the feel secure.|$|E

Later in the episode, when Sharona follows the killer they've been after, police captain Stottlemeyer snaps at Monk, [...] "Who does Sharona think she is?" [...] Monk answers sheepishly, [...] "Lois Lane." ...|$|E

When Carol was touched by the desire for heroism in Raymie and tried tactfully to express it, Vida made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an impertinent child.|$|E

60|$|He {{sat down}} and waited. Mrs. Jackson felt unaccountably nervous; it had never {{occurred}} to her that a mere soldier could be so hard to deal with, and it was she who hesitated now. Jamie's stern eyes made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> singularly <b>like</b> a culprit; but she cleared her throat and straightened herself.|$|R
60|$|Even out of {{this mass}} of clerklings emerged two or three who were interesting: Sam Weintraub, a young, active, red-headed, slim-waisted Jew, {{who was born in}} Brooklyn. He smoked large cigars with an air, knew how to wear his clothes, and told about playing tennis at the Prospect Athletic Club. He would be a smart {{secretary}} or confidential clerk some day, Una was certain; he would own a car and be seen in evening clothes and even larger cigars at after-theater suppers. She was rather in awe of his sophistication. He was the only man who made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a Freshman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{said the}} girl, knowing at this the deepest thrill {{she had ever}} felt. It came to her there, with her eyes on his face, that she held {{the whole thing in}} her hand, held it as she held her pencil, which might have broken at that instant in her {{tightened}} grip. This made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the very fountain of fate, but the emotion was such a flood that she had to press it back with all her force. That was positively the reason, again, of her flute-like Paddington tone. [...] "You can't give us anything a little nearer?" [...] Her [...] "little" [...] and her [...] "us" [...] came straight from Paddington. These things were no false note for him--his difficulty absorbed them all. The eyes with which he pressed her, and in the depths of which she read terror and rage and literal tears, were just the same he would have shown any other prim person.|$|E
6000|$|The {{only person}} who took no {{interest}} in the [...] "Traveller's Joy [...] " [...] was Janet, who could not think how reasonable people could endure such nonsense. Her first affront had been taken at a most absurd description which Jock had illustrated by a fancy caricature of [...] "The Fox and the Crow," [...] "Woman's Progress," [...] in which [...] "Mr. Hermann Dowsterswivel" [...] was represented as haranguing by turns with her on the steamer, and, during her discourse, quietly secreting her bag. It was such wild fun that Lord Fordham never dreamt of its being an affront, nor perhaps would it have been, if Dr. Medlicott would have chopped logic, science, and philosophy with her in the way she thought her due from the only man who could be supposed to approach her in intellect. He however took to chaff. He would defend every popular error that she attacked, and with an acumen and ease that baffled her, even when she knew he was not in earnest, and made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> Thor, when the giant affected to take three blows with Miolner for three flaps of a rat's tail.|$|E
50|$|Jun's {{feelings}} about sex are also relatively straightforward. While she enjoys the pleasure it brings and the mood it sets, she enjoys {{the fact that}} she can have the control of making someone else <b>feel</b> more good. <b>Her</b> first sexual encounter also made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> an artist than anything else to that point.|$|R

6000|$|With Ellen, Lottie now {{considered}} herself quits, {{and from the}} first hour of Ellen's happiness she threw off all the care with all the apparent kindness which she had used towards {{her when she was}} a morbid invalid. Here again, if Lottie had minded such a thing, she might have been as much vexed by Ellen's attitude as by Breckon's. Ellen never once noticed the withdrawal of her anxious oversight, or seemed in the least to miss it. As much as her meek nature would allow, she arrogated to herself the privileges and prerogatives of an elder sister, and if it had been possible to make Lottie ever feel like a chit, there were moments when Ellen's behavior would have made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a chit. It was not till after their return to Tuskingum that Lottie took her true place in relation to the affair, and in the preparations for the wedding, which she appointed to be in the First Universalist Church, overruling both her mother's and sister's preferences for a home wedding, that Lottie rose in due authority. Mrs. Kenton had not ceased to feel quelled whenever her younger daughter called her mother instead of momma, and Ellen seemed not really to care. She submitted the matter to Breckon, who said, [...] "Oh yes, if Lottie wishes," [...] and he laughed when Ellen confessed, [...] "Well, I said we would." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{these things}} were {{happening}} at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, {{and for the first}} time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children, though she didn't think it proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made. Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a fly in the web of a very strict spider.|$|E
6000|$|She was a cook, I {{can tell}} you! And {{after we got}} ahead, [...] And she could 'a' had a girl to do the cookin' instead, [...] I had the {{greatest}} time to get Momma to leave the work; [...] She said it made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a mis'able sneak and shirk. [...] She didn't want daughter, though, when we did begin to keep girls, [...] To come {{in the kitchen and}} cook, and smell up her clo'es and curls; [...] But you couldn't have stopped the child, whatever you tried to do-- [...] I reckon the gift of the cookin' was born in Girly, too. [...] Cook she would from the first, and we just had to let her alone; [...] And after she got married, and had a house of her own, [...] She tried to make me feel, when I come to live with her, [...] Like it was my house, too; and I tell you she done it, sir! [...] She remembered that breakfast was my best meal, and she tried [...] To have all I used to have, and a good deal more beside; [...] Grape-fruit to begin with, or melons or peaches, at least-- [...] Husband's business took him there, and they had went to live East-- [...] Then a Spanish macker'l, or a soft-shell crab on toast, [...] Or a broiled live lobster! Well, sir, I don't want to seem to boast, [...] But I don't believe you could have got in the whole of New York [...] Any such an oyster fry or sausage of country pork.|$|E
60|$|There, Lady Mildred Mant, {{linked to}} Mrs. Jack Hale, of the {{collateral}} {{branch of the}} family, was saying things about her father in his capacity of host and entertainer, that were making <b>her</b> companion <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> another woman. Farther on, stopping occasionally to gesticulate, could be seen other Emsworth relations and connections. It was a typical scene of quiet, peaceful English family life.|$|R

5000|$|Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a B+, saying, [...] "The hour finale {{was a strange}} ride, {{marvelous}} in some ways, confounding in others. Endings are difficult, and I don’t think any objective assessment would say they nailed this one." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more blunt in saying that [...] "Bays and Thomas simply looked like shitty long-term planners, unable to understand that getting the audience so invested in the Barney and Robin coupling or in Tracy as a character would {{make it all the}} harder when the series finale abruptly dissolved the former and treated the latter’s death as an aside in the narration. That the show never seemed to suggest Ted mourned <b>her</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> a vital betrayal of his character." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fleda had fully recognized, {{the first}} days, that, {{quite apart from}} any {{question}} of letting Owen know where she was, {{it would be a}} charity to give him some sign: it would be weak, it would be ugly, to be diverted from that kindness by the fact that Mrs. Gereth had attached a tinkling bell to it. A frank relation with him was only superficially discredited: she ought for his own sake to send him a word of cheer. So she repeatedly reasoned, but she as repeatedly delayed performance: if her general plan had been to be as still as a mouse, an interview like the interview at Ricks would be an odd contribution to that ideal. Therefore with a confused preference of practice to theory she let the days go by; she felt that nothing was so imperative as the gain of precious time. She shouldn't be able to stay with her father forever, but she might now reap the benefit of having married her sister. Maggie's union had been built up round a small spare room. Concealed in this apartment she might try to paint again, and abetted by the grateful Maggie--for Maggie at least was grateful--she might try to dispose of her work. She had not indeed struggled with a brush since her visit to Waterbath, where the sight of the family splotches had put her immensely on her guard. Poynton moreover had been an impossible place for producing; no active art could flourish there but a Buddhistic contemplation. It had stripped its mistress clean of all feeble accomplishments; her hands were imbrued neither with ink nor with water-color. Close to Fleda's present abode was the little shop of a man who mounted and framed pictures and desolately dealt in artists' materials. She sometimes paused before it to look at a couple of shy experiments for which its dull window constituted publicity, small studies placed there for sale and full of warning to a young lady without fortune and without talent. Some such young lady had brought them forth in sorrow; some such young lady, to see if they had been snapped up, had passed and repassed as helplessly as she herself was doing. They never had been, they never would be, snapped up; yet they were quite above the actual attainment of some other young ladies. It was a matter of discipline with Fleda to take an occasional lesson from them; besides which, when she now quitted the house, she had to look for reasons after she was out. The only place to find them was in the shop-windows. They made <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a servant-girl taking her [...] "afternoon," [...] but that didn't signify: perhaps some day she would resemble such a person still more closely. This continued a fortnight, {{at the end of which}} the feeling was suddenly dissipated. She had stopped as usual in the presence of the little pictures; then, as she turned away, she had found herself face to face with Owen Gereth.|$|E
