More discussion of methodologies and <b>data</b> <b>compatibility,</b> and a more complete reference list, would have been useful. It will make a fine introductory text for courses in African history, especially if supplemented by books and papers that reflect other research methods and their results.” [...] Ehret’s linguistic tome, Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Proto-Afrasian): Vowels, Tone, Consonants, and Vocabulary (1995), {{is the subject of}} a detailed review article in Afrika und Übersee by the distinguished scholar of Afroasiatic languages, Ekkehard Wolff. Wolff writes: “Ehrets opus magnum ist ein Parforce-Ritt durch schwierigstes Terrain, bei dem sich der Reiter auch an die steilsten Hindernissen überraschend gut in Sattel hält und an nur einer einzigen Hürde nach Meinung des Rez. scheitert (…Tonalität). Es ist ein nahezu unmöglisches, ein sehr mutiges und ein möglicherweise epochales Buch.” (“Ehret’s opus magnum is a steeplechase ride through the most difficult terrain, in which the rider stays in the saddle astonishingly well even at the steepest obstacles and, in the opinion of the reviewer, crashes at only a single hurdle (…tone).

40|$|A {{model of}} the missile s {{aerodynamic}} has been developed by Kongsberg DefenseSystems (KDS) based on information from CFD analysis and wind tunnel tests. It isdesirable to supplement the existing model by using data from actual missile flights inorder to improve the model validity. A system identification scheme based on actualflight data involves test flights, <b>data</b> <b>compatibility</b> analysis, model identification andverification. <b>Data</b> <b>compatibility</b> analysis, which is the main focus for this thesis,concerns the determination of systematic errors in the measurements. The purposeof this thesis is to investigate methods for a <b>data</b> <b>compatibility</b> analysis scheme for alaser guided missile.

40|$|The small {{laboratory}} {{computer is}} ideal for experimental control and data acquisition. Postexperimental data processing is often performed on large computers because {{of the availability of}} sophisticated programs, but costs and <b>data</b> <b>compatibility</b> are negative factors. Parameter optimization can be accomplished on the small computer, offering ease of programming, <b>data</b> <b>compatibility,</b> and low cost. A previously proposed random-search algorithm ('random creep') was found to be very slow in convergence. A method is proposed (the 'random leap' algorithm) which starts in a global search mode and automatically adjusts step size to speed convergence. A FORTRAN executive program for the random-leap algorithm is presented which calls a user-supplied function subroutine. An example of a function subroutine is given which calculates maximum-likelihood estimates of receiver operating-characteristic parameters from binary response data. Other applications in parameter estimation, generalized least squares, and matrix inversion are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>data</b> <b>compatibility</b> issues {{arising from}} the {{assessment}} of remnant native vegetation condition using satellite remote sensing and field-based data. Space-borne passive remote sensing is increasingly used {{as a way of}} providing a total sample and synoptic overview of the spectral and spatial characteristics of native vegetation canopies at a regional scale. However, integrating field-collected data often not designed for integration with remotely sensed data can lead to <b>data</b> <b>compatibility</b> issues. Subsequent problems associated with the integration of unsuited datasets can contribute to data uncertainty and result in inconclusive findings. It is these types of problems (and potential solutions) that form the basis of this paper. In other words, how can field surveys be designed to support and improve compatibility with remotely sensed total surveys? Key criteria were identified for consideration when designing field-based surveys of native vegetation condition (and other similar applications) with the intent to incorporate remotely sensed data. The criteria include recommendations for the siting of plots, the need for reference location plots, the number of sample sites and plot size and distribution, within a study area. The difficulties associated with successfully integrating these data are illustrated using real examples taken from a study of the vegetation in the Little River Catchment, New South Wales, Australia...|$|E
