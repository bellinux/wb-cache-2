40|$|The {{activity}} {{of a commercial}} NiMo hydrotreating catalyst was investigated to convert <b>distilled</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (DTO), a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry, into feedstocks {{for the production of}} base chemicals with reduced oxygen content. The experiments were conducted in a fixed bed continuous flow reactor covering a wide temperature range (325 - 450 degrees C). Hydrotreating of DTO resulted in the formation of a hydrocarbon fraction consisting of up to similar to 50 wt % nC(17) +C- 18 paraffins. Comprehensive 2 D GC and GC-MS analysis shows that the resin acids in DTO are converted at temperatures above 400 degrees C to cycloalkanes and aromatics. However, at these temperatures the yield of nC(17) +C- 18 hydrocarbons irrespective of space time is drastically reduced because of cracking reactions that produce aromatics. The commercial NiMo catalyst was not deactivated during extended on-stream tests of more than 30 h. Modeling the steam cracking of the highly paraffinic liquid obtained during hydrotreatment of DTO at different process conditions indicates high ethylene yields (> 32 wt %) ...|$|E
40|$|Development {{of new and}} {{innovative}} products through efficient technologies {{is essential for the}} implementation of sustainable developments in highly competitive chemical industries. Based on this context, raw materials originating from biomass have been widely used for the production of chemicals and materials. Steam cracking of bio-based or renewable feedstocks in a conventional steam cracking set-up is identified as a promising approach for the sustainable production of base-chemicals. In a two-step process for the production of base-chemicals, firstly, bio-derived feedstock is upgraded into a more suitable feedstock which comprises mainly paraffin range hydrocarbons with a lower oxygen content than the original feedstock; secondly, the upgraded feedstock is converted into base-chemicals by conventional steam cracking technology. This research work identifies wood-derived tall oil as a potential feedstock for the production of base-chemicals by catalytic upgrading and steam cracking methods. The main aim of this work was to carry out the catalytic hydrotreating of tall oil feedstocks such as tall oil fatty acid (TOFA), <b>distilled</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (DTO) and crude tall oil (CTO) on a commercial, sulfided NiMo catalyst at different process conditions. The effects of space time and process temperatures on the distribution of products from the hydrotreatment of different tall oil feeds were investigated. Hydrotreating chemistry of oxygenates in tall oil were assessed based on the achieved conversion of reactants and product distribution under the investigated conditions. Furthermore, the steam cracking of hydrodeoxygented tall oil (HDO-tall oil) feeds was carried out, and evaluation of the yield of olefins in comparison with conventional steam cracking feeds such as naphtha and natural gas condensate (NGC) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the use of {{reclaimed}} asphalt pavement (RAP) has been growing consistently from 15 % in 2009 to 20. 3 % in 2015. The desire to use higher amounts of RAP is inspired {{by the need to}} lower costs, conserve energy, and preserve the environment. Increasing asphalt prices, and limited supply of higher quality virgin aggregates, are strong motivations to use RAP as a replacement for the more expensive virgin asphalt and aggregates. The main obstacle from using higher amounts of RAP is the aged and deteriorated properties of the RAP binder. With aging, asphalt binders suffer from oxidation which results in the conversion of part of the maltenes fraction to asphaltenes. Asphaltenes are primarily responsible for increasing the asphalt stiffness. The use of rejuvenators help restore the balance between the asphaltenes and maltenes, by adding more maltenes and/or improving the dispersion of asphaltenes. Current rejuvenators that are available in the market are based on several materials including petroleum-based aromatic extracts, <b>distilled</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil,</b> and other natural oils (i. e., organic oils). Bio-based rejuvenators have proven to be a better and safer alternative to petroleum-based rejuvenators containing aromatic compounds. This research introduces a soybean-derived rejuvenator which is used to enhance the low temperature and fatigue properties of asphalt binders. During {{the first phase of the}} research, the effect of the rejuvenator is assessed by blending it with a neat PG 58 - 28 and a polymer modified PG 64 - 28 binders. Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) tests are conducted to characterize the rheological properties of the rejuvenated binders. Temperature-frequency sweeps are conducted and complex shear modulus curves are constructed to compare between the control and the rejuvenated binders. Dynamic modulus specimens are made using the rejuvenated PG 58 - 28 and PG 64 - 28 binders. The impact of the rejuvenator on both the dynamic modulus and phase angles is studied using master curves. A comprehensive statistical analysis using split-plot repeated measures (SPRM) is conducted to reveal statistical differences between the performance of the rejuvenator in both types of binders. The preliminary results indicate that the soybean-derived rejuvenator was successful at lowering both the high and low critical temperatures of both types of binders. The statistical analysis revealed that the extent of modification brought about by the rejuvenator was dependent on the binder type. The results of the dynamic modulus testing showed a consistent reduction in the dynamic modulus values and an increase in the phase angles with the use of the rejuvenator. A Fourier-transform Infrared study (FTIR) performed on the rejuvenated binders indicated that their aging behavior was similar to that of the control binders, indicating that the rejuvenator did not adversely impact the durability of the binders. In the second phase of this research, a rejuvenated PG 58 - 28 binders was blended with an extracted reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) binder. The fatigue behavior of the rejuvenated RAP binder is evaluated using linear amplitude sweep (LAS) testing. A significant increase in the fatigue life, particularly at low temperatures and increasing shear rate, is noted with the use of the rejuvenator. The rejuvenator was successful in lowering the performance grade of the stiff aged RAP binder to acceptable ranges. 100 % RAP mixtures made and compacted into dynamic modulus and disk-compact tension (DCT) specimens were made using the neat PG 58 - 28 and rejuvenated PG 58 - 28 binders. The DCT specimens containing the rejuvenator showed higher fracture energy at a test temperature of - 6 oC which indicates better thermal cracking resistance. To assess the effect of blending efficiency, additional DCT specimens were prepared using extracted RAP binder blended with the rejuvenated PG 58 - 28 binder. The RAP/rejuvenated PG 58 - 28 blend was then remixed with the extracted RAP aggregate to simulate full blending. The DCT specimens prepared as such yielded even higher fracture energies indicating the significance of proper blending. The thermal stability of the rejuvenated RAP binder was verified using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The mass loss due to thermal decomposition of the rejuvenated RAP binder was similar to that of the control binder. A study of the evolved gases using FTIR showed that the rate of mass loss of the rejuvenator can be inferred by comparing the FTIR spectra at different times...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Moisture content {{control is}} a very {{effective}} way of protecting timber. Treatments with environment-friendly, biodegradable <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> are known to reduce the capillary water uptake of pine sapwood greatly, but despite the good results achieved {{there have been two}} problems that limit the use of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> for wood protection, the large amount of oil needed and the tendency for the oil to exude from the wood. This work was undertaken in order to obtain an understanding of the mechanism of wood protection by means of crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO) and to find technical solutions to the main problems limiting its use for industrial wood protection. It is shown that the emulsion technique is one way of solving the first problem, as it provides high water-repellent efficiency at considerably lower oil retention levels. The fact that water is used as a thinner in this technique instead of the commonly used organic solvents is beneficial from environmental, economic and safety points of view. It is also shown that although the drying properties of CTO are inadequate for use as such in wood preservation, its oxidation and polymerization can be accelerated considerably by means of iron catalysts, which prevent the oil from exuding out of the wood. This also increases the water repellent efficiency of CTO treatment. Most impregnation oils do not dry when applied in large quantities, because they hinder the diffusion of air through the wood, which supplies the necessary oxygen. Limiting of the oil uptake by the means of the emulsion technique disturbs the airflow to a lesser extent, and thus enhances the drying process. Hence, both the emulsion technique and the use of an iron catalyst improve both the water-repellent efficiency of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> treatment and the rate of drying of the oil, thus solving the two main problems related to wood impregnation with <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> in one single-stage treatment which can be used in existing wood preservation plants.
