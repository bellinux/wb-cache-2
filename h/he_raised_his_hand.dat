2500|$|A {{few moments}} of {{hesitation}} and then Symes sprang to attention and as <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in formal salute: [...] "Damn the British Resident, Sir." ...|$|E
2500|$|Underarm bowling was {{effective}} while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. [...] In time, {{especially after the}} opening of Lord's {{and the development of}} groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than formerly. [...] In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. [...] Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his hand away from his body. [...] It is not clear how high <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{but it could have been}} waist height. [...] He was accused of [...] "jerking" [...] the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. [...] He was suitably censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution.|$|E
60|$|The next word failed on his lips; <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in {{the dead}} silence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and pointed over Miss Garth's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Selingman came {{a little}} further into the room. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> above <b>his</b> head; his voice was thick with horror.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the door}} opened and Julia appeared, {{followed}} by two veiled figures. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to bless her, then checked himself.|$|R
5000|$|As his {{students}} sang the lines [...] "Meena lochani pasa mochani" [...] <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and saying [...] "Sive Pahi" [...] {{and left his}} mortal coil.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as before, and, {{with the}} outstretched fingers, {{repeated}} the blessing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and they}} {{saw that he was}} holding a small revolver.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to point. Instantly the {{revolver}} was against his waistcoat, making an unwelcome crease in that immaculate garment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Especially as we {{have just}} conquered her and put her to flight," [...] added the Pumpkinhead, as <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to turn <b>his</b> face toward the Scarecrow.|$|R
60|$|The {{minister}} {{stood in}} silence for a moment; then setting his lanthorn upon the table, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and eyes towards the low ceiling of the chamber.|$|R
60|$|Razumov had {{foreseen}} {{that such}} a question would certainly come to meet him sooner or later. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> a little and let them fall helplessly by his side--nothing more.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{quickly to}} his forehead, {{as though in}} pain. It was gone in an instant, {{but she had been}} watching.|$|E
60|$|A {{flock of}} sea-birds flew {{screaming}} over their heads, and he {{waited a moment}} until they should have passed. Then <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{when she}} was within a sword's length of him, and with startling words, {{delivered}} in ringing tones, he broke the ponderous silence.|$|E
60|$|It was Job Haskers {{who called}} {{out in this}} fashion, as <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> high in the air. He was seized with a chill, and shook from head to foot.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> forehead--his silk hat was on {{the table}} rim upwards; he had put it there with a despairing gesture as <b>he</b> came in--he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> forehead. [...] "It seems to me unfair. I--" [...] He broke off again. Anthony looked at Flora who stood by the side of her father.|$|R
25|$|Superman ending: This {{is similar}} to the first, but as Goldman bids {{farewell}} to the narrator, <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and rises into the sky. This ending is achieved by typing untruthful answers to questions asked in the boss fight.|$|R
60|$|Starting {{up on his}} knees, he {{uttered a}} wild shriek. Then, as the truth entered his soul, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and gave a faint cheer.|$|E
60|$|Reinhart shrugged. He {{stepped up}} to the door. Holding his gun level <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> passing {{it in front of the}} eye circuit. Nothing happened.|$|E
60|$|Would {{the beast}} spring down upon him? That was the {{question}} Shep asked himself. As quickly as he could <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> which contained his jack-knife.|$|E
5000|$|Suraqa {{felt uncomfortable}} {{in the royal}} outfit. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> towards the sky and prayed: â€˜O my Lord, how could I put on {{something}} which your Prophet deserved far more than I? I smell the air of punishment in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The sudden {{light of}} joy that shone in Tom's face as <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to heaven, <b>his</b> {{emphatic}} [...] "Bless the Lord!" [...] rather discomposed St. Clare; {{he did not}} like it that Tom should be so ready to leave him.|$|R
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} have turned him to stone. He dropped her fingers {{as though they were}} burning him. A vacant light eclipsed the passion which had shone a moment before in <b>his</b> eyes. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to the sky in a despairing gesture.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} he was {{shivering}} with cold; and every time <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to the knocker, the wind took the dressing-gown in a most unpleasant manner.|$|E
60|$|Laverick, {{strong man}} though he was, was {{conscious}} of a sudden weakness. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his forehead and drew it away--wet. He struggled desperately for self-control.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his cap {{and turned}} away. The mate, who had just come on deck, stared after the {{retreating}} couple and gave vent to a low whistle.|$|E
60|$|The Knight {{shook his}} head. 'It was {{all kinds of}} {{fastness}} with me, I can assure you!' <b>he</b> said. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch.|$|R
6000|$|... "At first {{everybody}} {{thought it was}} going far outside the ground. But soon they saw that all the giant's strength had been wasted in hitting the ball so high, and that there was a chance that it would fall within the ropes. The batsmen had run three runs and it was still in the air. Then it was seen that an English fielder was standing on {{the very edge of the}} field with his back on the ropes, a white figure against the black line of the people. He stood watching the mighty curve of the ball, and twice <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> together above <b>his</b> head as he did so. Then a third time <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> above <b>his</b> head, and the ball was in them and Bonner was out." ...|$|R
6000|$|MORELL (taking the cue with a debater's adroitness). Dancing {{before all}} the people, Candida; and {{thinking}} he was moving their hearts by his mission when they were only suffering from--Prossy's complaint. (She is about to protest: <b>he</b> <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to silence her, exclaiming) Don't try to look indignant, Candida:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Here the orator bowed, {{and took}} {{advantage}} of the applause to replenish his stock of breath. When his face had begun to lose the purple tinge, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Smith took up {{the pistol}} and he looked towards Bellingham with an inexorable face. As the {{second-hand}} stole round, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and the finger twitched upon the trigger.|$|E
6000|$|Pete nodded. [...] "I ken! When ye feel ye must do a thing, it's {{better just}} {{to do it and}} think afterwards." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "She's stopping!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{and took}} her face, which he drew so close to his own that, as she gently let him, he could kiss her with solemnity on the forehead. [...] "Come!" [...] he then very firmly said--quite indeed {{as if it were}} a {{question}} of their moving on the spot.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> companion's <b>hand</b> to <b>his</b> {{lips and}} drew her arm through his.|$|R
60|$|Joy {{shone in}} Uncle Tom's face. 'Bless the Lord,' <b>he</b> said, <b>raising</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to heaven.|$|R
