40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between Komsomol and <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> under Perestroika. Perestroika brought immense social change to Soviet society. Komsomol had to face, {{for the first time in}} its long history, rival <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> not subordinate to, but independent of its power. An investigation of this new situation and analysis of the transformation of formal organizations like Komsomol sheds light on the transition and social change experienced during the final days of the Soviet system. First, this paper will examine the appearance of various <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> under Perestroika, ranging from amateur hobby clubs to political groups. Simultaneously it will explore the tactics used by Komsomol to compete with them for support among young people and to survive in the new situation. This discussion will include an examination of the roles played by Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> during Perestroika. This paper {{focuses on the}} period from the 20 th Komsomol Congress held in April, 1987 until June, 1988, when there were heated demands for democratization at the 19 th Party Conference. It was in this period that the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> not only played the most important role in promoting social change, but Komsomol also devised strategies to revive its role as a youth organization. As background, we will trace the history of the relations between Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations.</b> At first, Komsomol had to take young people from traditional youth organizations in order to become the only formal youth organization in the Soviet system. Although Komsomol acquired this status in the late 1920 s, there was an ongoing struggle to retain this monopoly in the face of continual attempts to create <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations.</b> In the 1970 s, <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> of youth, mostly hobby clubs like rock music clubs became an essential part of life for ordinary young people. They enjoyed their leisure time in a subculture beyond the influence of Komsomol. These organizations were not directly anti-Soviet nor even politically oriented. Nevertheless, they were threatening to the authorities as potential enemies because they were making Soviet ideology less influential among the youth, the future-builders of Soviet society. The renewed Cold War that broke out at the beginning of the 1980 s made Komsomol confront a hard situation: how to protect Soviet youth from the evil subculture of the West. Under these circumstances, Komsomol adopted a new policy for <b>informal</b> <b>organizations.</b> That is, instead of suppressing all of them, Komsomol began to select "better" organizations both to promote and to keep under control the leisure activities of Soviet youth. Second, this paper will examine this new Komsomol policy toward <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations.</b> After Perestroika began, as society became more and more active, ideological restrictions rapidly weakened. Komsomol decided to "register" the informal youth hobby clubs and permit them to operate freely under its supervision. This new approach greatly increased the possibility both for cooperation and friction between Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations.</b> In addition, new organizations appeared such as those protecting cultural assets or others promoting ecological awareness. Further, youth groups involved in political discussions gradually emerged. These new organizations were considered the pioneers of Perestroika and were starting to rival Komsomol. The 20 th Komsomol Congress was the first opportunity to discuss the relationship between Komsomol and the emerging <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations.</b> At this Congress, Komsomol declared that they could not become an alternative to Komsomol. It also tried to transform itself into a political organization to represent youth interests. Third, this paper analyzes the politicization of the <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> in the spring just before the 19 th Party Conference. At last, Komsomol recognized that it could not avoid talking on equal terms with the <b>informal</b> political <b>organizations</b> concerning the future of all youth organizations, including Komsomol itself. The <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> and Komsomol delegates met several times to discuss political problems in general and to make a joint appeal to the 19 th Conference. The 19 th Conference was a very important venue for Komsomol to insure its role and status in the emerging system. After the discussions with the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations,</b> Komsomol devised a new strategy: It would become one of many youth organizations and it would cooperate with the others to advance Perestroika. Komsomol abandoned its earlier strategy of maintaining a monopoly over youth organizations. It realized that it could survive only if it became reconciled with the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> that were more popular and more influential among the youth. To improve its image and survive, Komsomol would have to work in partnership with the other groups. After the 20 th Congress, a partnership was gradually established between Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> in the area of leisure and cultural activities because such cooperation would serve to make Komsomol more popular. Ironically however, Komsomol was losing its organizational unity and identity as a youth organization due to its success in constructing a cooperative relationship with the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations.</b> In addition, after the 19 th Conference, the search for a political partnership between Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations</b> became more difficult. Under Perestroika, Komsomol had to transform itself in order to compete with the <b>informal</b> <b>organizations.</b> This transformation process and the evolving relationship between Komsomol and the <b>informal</b> youth <b>organizations</b> are ongoing. They are a topic for future research on the role of Komsomol under Perestroika...|$|R

60|$|Trafford {{brought his}} mind to bear upon the {{instances}} of contentment about him. He developed an opinion that all men and many women were potentially at least as restless as himself. A huge proportion of the usage and education in modern life struck upon him now as being a training in contentment. Or rather in keeping quiet and not upsetting things. The serious and responsible life of an ordinary prosperous man fulfilling the requirements of our social organization fatigues and neither completely satisfies nor completely occupies. Still less does the responsible part {{of the life of}} a woman of the prosperous classes engage all her energies or hold her imagination. And there has grown up a great <b>informal</b> <b>organization</b> of employments, games, ceremonies, social routines, travel, to consume these surplus powers and excessive cravings, which might otherwise change or shatter the whole order of human living. He began to understand the forced preoccupation with cricket and golf, the shooting, visiting, and so forth, to which the young people of the economically free classes in the community are trained. He discovered a theory for hobbies and specialized interests. He began to see why people go to Scotland to get away from London, and come to London to get away from Scotland, why they crowd to and fro along the Riviera, swarm over Switzerland, shoot, yacht, hunt, and maintain an immense apparatus of racing and motoring. Because so they are able to remain reasonably contented with the world as it is. He perceived, too, that a man who has missed or broken through the training to this kind of life, does not again very readily subdue himself to the security of these systematized distractions. His own upbringing had been antipathetic to any such adaptations; his years of research had given him the habit of naked intimacy with truth, filled him with a craving for reality and the destructive acids of a relentless critical method.|$|E
