500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she forgot about it). In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Cypria, {{part of the}} Epic Cycle, Helen was the {{daughter}} of Zeus and the goddess Nemesis. The date of the Cypria is uncertain, but it is generally thought to preserve traditions that date back to at least the 7th centuryBC. In the Cypria, Nemesis did not wish to mate with Zeus. She therefore changed shape into various animals as she attempted to flee Zeus, finally becoming a goose. Zeus also transformed himself into a goose and mated with Nemesis, who produced an egg from which Helen was born. Presumably, in the Cypria, this egg was somehow transferred to Leda. Later sources state either that it was brought to Leda by a shepherd who discovered it in a grove in Attica, or that it was dropped <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> by Hermes.* Hard & Rose, The Roudlegde Handbook, 438–439 ...|$|E

60|$|Oddly, {{a sickening}} {{sense of the}} meanness of all these deceits and subterfuges {{suddenly}} came over Mrs. Bunker. Without replying {{she went to her}} bedroom and returned with Colonel Marion's last letter, which she tossed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> visitor's <b>lap.</b>|$|R

60|$|It was {{arranged}} {{that the two}} girls should carry baskets of fruit on their heads, and that Hester should have the biscuits conveniently in her right hand, {{so as to be}} able to drop them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>lap</b> without stopping or even checking her pace as they passed.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the poets}} share this {{intensity}} when they speak about language. One woman describes her relationship {{to her first}} language {{in terms of a}} primal, infantile love. Like a little girl crawling <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother’s <b>lap,</b> she says, she sinks <b>into</b> <b>her</b> native tongue when she is emotionally strained. And when she hears it spoken, it feels like drinking motherly milk.|$|R

6000|$|The pale, {{pretty girl}} seemed indifferent. The {{sealskin}} lady looked crosser than ever. The khaki boy said, [...] "Just my luck," [...] {{and two of}} the children began to cry. Aunt Cyrilla took some apples and striped candy sticks from her basket and carried them to them. She lifted the oldest <b>into</b> <b>her</b> ample <b>lap</b> and soon had them all around her, laughing and contented.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{you must}} be lonesome in this big place; but I'm right glad to have seen you, miss; I can part with the little dear with a better heart, for Mrs. Aylward don't care for children, and Jenny Bowles is a rough wench, wrapped up in her own child, and won't be no good to the others.

[...] added Patt, {{bounding}} across the floor like a young deer, throwing herself <b>into</b> <b>her</b> guardian's <b>lap,</b> hugging and kissing him as if she were nothing but a child, though a fine young woman of nineteen. [...] "Yes, it is Mary Warren, and uncle Hodge is a delightful old gentleman--no, a delightful young gentleman, and were he only thirty years younger he should have his own heiress for a wife himself. Good, dear, generous, sensible uncle Ro. This is so like him, after all his disappointment; for I know, Hugh, his heart was set on your marrying Henrietta." ...|$|R
60|$|With this {{he pulled}} out an {{enormous}} canvas bag, full and rotund as the money-bag of the giant whom Jack slew, untied it, and shook the contents out <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> as she sat in her low chair by the fire. A mass of sovereigns and guineas (there were guineas on the earth in those days) fell <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> with a sudden thud, weighing down her gown to the floor.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed her}} a little packet. She dropped it idly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> She was looking steadfastly away from them.|$|E
60|$|At last Miss Calthea let her sewing drop <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and sat {{looking at}} an empty shelf {{opposite}} to her.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat still}} {{considering}} {{him from the}} piano stool, her knees apart, her hands folded in <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Mockery came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{sank back}} to her chair, folded her hands in <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and fell <b>into</b> meditation. The faintest of flushes crept <b>into</b> <b>her</b> wax-like cheeks.|$|R

5000|$|Isabella Macdonald {{was born}} in Rochester, New York to well-educated parents Myra Spafford Macdonald and Isaac Alden. The father was a temperance man with {{pronounced}} convictions upon subjects regarding social reform, {{as well as an}} abolitionist because he believed slavery to be a sin. The mother was devoted to everything that was [...] "pure and of good report." [...] The sixth of seven children, she was initially home-schooled by her father, who also gave her the nickname Pansy, because of an incident that occurred in her childhood. Her mother had taken great pride in a bed of pansy blossoms. The child, seeing the flowers, and thinking there was no one more deserving of them than her mother, pulled them and threw them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>lap</b> exclaiming, [...] "I pulled every one for you." [...] She could not understand her mother's look of distress. The father, seeing the disappointed look on the little girl's face, picked her up, seated her on his shoulder and said, [...] "Never mind, baby, you shall always be my little pansy-blossom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “As {{concerns}} myself, I can {{boast of}} no particular progress in [...] politics; I adhered (after 1848) {{to the same}} democratic principles [...] which had the homage of my youth, and for which I have ever since [...] glowed with increasing fervor. In theology, on the contrary, I must [...] accuse myself of retrogression, since, as I have already confessed, I [...] returned to the old superstition—to a personal God. This fact is, [...] once for all, not to be stifled, as many enlightened and well-meaning [...] friends would fain have had it. But I must expressly contradict the [...] report that my retrograde movement has carried me {{as far as to}} the [...] threshold of a Church, and that I have even been received <b>into</b> <b>her</b> [...] <b>lap.</b> No: my religions convictions and views have remained free from [...] any tincture of ecclesiasticism; no chiming of bells has allured me, [...] no altar candles have dazzled me. I have dallied with no dogmas, and [...] have not utterly renounced my reason.” ...|$|R
60|$|Then she relapsed {{into the}} same mute looking <b>into</b> space, <b>her</b> hands folded on <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Paul, looking at her, felt he could not breathe. The house was dead silent.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Cutler {{stared at}} him a moment searchingly, and then turned wearily away.

6000|$|The {{younger sister}} sank <b>into</b> <b>her</b> seat colorless and astonished.

6000|$|Marcia leaned forward, {{and brushed}} a tendril of the baby's {{hair out of}} its eye.
