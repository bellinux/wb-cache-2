Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a flash fire hazard; hence <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|Containers are {{intended}} to be used constantly, being loaded with new cargo for a new destination soon after having been emptied of previous cargo. This is not always possible, and in some cases, the cost of transporting an empty container {{to a place where}} it can be used is considered to be higher than the worth of the used container. Shipping lines and container leasing companies have become expert at repositioning <b>empty</b> <b>containers</b> from areas of low or no demand, such as the US West Coast, to areas of high demand, such as China. Repositioning within the port hinterland has also been the focus of recent logistics optimization work. However, damaged or retired containers may also be recycled in the form of shipping container architecture, or the steel content salvaged. In the summer of 2010, a worldwide shortage of containers developed as shipping increased after the recession, while new container production had largely ceased.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} liner {{shipping}} service network design problem with combined hub-and-spoke and multi-port-calling operations and <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning. It first introduces a novel concept - segment - {{defined as a}} pair of ordered ports served by one shipping line and subsequently develops a mixed-integer linear programming model for the proposed problem. Extensive numerical experiments based on realistic Asia-Europe-Oceania shipping operations show that the proposed model can be efficiently solved by CPLEX for real-case problems. They also demonstrate the potential for large cost-savings over pure hub-and-spoke or pure multi-port-calling network, or network without considering <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning.

Two key and interrelated issues, those of deploying ships and containers are usually treated separately by most existing studies on shipping network design.

40|$|<b>Empty</b> <b>container</b> {{repositioning}} (ECR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues in the liner shipping industry. Not only does it have an economic effect on the stakeholders in the container transport chain, but it also has an environmental and sustainability impact on the society since the reduction of <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> movements will reduce fuel consumption, and reduce congestion and emissions. This chapter first analyzes the main reasons that cause <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> repositioning. Secondly, we provide a literature review with the emphasis on modeling the ECR problem from the network scope, e. g. modeling ECR in seaborne transportation network, modeling ECR in inland or intermodal transportation network, and treating ECR as a sub-problem or a constraint under other decision-making problems. Thirdly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the logistics channel scope perspective, which are categorized into four groups including organizational solutions, intra-channel solutions, inter-channel solutions, and technological innovations. Fourthly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the modelling technique perspective, which includes two broad research streams: network flow models and inventory control-based models. We then present two specific models representing the above two research streams, which aim to tackle the ECR problems in stochastic dynamic environments considering both laden and <b>empty</b> <b>container</b> management...|$|R
