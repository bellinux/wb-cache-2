5|$|Malmö FF {{made the}} {{transition}} from amateurism to full professionalism in the late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} club chairman Eric Persson. An open member association, the club's annual <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> is the highest policy-making body. Each club member has one vote, so no shares are issued. The <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and other board members, and decides on incoming motions. The current chairman is Håkan Jeppsson, who has been chairman since 2010, when he replaced Bengt Madsen. The club's legal status means that any interest claims are made to the club, and not {{to the board of directors}} or club members. Day-to-day operations are overseen by a managing director, who liaises with the chairman.|$|E

5|$|Sheppard {{and other}} MCC rebels called a Special <b>General</b> <b>Meeting</b> of the MCC; {{they wanted the}} MCC to state {{publicly}} that the team selection had been mishandled and that no further cricket should take place with South Africa until cricket there had been made non-racial. Before the meeting took place, the General Committee met the rebels and initially claimed {{that it would have}} been inappropriate to ask South Africa about D'Oliveira before the tour—although they had done so. The committee then admitted writing a letter but said that they had never received a reply. The Special <b>General</b> <b>Meeting</b> took place in December 1968, but the rebels were outvoted by the other members; Sheppard was criticised by members at the meeting, and his former friend Peter May refused to talk to him afterwards. Those opposing Sheppard suggested that he opposed apartheid whereas the committee wanted to advance cricket. It was also suggested that the MCC should not act as the conscience of Great Britain. Williams suggests that the vote indicated that a high proportion of the MCC favoured maintaining cricketing links with South Africa despite knowing that South African cricket operated racial segregation.|$|E

He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run The Watch Tower from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.|$|E

The following general assembly in December 2005, GB Group made a private placement of NOK 11.7 million in Ofotbanen, increasing the consortium's ownership to 52%.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unsuccessful}} tour to South Africa in 1964, the WRU set up {{a working}} party on coaching. The party recommended that Welsh clubs accept the principle of coaching. David Nash was appointed as the national team's first coach in 1967, but for the 1968 tour of Argentina, the WRU initially planned {{not to have a}} coach tour with the team. Following pressure from the Welsh clubs at the WRU's annual <b>general</b> <b>meeting,</b> the decision was reversed and Clive Rowlands was appointed as coach for the tour. The appointing of a coach for the team coincided with Wales' success in the Five Nations during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} at a <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally {{afford to buy}} Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for £650 less than the price of Anfield three years earlier, with Goodison Park having more land and a 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously. Dr. Baxter also lent the club £5,000 to redeem the mortgage early {{at a rate of}} 3½%. By this time the redrawing of political boundaries put Walton, and hence Goodison Park, inside the City of Liverpool.|$|E
40|$|We study annual <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> of {{shareholders}} in the Netherlands. The Dutch {{corporate governance}} system {{is characterized by}} relatively concentrated shareholdings and large stakes owned by pension funds, banks and insurance companies. The legal protection of shareholders is poor due {{to the presence of}} takeover defenses, such as certificates, which deprive shareholders from their voting rights. An analysis of the minutes of 245 <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> in the period 1998 – 2002 reveals that on average 30 % of the equity capital is represented at the meeting. All proposals at the meeting are sponsored by the management and only 9 out of 1, 583 proposals are rejected or withdrawn. Our analyses show that pension funds are the most active and critical shareholders at the meetings, while certificates effectively restrict shareholder rights. Our main conclusion is that the <b>general</b> <b>meetings</b> do not provide shareholders in the Netherlands any significant influence on management.

5|$|On 15 September 1891, a <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> {{took place}} at Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. Everton's {{chairman}} John Houlding proposed that a limited company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's adjacent land for a combined £9,237. A club run as a limited company was unusual for the time as football clubs were usually run as “sports clubs” with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary and {{a close friend of}} Houlding.|$|E
5|$|The LM {{sought to}} {{seize control of}} the LCL agenda by winning key {{positions}} on the state executive at the annual <b>general</b> <b>meeting</b> in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM's plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% {{of the vote in}} a narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.|$|E
