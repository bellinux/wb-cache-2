5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only did}} Dershowitz {{improperly}} present Peters's ideas, {{he may not}} even <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> to read the original sources she used {{to come up with}} them. Finkelstein somehow managed to get uncorrected page proofs of The Case for Israel in which Dershowitz appears to direct his research assistant to go to certain pages and notes in Peters's book and place them in his footnotes directly (32, col. 3).|$|E

25|$|Talks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath {{may have}} been bugged. Heath did not {{publicly}} display his anger, with aides {{saying that he was}} unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Stuart Morris, a {{historian}} who helped to provide research for Steel for the Portland show, commented: [...] "I {{was amazed that}} he should have absorbed so much of the island's history in the short period of time that he had. He joked about the Portland winds, saying that in comparison, islanders wouldn't even <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> to take out their kites in the face of Hurricane Katrina. He made a few remarks about Portland/Weymouth rivalry and our Weymouth friends present laughed as much as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E

2500|$|He became {{deputy chief}} judge of Mega-City One {{in the year}} 2100, {{after the death of}} the {{previous}} deputy Fodder. Chief Judge Goodman was unaware of Cal's corruption but still did not like his deputy: initially he felt Cal took himself too seriously and then later, when Cal said he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> with a trial if he was chief, told him [...] "then thank drokk you're not Chief Judge".|$|E
2500|$|Frale {{stated the}} {{text on the}} Shroud reads: [...] "In the year 16 {{of the reign of}} the Emperor Tiberius Jesus the Nazarene, taken down in the early evening after having been {{condemned}} to death by a Roman judge because he was found guilty by a Hebrew authority, is hereby sent for burial with the obligation of being consigned to his family only after one full year." [...] Since Tiberius became emperor after the death of Octavian Augustus in AD 14, the 16th year of his reign would be within the span of the years AD 30 to 31. Frale's methodology has been criticized, partly based on the objection that the writings are too faint to see. Dr Antonio Lombatti, an Italian historian, rejected the idea that the authorities would <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> to tag the body of a crucified man. He stated that [...] "It's all the result of imagination and computer software." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with William Samuel Johnson, Ellsworth {{served as}} one of Connecticut's first two United States {{senators}} in the new federal government, and his service extended from 1789 to 1796. [...] During this period he played a dominant role in Senate proceedings equivalent to that of Senate Majority Leaders in later decades. [...] According to John Adams, he was [...] "the firmest pillar of [...] whole administration in the Senate." [...] Aaron Burr complained that if Ellsworth had misspelled {{the name of the}} Deity with two D's, [...] "it would have taken the Senate three weeks to expunge the superfluous letter." [...] Senator William Maclay, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, offered a more hostile assessment: [...] "He will absolutely say anything, nor can I believe he has a particle of principle in his composition," [...] and [...] "I can in truth pronounce him one of the most candid men I ever knew possessing such abilities." [...] What seems to <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> McClay the most was Ellsworth's emphasis on private negotiations and tacit agreement rather than public debate. [...] Significantly, there was no official record of Senate proceedings for {{the first five years of}} its existence, nor was there any provision to accommodate spectators. The arrangement was essentially the same as for the 1787 Convention, in contrast to the open sessions of the House of Representatives.|$|E
2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom <b>have</b> <b>bothered</b> {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
