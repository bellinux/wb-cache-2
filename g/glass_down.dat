60|$|Of the two Mrs. Watson was {{certainly}} the most nervous. Her fingers shook so that the wine in her glass was spilt. She set her <b>glass</b> <b>down</b> and looked across at her companion.|$|E

60|$|Nan set the <b>glass</b> <b>down</b> with {{a decided}} thud. John's curtness displeased her. He needn't suppose {{that it made}} any {{difference}} to her if he took it into his stupid head to go to Afghanistan.|$|E
