50|$|In March 1882, Gibbon {{sold the}} {{property}} to James Cowlishaw for £2000, as Gibbon was intending to return to England. The property was subdivided, and the house on 2.6 hectares was acquired by Brisbane importer Robert W Wilson, who carried out extensive renovations. It is likely the southern wing and the billiards wing were added at this time. By mid-1886 the main house contained a large drawing room 40 feet by 21 feet, a dining room 26 x 18 feet, a butler's pantry in the recess leading to the kitchen, four bedrooms, two dressing rooms, three bathrooms with plunge and shower baths, and nursery. The front verandah had been extended to 20 feet in depth, and all the verandah posts had been replaced with decorative iron columns. A detached rendered brick building with a flat parapet roof, had been erected, and this contained a billiard room, three bedrooms, and a lavatory. The service wing contained a kitchen, servant's hall, three servant's bedrooms, pantry with fireproof strongroom, storeroom and double cellar. The house was fitted with electric bells, and gas was laid on throughout both house and outbuildings. These included laundry, stables, coachhouse, men's <b>rooms,</b> harness and <b>feed</b> <b>rooms,</b> groom's cottage and a four-roomed gate lodge.

50|$|Rufus Wilson Complex is a {{group of}} {{historic}} buildings located at Clear Spring, Washington County, Maryland, United States. The property includes a complex of mid-late 19th century buildings which create the center of a small rural settlement named Conococheague located on the National Road. The main house is a large brick dwelling with a mansard roof. This house incorporates a -story limestone dwelling built about 1850 by Rufus Wilson, which was enlarged to its present Second Empire style {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. Adjacent to the house is a brick post office and store, built about 1880 by Wilson, with an attached <b>feed</b> <b>room</b> of frame construction with weatherboard siding.

50|$|In 1912, {{three blocks}} {{of land in}} Cedar Street were {{declared}} a police reserve and plans for police quarters and station, offices and cells were drawn up and estimated to cost £750. Although a police constable was appointed to serve Yungaburra in 1913, {{the building of a}} police station did not go ahead; instead a cottage was rented and a stable and <b>feed</b> <b>room</b> built for police use. On 29 January 1914, the Yungaburra District Progress Association wrote to the Home Secretary's Office asking that a Court of Petty Sessions be established in Yungaburra. At the time, the nearest court was in Atherton, which was inconvenient for settlers in and around Yungaburra. Both towns were within the Herberton Petty Sessions District. The request was denied on the grounds that few cases from the Yungaburra district were heard and all public offices were in Atherton, so that people from the surrounding area travelled there to conduct business in any case. A lockup was provided at Yungaburra in September 1914, however.|$|E

5000|$|In birds, time-place {{learning}} {{has been confirmed}} in garden warblers, [...] starlings, weavers, and pigeons. [...] Garden warblers could learn to visit four rooms inside a large aviary, one during each quarter of a day. It took them only 11 days to learn, with 70% accuracy, to visit the correct room at the correct daily time to get food. The spatio-temporal pattern of visits was then maintained even when food was made available in all rooms at all times. As with circadian rhythms of activity, the spatio-temporal pattern of room visits shifted gradually over several days following a 6-h advance of the day-night cycle, and it ran freely with a non-24 h periodicity for up to 6 days when the birds were placed under constant 24-h dim light and constant food availability. Starlings can show similar patterns, with free-runs up to 11 days in constant dim light. The insectivorous weaver bird Ploceus bicolor can also learn to associate four <b>feeding</b> <b>rooms</b> with four <b>feeding</b> times, and it maintains the correct spatio-temporal pattern even {{when one of the}} rooms is blocked on test days (the bird then waits for the next feeding time and visits the appropriate room for that time); however, room blocking disrupts the spatio-temporal pattern in the granivorous weaver bird Euplectes hordaceus, which suggests that time-place learning may be stronger in species for which food in nature is more likely to vary spatio-temporally (as is the case for insects, as opposed to grain). Finally, pigeons can learn to peck one key to get food in the morning, and another key in the afternoon, and they maintain this pattern for four days in constant light.|$|R
