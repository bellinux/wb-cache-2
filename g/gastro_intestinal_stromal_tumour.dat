40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 71 year old man with {{recurrence}} of a <b>Gastro</b> <b>Intestinal</b> <b>Stromal</b> <b>Tumour</b> (GIST) at the gastrojejunal anastomosis eight years following partial gastrectomy for a very small primary gastric GIST. He presented acutely on both occasions with haemodynamic shock secondary to massive haematemesis. During his initial presentation in 2001, an emergency laparotomy was performed, demonstrating a pre-pyloric ulcerative lesion. The histopathology was in keeping with a diagnosis of a gastric GIST with a < 2 cm tumour, with < 5 mitosis per 50 /HPF, no signs of necrosis and invasion limited to the mucosa. Eight years later the same patient presented with a similar clinical picture of haemodynamic instability secondary to haematemesis. Emergency endoscopy showed an irregularly shaped elevated lesion on the gastrojejunostomy line suggestive of recurrence. He subsequently underwent completion gastrectomy and the histology revealed a 0. 8 cm GIST tumour composed of spindle cells with < 5 mitosis per 50 /HPF, tumor invasion into the submucosa and positive expression of c-kit and SMA. The patient remains recurrence free 18 months post surgery. The literature suggests that tumour size, mitotic rate and tumour site are the most important predictive factors of recurrence. Additional features such as the presence of necrosis, local tumour invasion and positive resection margins, can also influence recurrence rates. In this case the lesion was a gastric GIST, very small (< 2 cm), had low proliferation rate (< 5 mitosis/HPF), lacked necrosis and was limited to the mucosa. Recurrence of such a primary GIST at the anastomotic line, eight years after initial resection has never been demonstrated among review of several thousand primary GISTs. This case highlights how even the most innocent GISTs can never be described as truly benign...|$|E
30|$|AMP is a {{polysaccharide}} {{derived from}} natural sources (Endoclotplus 2014). The substance has no reaction with components of human blood but promotes clotting through a dehydrating mechanism increasing {{the concentration of}} clotting factors and cells at the site. The residual particles are lysed by amylase and glucoamylase and is completely cleared from the site within few hours to days (Endoclotplus 2014). Halkerston et al. (2013) reported in a short case series of six patients treated with AMP as an adjunct {{in the management of}} upper gastrointestinal bleeding and colonic bleeding following endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Patel et al. 2014 recently reported the safety and efficacy of AMP in 18 patients with a 89 % (n =  16) success in achieving hemostasis. In their case series the upper intestinal bleeds (n =  16) were initially managed with adrenaline injections, clipping and diathermy whereas for the lower intestinal bleeds (n =  3), all following EMR, argon plasma coagulation was also utilized. In two patients who developed delayed hemorrhage, despite initial response to AMP, the authors found a <b>gastro</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour</b> (1) and a Dieulafoy lesion (2), suggesting that use of Endoclot™ must be restricted to a facilitatory role and should not replace conventional attempts to achieve hemostasis. Our patient was a high-risk candidate for intraoperative bleeding due to existing liver failure. As bleeding occurred {{from the surface of the}} liver application of clips was not technically possible. Although AMP Endoclot™ has not been previously used at an intra-peritoneal site, there is evidence for safety of its use on raw surfaces as reported in EMR of colonic polyps (Halkerston et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2014). None of the case series in the literature has reported side effects with AMP usage.|$|E

30|$|Morcellation of uterine leiomyomas {{became a}} hot issue when Amy Reed, MD, an {{anesthesiologist}} at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, underwent this procedure in October 2013. However, an unsuspected uterine leiomyosarcoma was morcellated {{and could have}} worsened her prognosis by spreading the cancer around her abdomen. Since that moment, Dr. Reed’s husband, cardiothoracic surgeon Hooman Noorchashm, MD, PhD, has led a campaign calling for a ban on morcellation. Uterine leiomyomas are present in approximately 40  % in women of 40 – 50  years of age. These benign tumors should be discerned from malignant counter parts including leiomyosarcoma (LMS), smooth muscle tumours of unknown malignant potential (STUMP), endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), undifferentiated sarcoma (rare, high grade), adenosarcoma (rare, low grade) and very rare tumors including angiosarcoma, hemangio pericytoma, pleomorphic, liposarcoma, desmoplastic, <b>Gastro</b> <b>Intestinal</b> <b>Stromal</b> Tumor… Incidence rates obtained from NORDCAN and NOCCA databases during the study-period 1978 – 2007, were about 0.3 per 100, 000 for ESS and about 0.4 per 100, 000 for LMS in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway [1]. In Norway, 419 uterine sarcomas were registered from 1970 – 2000 [2].|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about whether imatinib, a {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor, is successful enough {{as a treatment}} for <b>gastro</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>stromal</b> tumor (GIST) patients. Of all GISTs 70 - 80 % harbor mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, 5 - 8 % in the platelet derived growth factor α tyrosine kinase (PDGFRA) and 12 - 15 % do not harbor any KIT- or PDGFRA mutations (wild-type GISTs). The KIT- or PDGFRA mutations are oncogenic driver mutations, that lead to constant activation of the downstream pathways, which leads to GIST progression. Imatinib inhibits signaling of mutated KIT and mutated PDGFRA in GISTs. Overall imatinib can prevent GIST progression in more than 70 % of all GISTs. The problem is that imatinib cannot prevent progression in wild-type GISTs and can only prevent progression in some PDGFRA-mutated GISTs. On top of this imatinib-sensitive GISTs develop drug resistance, probably because imatinib does not actively eradicate all GIST cells. There are many ideas of how to improve treatment of GIST patients, but the most promising for imatinib-resistant GISTs are inhibitors of downstream components of the KIT- or PDGFRA pathway. These promising new drugs do not only prevent GIST progression, but also introduce apoptosis. ...|$|R
40|$|Capsule {{endoscopy}} {{was conceived}} by Gabriel Iddan and Paul Swain independently two decades ago. These applications include {{but are not}} limited to Crohn&#x 2019;s disease of the small bowel, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, non steroidal anti inflammatory drug induced small bowel disease, carcinoid tumors of the small bowel, <b>gastro</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>stromal</b> tumors of the small bowel and other disease affecting the small bowel. Capsule endoscopy has been compared to traditional small bowel series, computerized tomography studies and push enteroscopy. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy has consistently been superior in the diagnosis of small bowel disease compared to the competing methods (small bowel series, computerized tomography, push enteroscopy) of diagnosis. For this reason capsule endoscopy has enjoyed a meteoric success. Image quality has been improved with increased number of pixels, automatic light exposure adaptation and wider angle of view. Further applications of capsule endoscopy of other areas of the digestive tract are being explored. The increased transmission rate of images per second has made capsule endoscopy of the esophagus a realistic possibility. Technological advances that include a double imager capsule with a nearly panoramic view of the colon and a variable frame rate adjusted to the movement of the capsule in the colon have made capsule endoscopy of the colon feasible. The diagnostic rate for the identification of patients with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm is high. Future advances in technology and biotechnology will lead to further progress. Capsule endoscopy is following the successful modern trend in medicine that replaces invasive tests with less invasive methodology...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypercalcemia is {{the most}} common oncologic {{metabolic}} emergency but very rarely observed in patients with gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour,</b> which is a rare mesenchymal malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract. We describe a case of hypercalcemia caused by elevated levels of activated vitamin D in a patient with gastrointestinal tumour. Prior to this case report, only one paper has reported an association between hypercalcemia, gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumours</b> and elevated levels of vitamin D. Case presentation: An otherwise healthy 70 -year-old Caucasian woman, previously treated for duodenal gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour,</b> was diagnosed with liver metastasis, and relapse of gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour</b> was confirmed by biopsy. At presentation, the patient suffered from severe symptoms of hypercalcemia. The most common causes of hypercalcemia, hyperparathyrodism, parathyroid hormone-related peptide secretion from tumour cells, and metastatic bone disease, were all dismissed as the etiology. Analysis of vitamin D subtypes revealed normal levels of both 25 -OH Vitamin D 2 and 25 -OH Vitamin D 3, whereas the level of activated vitamin D, 1, 25 OH Vitamin D 3, also referred to as calcitriol, was elevated. Conclusion: The fact that plasma calcitriol decreased after initiation of oncological treatment and the finding that hypercalcemia did not recur during treatment support the conclusion that elevated calcitriol was a consequence of the gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour.</b> We suggest that gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumours</b> should be added to the list of causes of humoral hypercalcemia in malignancy, and propose that gastrointestinal <b>stromal</b> <b>tumour</b> tissue may have high activity of the specific enzyme 1 α-hydroxylase, which can lead to increased levels of calcitriol and secondarily hypercalcemia...|$|R
