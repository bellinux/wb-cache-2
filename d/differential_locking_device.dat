40|$|Abstract—Locking {{devices are}} widely used in robotics, for {{instance}} to lock springs, joints or to reconfigure robots. This review paper classifies the <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> currently described in literature and preforms a comparative study. Designers can therefore better determine which <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> best matches {{the needs of their}} application. The <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> are divided into three main categories based on different locking principles: me-chanical locking, friction-based locking and singularity <b>locking.</b> Different <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> in each category can be passive or active. Based on an extensive literature survey, the paper summarizes the findings by comparing different <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> on a set of properties of an ideal <b>locking</b> <b>device.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new kind}} of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> is introduced. Aiming at the 1 # {{centrifuge}} of CAEP(China Academy of Engineering Physics), the mechanical design of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> has been done, and its maximum locking torque is 8000 N·M. The simulation model has been established in ANSYS to obtain key parameters of the <b>locking</b> <b>device,</b> such as the thickness of shaft, the distribution of circular groove, the working pressure of oil source and so on. Through the test, the feasibility of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> is validated. Introduction[1, 2] Generally used <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> includes key connection, interference connection and so on. For these devices, many disadvantages are included such as inconvenient assembly, difficult processing and so on. At present, the nacelle of the 1 # centrifuge is locked with bolts, and the nacelle can only be locked in several special angles. Therefore, it’s not able to meet the requirement of acceleratio...|$|R
5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> {{that consists}} of an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>devices</b> can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> remains <b>locked</b> when power is lost. Fail-safe <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R

40|$|A new Research Reactor (ARR) {{has been}} under design by KAERI since 2002. In this work, {{as a first step}} for the design of the fuel {{assembly}} of the ARR, the conceptual design has been carried out. The vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel model and the locking performance of the preliminary designed <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were investigated. In order to investigate the effects of the stiffener on the vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel, a modal analysis was performed for the finite element models of the tubular fuels with stiffeners and without stiffeners. The analysis results show that the vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel with stiffeners are better than those of the tubular fuel without stiffeners. To investigate the locking performance of the preliminary designed <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> for the fuel assembly of the ARR, the elements of the <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were fabricated. Then the torsional resistance, fixing status and vibration characteristics of the <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were tested. The test results show that using the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> with fins on the bottom guide can prevent the torsional motion of the fuel assembly, and that additional springs or guides {{on the top of the}} fuel assembly are needed to suppress the lateral motion of the fuel assembly. Based on the modal analysis and experimental results, the fuel assembly and <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> of the ARR were designed and its prototype was fabricated. The locking performance, pressure drop characteristics and vibration characteristics of the newly designed fuel assembly will be tested in the near future...|$|R
