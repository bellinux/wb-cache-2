5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy.
