5|$|Among {{the most}} {{geographically}} diverse states, Oklahoma {{is one of}} four to harbor more than 10 distinct <b>ecological</b> regions, with 11 in its borders – more per square mile than in any other state. Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight <b>ecological</b> regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer <b>ecological</b> regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} <b>ecological</b> {{organization}} is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. <b>Ecological</b> relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. <b>Ecological</b> theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in <b>ecological</b> theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} sub-Himalayan belt {{geographical}} and <b>ecological</b> characteristics. An ecotourism destination, it contains 488 {{different species of}} plants and a diverse variety of fauna. The increase in tourist activities, among other problems, continues to present a serious challenge to the park's <b>ecological</b> balance.|$|E
5|$|After the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, biodiversity required substantial time to recover, {{despite the}} existence of abundant vacant <b>ecological</b> niches.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of <b>ecological</b> niches and exploit many {{different}} food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their <b>ecological</b> dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the <b>ecological</b> zones that they {{inhabited}} during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various <b>ecological</b> zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all <b>ecological</b> niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, new {{instruments}} such as life-cycle assessment (LCA) were invented which allowed <b>ecological</b> considerations {{to be introduced}} into marketing decisions.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. <b>Ecological</b> selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as <b>ecological</b> selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for <b>ecological</b> quality. The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for <b>ecological</b> quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for <b>ecological</b> quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E

5|$|It is believed, {{based on}} the <b>ecological</b> conditions, that C.maenas could {{eventually}} extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska. Similar <b>ecological</b> conditions {{are to be found}} on many of the world's coasts, with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being New Zealand; the New Zealand government has taken action, including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C.maenas.|$|E

5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of <b>ecological</b> economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading <b>ecological</b> economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an <b>ecological</b> balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the <b>ecological</b> balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular <b>ecological</b> research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new <b>ecological</b> field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992. Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and <b>ecological</b> context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an <b>ecological</b> or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating <b>ecological</b> questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of species}} from <b>ecological</b> communities, defaunation, is {{primarily}} driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, <b>ecological</b> communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E

5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct <b>ecological</b> communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for <b>ecological</b> processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in <b>ecological</b> communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some <b>ecological</b> principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E
5|$|Therian mammals {{took over}} the medium- to large-sized <b>ecological</b> niches in the Cenozoic, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event approximately 66 million years ago emptied <b>ecological</b> space once filled by non-avian dinosaurs and other groups of reptiles, as well as various other mammal groups, and underwent an exponential increase in body size (megafauna). Then mammals diversified very quickly; both birds and mammals show an exponential rise in diversity. For example, the earliest known bat dates from about 50 million years ago, only 16 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|While the National Parks Act and the 1988 {{amendment}} emphasize <b>ecological</b> integrity, {{in practice}} Banff {{has suffered from}} inconsistent application of the policies. In 1994, the Banff-Bow Valley Study was mandated by Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for Parks Canada, to provide recommendations on how to better manage human use and development, and maintain <b>ecological</b> integrity. While the two-year Banff-Bow Valley Study was underway, development projects were halted, including the expansion of Sunshine Village, and the twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway between Castle Junction and Sunshine.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, J. Moore used {{a similar}} metaphor. Instead of using {{military}} terms, he created an <b>ecological</b> theory of predators and prey(see <b>ecological</b> model of competition), {{a sort of}} Darwinian management strategy in which market interactions mimic long term <b>ecological</b> stability.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of Biogeography in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used <b>ecological</b> niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer Bigfoot's preferred <b>ecological</b> parameters. They found a very close match with the <b>ecological</b> parameters of the American black bear, Ursus americanus. They also note that an upright bear looks much like Bigfoot's purported appearance and consider it highly improbable that two species should have very similar <b>ecological</b> preferences, concluding that Bigfoot sightings are likely sightings of black bears.|$|E
25|$|A {{tentative}} distinction can be {{made between}} mathematical ecologists, ecologists who apply mathematics to <b>ecological</b> problems, and mathematicians who develop the mathematics itself that arises out of <b>ecological</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream {{economics}} {{has attempted}} to become a value-free 'hard science', but <b>ecological</b> economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. <b>Ecological</b> economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost-benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. <b>Ecological</b> economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development, and may have goals similar to green politics.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>ecological</b> {{effects can}} arise from {{stimulating}} primary production, {{but there are}} three particularly troubling <b>ecological</b> impacts: decreased biodiversity, changes in species composition and dominance, and toxicity effects.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>ecological</b> economists {{prioritise}} adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These <b>ecological</b> economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, <b>ecological</b> economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, <b>ecological</b> economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E

25|$|Early modern {{interest}} in ecology and economics {{dates back to}} the 1940s in the work of K. William Kapp and Karl Polanyi and the 1960s in work by Kenneth Boulding and Herman Daly. However, the first organized meetings of modern <b>ecological</b> economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner, with a meeting held in Sweden (including Robert Costanza, Herman Daly, Charles Hall, Bruce Hannon, H.T. Odum, and David Pimentel). Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of <b>Ecological</b> Modeling to test the waters. A book entitled <b>Ecological</b> Economics, by Juan Martinez-Alier, was published later that year. 1989 saw the foundation of the International Society for <b>Ecological</b> Economics and publication of its journal, <b>Ecological</b> Economics, by Elsevier. Robert Costanza was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, currently edited by Richard Howarth.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} their effect on {{community}} processes, behaviors, and <b>ecological</b> interactions, consumptive interactions {{are some of the}} most widely studied concepts in ecology.
