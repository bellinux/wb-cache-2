Cowen praises the development of India and China as producers and consumers, {{the role of the}} internet in enlarging the scientific community, and a growing consensus for the reform of educational policy in the US. He further suggests for the social status of scientists to be raised to at least as strong a motivating <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> money can.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons of the {{foundation}} that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> a primary influence.|$|E

5|$|Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie {{canceled}} the yearly preseason matchup in Tampa, {{claiming that the}} Buccaneers approached the matchup with excessive intensity, resulting in Dolphin injuries. A dispute with Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse was also a <b>factor,</b> <b>as</b> Culverhouse was promoting a proposed rule to ban NFL owners and their families from holding controlling interest in other sports teams. Robbie's wife Elizabeth {{was the owner of}} the NASL Ft. Lauderdale Strikers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} give off acidic vapors over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and give off acidic vapors with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing <b>factor,</b> <b>as</b> is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|When fielding, Barnes {{stationed}} {{himself as}} close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point. The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> his batting in The Invincibles success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important {{was the fact that the}} knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.|$|E

5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|To {{give each}} world a theme, they were each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important <b>factor</b> <b>as</b> the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E
5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation {{for this}} new storyline was keeping the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of the}} story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience. Among his cited reference points for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important <b>factor.</b> <b>As</b> part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed not to be a perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into her line of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E
