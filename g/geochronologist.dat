50|$|Undamaged zircon {{retains the}} lead {{generated}} by radioactive decay of uranium and thorium until very high temperatures (about 900 °C), though accumulated radiation damage within zones {{of very high}} uranium can lower this temperature substantially. Zircon is very chemically inert and resistant to mechanical weathering—a mixed blessing for <b>geochronologists,</b> as zones or even whole crystals can survive melting of their parent rock with their original uranium-lead age intact. Zircon crystals with prolonged and complex histories can thus contain zones of dramatically different ages (usually, with the oldest and youngest zones forming the core and rim, respectively, of the crystal), and thus are said to demonstrate inherited characteristics. Unraveling such complications (which, depending on their maximum lead-retention temperature, can also exist within other minerals) generally requires in situ micro-beam analysis via, say, ion microprobe (SIMS) or laser ICP-MS.|$|R
40|$|Mountains form where tectonic plates collide, and {{the rates}} and {{timescales}} over which crust is buried, transformed, deformed and recycled in these collision zones informs {{our understanding of}} crustal (re) cycling processes. Recent advances in analytical capability mean that <b>geochronologists</b> {{are now able to}} measure the dates recorded by geochronometers with increasingly precision. Recent data collected via in-situ techniques commonly yield a protracted range of dates rather than a single age. The data therefore suggest that geochronometers may record protracted crystallization over a range of PT conditions rather than a specific ‘event’. The difficulty lies in linking geochronometer crystallization or cooling dates to the precise PT evolution of the host rock. Here we present new insights into the interpretation of metamorphic crystallization (U-Pb) and cooling (Ar/Ar) ages. Trace element data of major and accessory phases are important for fingerprinting accessory phase crystallization reactions.

40|$|Debate {{concerning}} {{the environmental impact}} of human arrival in Australia has continued for more than a century. Here we review the evidence for human impact and the mechanisms by which humans may have affected the environment of tropical Australia. We limit our review to tropical Australia because, over three decades ago, it was proposed that the imposition of an anthropogenic fire regime upon human occupation of the Australian continent may have resulted in profound changes in regional vegetation and climate across this region. We conclude that ecological processes and vegetation–fire–climate–human feedbacks do exist that could have driven a significant shift in boundary conditions and ecosystem state at the sub-continental scale through the sustained imposition of an anthropogenic fire regime over tens of millennia. These potential feedbacks operate through the inhibition of forest expansion both directly, by targeted burning at established forest edges and newly irrupted forest patches, and indirectly, through lengthening of the dry season because of changes to the timing of burning. However, the impact of any such anthropogenic forcing may have been entirely overshadowed by the effects of natural climate change and variability, as well as the generally low nutrient status of Australian soils. A robust assessment {{of the degree to which}} the environment of tropical Australia at the large scale has been modified from its ‘natural’ state because of human occupation will require new, coordinated collaborations between indigenous traditional landowners, archaeologists, anthropologists, <b>geochronologists,</b> geoscientists, ecologists, climatologists and modellers...|$|R

For decades, young-Earth creationists (YECs) have vainly searched the geology and geochemistry literature to find ways of discrediting radiometric dating and protecting their antiquated biblical interpretations. YEC John Woodmorappe (a pseudonym), for example, has been at the forefront in misquoting and misrepresenting radiometric dating results from the geology and geochemistry literature (e. g., Woodmorappe, 1979, 1999). Woodmorappe's shotgun attacks against radiometric dating even include the ridiculous accusation that concordant radiometric dates may be nothing more than products of "chance"; that is, random numbers (Woodmorappe, 1999, Figure 20, p. 51; p. 52, 87 - 92). Woodmorappe (1999, p. 85) even endorses YEC Robert Witter's outrageous charge that <b>geochronologists</b> could obtain just as good radiometric results by throwing darts at a concordia diagram.

40|$|High-precision U-Pb geochronology by isotope dilution-thermal {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{is integral to}} a variety of Earth science disciplines, but its ultimate resolving power is quantified by the uncertainties of calculated U-Pb dates. As analytical techniques have advanced, formerly small sources of uncertainty are increasingly important, and thus previous simplifications for data reduction and uncertainty propagation are no longer valid. Although notable previous efforts have treated propagation of correlated uncertainties for the U-Pb system, the equations, uncertainties, and correlations have been limited in number and subject to simplification during propagation through intermediary calculations. We derive and present a transparent U-Pb data reduction algorithm that transforms raw isotopic data and measured or assumed laboratory parameters into the isotopic ratios and dates <b>geochronologists</b> interpret without making assumptions about the relative size of sample components. To propagate uncertainties and their correlations, we describe, in detail, a linear algebraic algorithm that incorporates all input uncertainties and correlations without limiting or simplifying covariance terms to propagate them though intermediate calculations. Finally, a weighted mean algorithm is presented that utilizes matrix elements from the uncertainty propagation algorithm to propagate random and systematic uncertainties for data comparison between other U-Pb labs and other geochronometers. The linear uncertainty propagation algorithms are verified with Monte Carlo simulations of several typical analyses.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has long}} been known that {{continental}} regions of different age have different seismic properties: the older the lithosphere, the greater the velocity. Here we ask whether we can obtain a more formal relationship between seismological observations and the age of continents. The deep structure of continents has been seismically mapped for the entire Earth. S-vertical travel time delay maps were computed from velocity maps. S-delay maps (using [Shapiro, N. M., Ritzwoller, M. H., 2002. Monte-Carlo inversion of broad-band surface wave dispersion for a global shear wave velocity model of the crust and upper mantle. Geophys. J. Int. 151, 88 - 105]) correlate with maps show a broad correlation with the ages of surface rocks but when studied in detail, the correlation is not good. The histogram of the S delays for continents is not Gaussian but contains two maxima. From a study in North American stations, Romanowicz and Cara [Romanowicz, B. A., Cara, M., 1980. Reconsideration of the relationship between S and P station anomalies in North America. Geophys. Res. Lett. 7, 417 - 420] found that the ratio of S- to P-delay does not fit a linear relationship: different intercept times have to be used for positive and for negative S to P ratios. They explained this by the presence of low-velocity mantle beneath tectonically active regions but not beneath stable cratons. By imposing that the negative peak of the S-delay histogram corresponds to a major period of continent growth, a relationship between S delay and age is obtained. Using this relationship, a “seismic continental growth curve” is derived. This growth curve is similar to curves published by <b>geochronologists</b> in that it shows strong growth between 3 and 1 Ga.

How different my future would have been had the proposal not been vetoed in Ottawa. My new academic freedom to work outside the country was now obligatory. The DNAG (Decade of North American Geology) project had tweaked my interest in Rodinia, the early Neoproterozoic supercontinent, and its partial reincarnation as Gond-wana (Hoffman 1991). Andy Knoll at Harvard was drawing attention to emerging carbon and strontium isotope data from Neoproterozoic carbonate rocks, which provide a means of global correlation and suggested a causal rela-tionship between Rodinia breakup and the unusual association of sedimentary banded iron-formation (BIF) and gla-cial diamictite on the one hand, and between Gondwana assembly, increased oxygenation and the radia-tion of animals on the other (Knoll 1991; Knoll and Walter 1992).

40|$|Monazite is {{a mineral}} {{of choice for}} dating {{metamorphism}} in amphibolite- and granulite-grade metapelites. However, there exist a number of difficulties that complicate the interpretation of monazite geochronological data and prevent its application to many geological problems. The two main obstacles addressed in this contribution are firstly, the minor but significant (e. g. 1 – 30 Ma) dispersal in duplicate isotope dilution thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) U–Pb age data commonly recorded from a single rock, and secondly, the difficulty of attaching monazite age data to pressure and temperature information. Through a multidisciplinary approach utilising TIMS and laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) isotope data, quantitative and qualitative EMP chemical analyses of monazite, and textural studies, we assess the significance of Pb loss, older components, and continuous and episodic monazite growth in the generation of dispersed age data. Three samples from the Canadian Cordillera and one sample from the Himalaya of Pakistan are examined. Each sample exhibits an age dispersion of between 1 and 12 Ma for single crystal and multi-grain TIMS U–Pb monazite age determinations. Consideration of the closure temperature for Pb diffusion in monazite and the metamorphic temperatures experienced by these samples suggests diffusive Pb loss did not play a significant part in generating this age dispersal. The LA-MC-ICPMS study indicates that an older component (< 100 Ma older than the TIMS ages) contributed to the age dispersal {{in three of the}} four samples. In all the samples however, chemical analyses identified that the majority of monazites examined exhibited significant intra-crystalline zoning in Y content. The LA-MC-ICPMS analysis of one sample that was constrained to zones of distinct Y content indicates that these zones are of distinct age. We suggest that monazite grown before the appearance of garnet and during garnet breakdown is relatively rich in Y, whereas monazite grown after garnet is relatively poor in Y. A combination of these chemical data with textural observations suggests that once monazite had entered the mineral assemblage it grew or recrystallised episodically throughout the prograde and retrograde paths of the metamorphic event. This behaviour contributes to, and in one of the samples controls, the observed age dispersal. This recognition allows the generation of pressure–temperatureï¿½time points by combining textural and chemical information of monazite with in situ age determinations, and pressure–temperature information from garnet. Thus, the episodic growth of compositionally distinct monazite throughout a metamorphic event provides the <b>geochronologist</b> with a very valuable chronological tool...|$|E

Owing to the resilience of zircon, even in such severe environments, the link between P–T conditions and geological time is possible. However, a challenge to <b>geochronologists</b> is to define whether the growth of new zircon is related to pre- or post-P–T peak conditions and which processes might affect the (re) crystallization. In this context, the Anápolis–Itauçu Complex, a high-grade complex in central Brazil with ultrahigh temperature (UHT) granulites, may provide valuable information within this topic. The Anápolis–Itauçu Complex (AIC) includes ortho- and paragranulites, locally presenting UHT mineral assemblages, with igneous zircon ages varying between 760 and 650 Ma and metamorphic overgrowths dated at around 650 – 640 Ma. Also common in the Anápolis–Itauçu Complex are layered mafic–ultramafic complexes metamorphosed under high-grade conditions. This article presents the first geological and geochronological constraints of three of these layered complexes within the AIC, the Damolândia, Taquaral and Goianira–Trindade complexes. U–Pb (LA-MC-ICPMS, SHRIMP and ID-TIMS) zircon analyses reveal a spread of concordant ages spanning within an age interval of ~ 80 Ma with an “upper” intercept age of ~ 670 Ma. Under cathodoluminescence imaging, these crystals show partially preserved primary sector zoning, as well as internal textures typical of alteration during high-grade metamorphism, such as inward-moving boundaries. Zircon grains reveal homogeneous initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf values in distinct crystal-scale domains in all samples. Moreover, Hf isotopic ratios show correlation neither with U–Pb ages nor with Th/U ratios, suggesting that zircon grains crystallized during a single growth event. It is suggested, therefore, that the observed spread of concordant U–Pb ages may be related to a memory effect due to coupled dissolution–reprecipitation process during high grade metamorphism.
