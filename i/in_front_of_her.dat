5|$|Behind {{the central}} {{images of the}} lunatic, daemon and gambler are {{a group of people}} who have only just {{realised}} what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E

The four other women were named as co-conspirators in her confession.|$|E
5|$|Stefani portrays several {{characters}} from the books, including Alice, the White Queen, and the Red Queen, in dresses by British-Gibraltarian fashion designer John Galliano. The video frequently cuts to Stefani {{back in the}} studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world. As this transpires the song is recording itself. Stefani ultimately rediscovers her confidence, and her full awareness is transported back to the ordinary reality of the studio just as she dances <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> four giggling Harajuku Girls. She then is presented with her bill by the consultant as a wooden chair topples to the floor.|$|E

Just as Zuko {{is on the verge of}} defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara.

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position himself <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
