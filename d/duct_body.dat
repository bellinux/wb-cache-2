40|$|The duct of the cow, {{sheep and}} goat {{can be divided into}} two main parts, the intrafollicular region and the {{intradermal}} region. Three sub-regions, namely the perifollicular zone, the <b>duct</b> <b>body</b> and the duct/fundus transition zone, can be distinguished within the latter. In the outer portion of the hair follicle, the luminal surface was keratinized but the presence, in the cow and sheep, of surface microvilli with closely associated vesicles deeper within this layer suggested the possibility of a reabsorptive role. The intradermal duct had junctional complexes at the luminal extremity throughout its length. Gap junctions were observed between basal cells only in {{the lower part of the}} <b>duct</b> <b>body.</b> Dovetailing between luminal cells in the intradermal duct was barely noticeable in the cow but prominent in the goat. In the duct/fundus transition zone of all three species there was evidence of cell differentiation, the potential significance of which is discussed. There was little change in the ultrastructure of the duct in any of the three species, other than an increase in lumen size, as a result of heat exposure and sweating activity...|$|E
40|$|Sweating in {{the horse}} {{had little effect}} on the {{ultrastructure}} of the glandular duct, other than on the lumen which enlarged. The fundus secretory cells, which in the resting gland were packed with vesicles, gradually lost them as sweating progressed until, after 4 hours of activity, few remained. Sweat appeared to be largely the product of secretion (a) by fluid transport, probably involving a region of complex cellular interdigitations adjacent to the basement membrane and (b) by exocytosis of vesicles, although a secondary mechanism of vesicle loss by micro-apocrine secretion may occur. However, the products of cell death also contribute to sweat formation. The myoepithelium appeared contracted throughout. The function of the lower <b>duct</b> <b>body,</b> where complex basal infoldings of the luminal cells penetrated to the basement membrane, may differ from that of the upper portion. Dendritic Langerhans cells were found between the epithelia throughout the duct and fundus...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{object is}} to find a manner of {{reduction}} primary noise from a source by an electro acoustic device that cancels unwanted sound by generating an anti sound (anti noise) of equal amplitude and an opposite phase is described as an active noise control system. Materials and Methods: In this method, the primary noise is acquired via a microphone, and the anti noise propagates with the same amplitude and the reverse phase at the primary noise path via a speaker to cancel the original noise. The effectiveness of cancellation of the primary noise depends on the accuracy of the amplitude and phase of the generated anti noise. Results: The results present a noise reduction of 16 dB until 20 dB overall. A change in the system setup and noise power can reach a noise reduction up to 25 dB. Perhaps, {{this is due to the}} background noise and primary noise differences that create a powerful anti noise for canceling the original noise. Conclusions: With regard to the wide range of frequencies of different noise sources, having optimized circumstances in the duct, microphone location on the <b>duct</b> <b>body</b> or even the distance of the speakers may be important in signal processing, noise sampling and anti noise production...|$|E

40|$|Test of a <b>ducted</b> <b>body</b> with Internal flow {{were made}} in the 8 -foot {{high-speed}} wind tunnel for the purpose of studying the effects on external drag and an critical speed of the addition of efficient inlet and outlet openings to a basic streamline shape. Drag tests of a 13. 6 - inch-diameter streamline body of fineness ratio 6. 14 were made at Mach numbers ranging from 0. 20 to 0. 75. The model was centrally mounted on a 9 -percent-thick airfoil and was designed to have an efficient airfoil-body juncture and a high critical speed. An air inlet at the nose and various outlets at the tail were added: drag and internal-flow data were obtained over the given speed range. The critical speed of the <b>ducted</b> <b>bodies</b> was found to be as high as that of the streamline body. The external - drag with air flow through the body did not exceed the drag of the basic streamline shape.

The effects of this testing resulted in softened front end contours, removal of drip troughs and helped shaped internal air flow <b>ducting.</b> <b>Body</b> engineering in the Aspen was executed using computer technology; unit body engineering was conducted by use of clear plastic stress models that showed up stress points before any sheet metal was formed. Weight reduction to provide maximum fuel economy was achieved through use of thinner glass, lighter weight side door beams and HSLA brackets and reinforcements that were four times as strong as conventional mild steel. A reduced number of stampings resulted in better panel fits and fewer welds.

40|$|A solar {{ejection}} {{passed the}} Wind spacecraft between December 23 and 26, 1996. On closer examination, {{we find a}} sequence of ejecta material, as identified by abnormally low proton temperatures, separated by plasmas with typical solar wind temperatures at 1 AU. Large and abrupt changes in field and plasma properties occurred near the separation boundaries of these regions. At the one boundary we examine here, a series of directional discontinuities was observed. We argue that Alfvenic fluctuations {{in the immediate vicinity}} of these discontinuities distort minimum variance normals, introducing uncertainty into the identification of the discontinuities as either rotational or tangential. Carrying out a series of tests on plasma and field data including minimum variance, velocity and magnetic field correlations, and jump conditions, we conclude that the discontinuities are tangential. Furthermore, we find waves superposed on these tangential discontinuities (TDs). The presence of discontinuities allows the existence of both surface waves and <b>ducted</b> <b>body</b> waves. Both probably form in the solar atmosphere where many transverse nonuniformities exist and where theoretically they have been expected. We add to prior speculation that waves on discontinuities may in fact be a common occurrence. In the solar wind, these waves can attain large amplitudes and low frequencies. We argue that such waves can generate dynamical changes at TDs through advection or forced reconnection. The dynamics might so extensively alter the internal structure that the discontinuity would no longer be identified as tangential. Such processes could help explain why the occurrence frequency of TDs observed throughout the solar wind falls off with increasing heliocentric distance. The presence of waves may also alter the nature of the interactions of TDs with the Earth's bow shock in so-called hot flow anomalies...|$|R

40|$|The {{anterior}} adhesive mechanism was {{studied for}} Merizocotyle icopae (Monogenea: Monocotylidae). Adult anterior apertures can open and close. In addition, duct endings terminating within the apertures are everted or retracted {{depending on the}} stage of attachment. Adhesive in adults is synthesized from all 3 secretory types (rod-shaped, small and large spheroidal bodies) found within anterior apertures. All exit together and undergo mixing to produce the adhesive matrix, a process that depletes duct contents. A greater number of <b>ducts</b> carrying rod-shaped <b>bodies</b> is depleted than <b>ducts</b> containing spheroidal <b>bodies</b> which changes the ratio of secretory types present on detachment. Detachment involves elongation of duct endings and secretion of additional matrix as the worm pulls away from the substrate. The change in secretory type ratio putatively modifies the properties of the secreted matrix enabling detachment. Only after detachment do ducts refill. During attachment, individual secretory bodies undergo morphological changes. The larval and adult adhesive matrix differs. Anterior adhesive in oncomiracidia does not show fibres with banding whereas banded fibres comprise a large part of adult adhesive. The data suggest that this is the result of adult spheroidal secretions modifying {{the way in which the}} adult adhesive matrix forms. B. W. Cribb, W. D. Armstrong and I. D. Whittingto...|$|R

5000|$|The term {{is derived}} from the Greek words sialon (saliva) and lithos (stone), and the Latin -iasis meaning [...] "process" [...] or [...] "morbid condition". A {{calculus}} (plural calculi) is a hard, stone-like concretion that forms within an organ or <b>duct</b> inside the <b>body.</b> They are usually made from mineral salts, and other types of calculi include tonsiloliths (tonsil stones) and renal calculi (kidney stones). Sialolithiasis refers to the formation of calculi within a salivary gland. If a calculus forms in the duct that drains the saliva from a salivary gland into the mouth, then saliva will be trapped in the gland. This may cause painful swelling and inflammation of the gland. Inflammation of a salivary gland is termed sialadenitis. Inflammation associated with blockage of the duct is sometimes termed [...] "obstructive sialadenitis". Because saliva is stimulated to flow more with the thought, sight or smell of food, or with chewing, pain and swelling will often get suddenly worse just before and during a meal ("peri-prandial"), and then slowly decrease after eating, this is termed meal time syndrome. However, calculi are not the only reasons that a salivary gland may become blocked and give rise to the meal time syndrome. Obstructive salivary gland disease, or obstructive sialadenitis, may also occur due to fibromucinous plugs, <b>duct</b> stenosis, foreign <b>bodies,</b> anatomic variations, or malformations of the duct system leading to a mechanical obstruction associated with stasis of saliva in the duct.|$|R
40|$|Supersonic flow over a downstream-facing {{step on the}} {{circumference}} of a large, <b>ducted,</b> axisymmetric <b>body</b> was used to study flow reattachment. Step heights h were 0. 25, 1. 00, and 1. 68 in., compared to a body radius of 6 in. Freestream Mach numbers were in the range 2 to 4. 5. Theturbulent boundary-layer thickness {{just ahead of the}} step varied from 0. 14 to 0. 19 in. (momentum thicknesses of about 0. 01 in.). Surface pressure distributions throughout the region of separation and reattachment were measured, and points of reattachment were determined. Comparison of the shapes of the pressure distributions for various step heights shows that the initial (steepest) parts of the reattachment pressure rise, up to the point of reattachment, tend to become superimposed when plotted against x/h. Downstream reattachment the curves branch out, exhibiting a dependence on geometry and probably on initial shear layer profile. In the region of the initial pressure rise (near the end of the "dead air" region) dynamic pressures are low; the pressure rise there apparently is balanced by turbulent shear stress...|$|R

As a rule of thumb, arc size of the <b>ducts</b> decreases with <b>body</b> mass and consequently slower angular head motions. Arc size increases with greater agility and thus more rapid head motions. Modern humans have bigger arcs on their anterior and posterior canals, which reflect greater angular motion along the sagittal plane.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the biliary tree are infrequently reported {{with the exception of}} sclerosing cholangitis. These conditions, especially when affecting the common bile duct (CBD), can be mistaken for tumours; their existence should be considered in the differential diagnosis of biliary lesions and, in particular, biliary strictures. Few descriptions of inflammatory conditions exist in the published literature. METHODS: A comprehensive search was undertaken of the last 20 years of published literature. RESULTS: Potential aetiological factors include infection, infestation, traumatic bile <b>duct</b> injury, foreign <b>body</b> or gallstone reaction and the host inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: These conditions typically mimic malignant tumours of the CBD but knowledge of the aforementioned processes might alter the surgical approach to biliary strictures (especially after previous cholecystectomy), with greater emphasis on surgical exploration...|$|R

40|$|Vasopressin-regulated water {{reabsorption}} {{through the}} water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) in renal collecting <b>ducts</b> maintains <b>body</b> water homeostasis. Vasopressin activates PKA, which phosphorylates AQP 2, and this phosphorylation event is required to increase the water permeability and water reabsorption of the collecting duct cells. It has been established that the phosphorylation of AQP 2 induces its apical membrane insertion, rendering the cell water-permeable. However, whether this phosphorylation regulates the water permeability of this channel still remains unclear. To clarify the role of AQP 2 phosphorylation in water permeability, we expressed recombinant human AQP 2 in Escherichia coli, purified it, and reconstituted it into proteoliposomes. AQP 2 proteins not reconstituted into liposomes were removed by fractionating on density step gradients. AQP 2 -reconstituted liposomes were then extruded through polycarbonate filters to obtain unilamellar vesicles. PKA phosphorylation significantly increased the osmotic water permeability of AQP 2 -reconstituted liposomes. We then examined the roles of AQP 2 phosphorylation at Ser- 256 and Ser- 261 in the regulation of water permeability using phosphorylation mutants reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The water permeability of the non-phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S 256 A-AQP 2 and non-phosphorylated WT-AQP 2 was similar, {{and that of the}} phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S 256 D-AQP 2 and phosphorylated WT-AQP 2 was similar. The water permeability of S 261 A-AQP 2 and S 261 D-AQP 2 was similar to that of non-phosphorylated WT-AQP 2.

However, {{it is unclear}} if these genes are necessary {{for the maintenance of}} cellular differentiation after development. We identified GATA- 3 as the most highly enriched transcription factor in the mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. GATA- 3 was found in the luminal cells of mammary <b>ducts</b> and the <b>body</b> cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). Upon conditional deletion of GATA- 3, mice exhibited severe defects in mammary development due to failure in TEB formation during puberty. After acute GATA- 3 loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase-mediated cell death in the long term. Further, FOXA 1 was identified as a downstream target of GATA- 3 in the mammary gland.

A brief review of bile <b>duct</b> foreign <b>bodies</b> and gallstones is presented. KEY WORDS: Choledocholithiasis, foreign bodies, endoscopic therapy CASE REPORT A 48 year old female with a history of biliary colic underwent uneventful cholecystectomy in 1979 for gallstones. She was well until November 1988 when she presented with several days of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A HIDA Scan indicated complete obstruction of the common bile duct (CBD). Liver function tests (LFT’s) were consistent with obstruction and the amylase was significantly elevated. The symptoms subsided spontaneously with conservative management and repeat HIDA scan was normal. The presumptive diagnosis was biliary pancreatitis with spontaneous passage of a stone. One year later she presented with nausea, excruciating abdominal pain, fever and mild jaundice. Again, HIDA scan showed complete obstruction of the CBD, LFT’s were obstructive but the amylase was normal. She had a leukocytosis and blood cultures grew sensitive coliform bacteria. She was treated with ampicillin with a good response. Three days later she was referred to Duke University Medical Center for further evaluation and treatment.
