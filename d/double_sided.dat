25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. Double-sided disks could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{manufacturers}} introduced smaller floppy drives and media in various formats. A consortium of 21 companies eventually settled on a 3½-inch floppy disk (actually 90mm wide) a.k.a. Micro diskette, Micro disk, or Micro floppy, similar to a Sony design but improved to support both single-sided and double-sided media, with formatted capacities generally of 360 KB and 720 KB respectively.

25|$|Narcotics Anonymous {{members are}} not {{required}} to pay any dues or fees. NA is committed to being fully self-supporting, declining any outside contributions. Group expenses are covered entirely by voluntary contributions from its members. Groups meet costs such as meeting room rental, tea and coffee, and any literature that the group provides for free from these contributions, after which surplus funds are passed to the service structure. Group often provide some literature items such as IPs (<b>Double</b> <b>sided</b> single sheet pamphlets) and keytags/chips celebrating clean time. Area Service Committees are typically funded from Group contributions plus money raised by events such as dances and recovery events attended by members. In some countries Area committees also supply literature to the Groups. Areas pass funds on to the Regions, which can also receive contributions from Groups and also raise money though conventions attended by hundreds to thousands {{and tens of thousands of}} members. Regions also sometimes run Regional Service Offices which buy literature from the World Service Office and its branch offices for sale to Areas and Groups. Because Regional Service Offices can purchase in bulk and sell at list price sometimes this surplus exceeds the running costs of the office. Regions then pass funds to Zonal Forums and also the World Service Conference via the World Service Office according to the decision of the Region.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the realization of}} the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) -like transmission in a metamaterial plasma waveguide with <b>double</b> <b>side</b> defects based on transmission lines. The waveguide with a single side defect works as a plasma resonator and the resonance wavelength is determined by the Fabry-Perot resonance of surface plasma. While in a waveguide with <b>double</b> <b>side</b> defects, a transmission peak appears between the two resonators frequencies because of the destructive interference between the resonance modes of the two resonators, which indicates a pronounced EIT phenomenon. The experiment results agree well with simulations in microwave frequencies...|$|R
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with <b>double</b> <b>sides</b> adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. <b>Double</b> <b>sides</b> also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending fatigue {{is one of}} {{the main}} failure modes of gears. The method of gear fatigue design was {{discussed}} in many papers. Most of them are based on GB/T 3480 - 83. But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single side loaded gear. For <b>double</b> <b>sides</b> loaded gear, only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single side loaded gear. A new formula based on fatigue theory is given to modify the mean stress in consideration of the load character of <b>doubled</b> <b>sides</b> loaded gear. The method given in the paper is an addition to the traditional gear design method...|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>side</b> {{collecting}} silicon {{solar cells}} {{such as the}} emitter wrap through and the both sides contacted and collecting concept are one possibility to maintain high efficiencies even on low lifetime material. To investigate the intrinsic advantages and limitations of this concept we use {{the solution of the}} continuity equation under low level injection conditions for a <b>double</b> <b>side</b> collecting (n+pn+) and a single side collecting (n +pp+) solar cell. In general, compared to the single side collecting structure, the <b>double</b> <b>side</b> collecting structure yields the highest advantages concerning the product of the short circuit current density and the open circuit voltage Jsc·Voc on highly doped material with diffusion lengths in the range of half the cell thickness. A realistic calculation of the fill factor of such devices is done using two dimensional numerical simulations. It is shown that a major reduction of the fill factor is caused by laterally varying voltage induced non- generation losses and ohmic losses, both caused by the majority carrier flow in the base. Electro- and photoluminescence images verify and illustrate the lateral voltage distribution under different illumination levels and terminal voltages...|$|R
