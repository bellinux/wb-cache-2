50|$|Caterpillars {{can usually}} be found on young adult leaves between October and March (the Australian Spring and Summer). When the {{caterpillars}} hatch they are black with short hairs on top of small nodes on their bodies called tubercles. The hairs are not poisonous and will not sting. As the caterpillars mature they change color each time they shed their skin (which totals to five stages in the caterpillar's appearance). The fully grown caterpillars are usually found on the highest branches of the host tree where the leaves are the youngest and easiest to digest. By the final stage before pupation the caterpillars have developed striking coloration, having a yellow/cream stripe down their bright green/blue body and nodes of red and blue. Despite this they are still surprisingly hard to spot. The caterpillar stage in the <b>emperor</b> <b>gum</b> <b>moth's</b> life cycle can last for many weeks, depending on the temperature and weather conditions.|$|R

40|$|The autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> Mnesampela privata (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), is {{native to}} Australia and can be a pest of {{plantation}} eucalypts. Field-collected and laboratory-reared female autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moths</b> were dissected to remove glands likely to contain components of the sex pheromone. Using gas chromatography (GC) and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), three compounds were identified from female extracts, namely (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene, 1 -hexadecanol and 1 -octadecanol (confirmed by comparison with synthetic samples). Nonadecatriene elicited an antennal response in male autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> during gas chromatographic analyses combined with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). In electroantennogram (EAG) recording male M. privata antennae responded to the nonadecatriene. Nonadecatriene was synthesised via Kolbe electrolysis, starting with (9 Z, 12 Z, 15 Z) -octadeca- 9, 12, 15 -trienoic acid (linolenic acid) and propanoic acid or via an alternative four-step method also starting from linolenic acid. In field trials (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene proved attractive to male moths. Thus, we conclude that (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene is a sex pheromone component of autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth.</b> This component has been identified in extracts from other geometrids in the same subfamily, Ennominae. However, to our knowledge {{this is the first}} example where (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene has been found in females and also proved attractive to male moths when presented on its own. Our results are discussed in relation to other geometrid pheromones...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the association between resistance of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. to autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> (Mnesempala privata Guenée) defoliation and cuticular wax compounds. In a field trial consisting of clonally replicated F 2 families of E. globulus, situated in Tasmania, Australia, significant genetic variation in resistance was detected in two of three F 2 families. The broad-sense heritability for defoliation within families ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 33. The 15 most resistant and the 15 most susceptible genotypes within each variable family were compared for their relative levels of 26 cuticular wax compounds. While no significant correlation between resistance and total wax yield estimates was found, significant differences were detected between resistant and susceptible classes in the relative quantities of several aliphatic phenylethyl and benzyl wax esters within both families. This association {{does not appear to}} be a response induced by defoliation. The broad-sense heritabilities of the variation in these compounds were high (0. 82 - 0. 94). Our findings suggest that these wax compounds are a mechanism of genetic resistance to autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> in E. globulus...|$|R

40|$|The Autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> Mnesampela privata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) is an endemic Australian moth whose larvae {{feed upon}} species of Eucalyptus. The moths {{favorite}} host plants are E. globulus and E. nitens {{which are the}} most important species used in commercial plantations of the Australian pulpwood industry. The autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> {{has become one of the}} most significant outbreak insects of eucalyptus plantations throughout Australia. As a consequence great financial losses to the forest industry occur. Today insecticides such as pyrethroids are used for control of eucalyptus defoliators as M. privata. The carrot psyllid, Trioza apicalis (Homoptera: Psylloidea), is one of the major pests of carrot (Daucus carota) in northern Europe. The psyllid causes curling of the carrot leafs and reduction of plant growth. Today the carrot crops are protected with the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin, which is toxic to aquatic organisms and is, from 2010, prohibited for use in Sweden by the Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate. An alternative to insecticides is to protect the seedlings with semiochemicals, a chemical substance or mixture of them that carries a message. This thesis describes the identification and the syntheses of semiochemicals from the above mentioned insect species. From analysis of abdominal tip extracts of M. privata females from Tasmania a blend of (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene and (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -heneicosatriene was identified as the sex pheromone of this species. The identification of the C 19 - and C 21 -trienes was confirmed by synthesis. In the analysis of carrot leaf extracts we found a compound, α-cis-bergamotene, that induces antennal response in the carrot psyllid. This is just the beginning of the studies of trying to manipulate this psyllid with semiochemicals instead of insecticides...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{damage to}} {{production}} forests {{has the potential}} to reduce financial returns by retarding tree growth and causing mortality, however, long-term realised quantification of these losses is rare. In order to help elucidate economic damage thresholds for making spray decisions we capitalised on a natural outbreak of autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> Mnesampela privata, in a 2 -year-old Eucalyptus nitens plantation. Following the partial chemical control of this insect outbreak we measured the tree growth variables diameter at breast height over bark and height of five differing tree defoliation classes for 75 months following tree damage. At the end of this period a thresholdmodel was fitted to describe the relationship between tree defoliation and realised tree wood volumes. The model revealed that realised stand wood volume was not significantly affected up until defoliation exceeded 60...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century, several endemic Australian {{eucalypt}} insects have established {{around the world}} as serious pests. Some, such as the cerambycid beetle Phoracantha semipunctata, have invaded almost all eucalypt-growing regions of the world (with the notable exception of Asia), while others such as the gum leaf skeletoniser, Uraba lugens, have been one-off introductions restricted to a particular country or region. Nearly all these insects were not signifi cant pests in Australian natural forest or plantations prior to their establishment overseas. Moreover, the most serious recent overseas introductions have been insects that were previously unrecorded in Australia or were poorly known, rare, and of limited distribution (Leptocybe invasa and Thaumastocoris peregrinus). However, none of the most common and damaging pests of eucalypt plantations in Australia, such as the chrysomelid leaf beetles Paropsisterna bimaculata, P. agricola, and Paropsis atomaria; the autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> Mnesampela privata; or stem borers such as Endoxyla cinerea, Phoracantha solida, and P. acanthocera have established overseas. We examine reasons why these more serious pests have not yet become pests on eucalypts overseas, and examine whether historical trends of establishment and pathway analysis can be used to predict future movements of eucalypt-invasive insects worldwide...|$|R

We examine the robustnessof this association {{by comparing the}} {{abundance of}} theimplicated foliar wax compounds with defoliation levels inthree plantation sites and a genetics trial in northernTasmania. At all locations,the aliphatic alkanoate,benzyln-tetracosanoate (C 24),was found in significantly higherabundance in the foliar wax of E. globulustrees that haddisplayed low M. privatadamage (designated resistant) compared to trees that had displayed high damage (designatedsusceptible). Further,when sites were combined,benzyln-tetracosanoate (C 24) accounted for 16 % of variation infield defoliation. Field defoliation was also positively corre-lated to M. privataoviposition both {{in the field and}} onfoliage sprigs in a cage. In the cage bioassay,ovipositionaccounted for 20 % of variation in field defoliationmaking it a better predictor of tree defoliation in the fieldthan either field oviposition,which accounted for 9 % ofvariation,or screening foliage for the abundance of benzyln-tetracosanoate (C 24). Despite both benzyl n-tetracosanoate(C 24) and oviposition being related to field defoliation,therewas no statistically significant relationship between theabundance of benzyl n-tetracosanoate (C 24) and ovipositionin the field or cage bioassay. Further work is thereforerequired to determine if increased levels of this compound inthe foliar wax operates as a direct deterrent to M. privataoviposition...|$|R
40|$|The autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> Mnesampela privata Guenée {{is a major}} {{defoliator}} of Australia’s commercially important pulpwood plantation species, Eucalyptus globulus Labill. However, {{little is}} known about genetic variability of E. globulus to M. privata oviposition preference. We examined oviposition preference by exposing juvenile foliage sprigs of different genetic origins to gravid female moths in cage bioassays. Foliage sprigs were collected from 40 E. globulus families grown in a common environment field trial in southern Tasmania. These families were derived from open-pollinated seed collected in native stands and represented four geographic races of E. globulus. Significant differences in the level of oviposition was detected between foliage sprigs from the different races, with those from the Furneaux race receiving over twice as many egg batches compared to those from either the Strzelecki Ranges or northeastern Tasmania races. The southern Tasmania race received an intermediate egg load. No significant variability in oviposition preference was identified between different localities within races or between different open-pollinated families within localities. Selections from both the Strzelecki Ranges and Furneaux races comprise a large component of the Australian E. globulus breeding population. There is therefore likely to be significant genetic variation for M. privata oviposition preference within the breeding population and by screening before deployment gains in plantation productivity in areas subject to M. privata outbreaks may be possible...|$|R
40|$|Common {{potato scab}} affects potato farmers {{worldwide}} and costs the Tasmanian potato farming industry approximately 5 {{million dollars a}} year. The disease is caused in white potatoes by the common soil bacterium streptomyces scabies, from which several secondary metabolites have been isolated; these are known as the thaxtomin class of phytotoxins. These compounds {{have been shown to}} cause scabs in potatoes in sterile conditions and are phytotoxic to cellulose based plants. Several approaches to the total synthesis of the thaxtomins have been investigated. The most successful proceeds via the synthesis of 4 -nitrotryptophan, followed by peptide coupling and cyclisation to give two of the three dehydroxy-thaxtomins. Other routes starting from glycine anhydride using condensation chemistry to build the three ring system have provided a series of analogues for structure activity testing. Toxicity of the analogues and synthetic thaxtomins has been analysed using Arabidopsis thaliana. Two analogues showed activity approaching thaxtomin A and show promise as potential new herbicides. Non-toxic analogues have been tested for their ability to ameliorate or negate the effects of thaxtomin A using a variety of models. These compounds provide a possible solution to the scab problem. Current methods for the synthesis of the pyrrolidine antibiotic anisomycin are complicated and rely on the preparation of a 3 -pyrroline intermediate. Two novel methods to target this advanced intermediate are discussed, firstly use of a Zn/HCI reduction of a a-ketopyrrole, and secondly the reduction of N-tosyl pyrroles with TFA/NaCNBH 3. The use of N-toysl protected 3 -pyrrolines as building blocks towards hydroxyl substituted pyrrolidines is also explored. Synthesis of gram quantities of the C 19 and C 21 triene sex pheromones of the autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth</b> (Mnesampe/a private) has proved difficult because of the tendency of the trienes to decompose through auto oxidation. We present an approach to the synthesis of these compounds by spiking the starting material with the antioxidant BHT and carrying it through the reaction scheme. This enables a significant improvement in the overall yield of the desired product, which increased from 20...|$|R
40|$|Molecular markers {{are being}} applied {{increasingly}} to {{various aspects of}} tree improvement. This thesis reports two such applications. The first involves tracing the natural origins and assessing the genetic diversity of the Portuguese Landrace of E. globulus, which is a core component of the Portuguese breeding program. In order to achieve this, variation in chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence and microsatellite allele frequency in 47 individuals of the Portuguese Landrace were compared with native stand material. The native gene pool of E. globulus is genetically diverse, with substantial geographically structured genetic variation in molecular markers, which {{makes it possible to}} trace the origin of germplasm of unknown pedigree, such as the Portuguese Landrace. Similar affinities suggested by the two independent marker systems provided strong evidence that the Portuguese Landrace was predominantly derived from south-eastern Tasmania {{and to a lesser extent}} south-eastern Victoria. Ascertaining the origin of and diversity in such populations will help to avoid inbreeding and will capture the most favourable traits from native populations when they are used in breeding programs. The second application of molecular markers addressed in this thesis involved the construction of a genetic linkage map and searching for molecular markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) in E. globulus. This study focussed on identifying QTL for susceptibility to Mycosphaerella leaf blotch (MLB), a fungal disease affecting the growth of eucalypt plantations worldwide, and other potentially correlated traits. In order to search for QTL, parental and consensus linkage maps were constructed in an F 2 inter-provenance cross of Eucalyptus globulus with clonal replication. The consensus map used for QTL detection contained 169 markers (34 SSR and 135 AFLP loci) in 11 linkage groups. The inclusion of SSR markers allowed comparison of linkage and QTL information to other mapping and QTL studies conducted in different mapping pedigrees of E. globulus and other species in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus. The F 2 was genetically variable, with significant differences detected between genotypes for all recorded traits. Significant QTL were detected for susceptibility to MLB, herbivory by the autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> growth and vegetative phase change. In the case of MLB susceptibility, two major unlinked QTL explained over 70...|$|R
40|$|The autumn <b>gum</b> <b>moth,</b> Mnesampela privata, {{utilizes}} {{several species}} of Eucalyptus planted outside regions of endemism within Australia. We investigated whether foliar monoterpene composition influenced oviposition in the field on the natural primary host (E. globulus) and a novel host (E. rubida), both characterized by nonstructural epicuticular waxes. In the laboratory, oviposition preferences of females for species and families of known host, novel hosts, and non-hosts that were characterized by both nonstructural and structural waxes but also varied in foliar concentrations of the purportedly toxic plant secondary metabolite (sideroxylonal) were studied. Although M. privata laid as many eggs on trees of two families of E. rubida as they did on trees of two families of E. globulus, {{there were significant differences}} in the numbers of clutches of eggs laid. When combined with data for oviposition on another five families of E. globulus, we found a negative relationship between mean numbers of eggs and foliar concentration of alpha-pinene but a positive relationship between egg numbers and the concentration of alpha-terpineol. The field data suggest that female M. privata are just as willing to lay eggs on novel hosts with comparable foliar monoterpene compositions to those of the primary host, especially if they produce nonstructural epicuticular waxes. Oviposition assays in the laboratory endorse this mechanism of host plant hierarchy and support the long-held assumption of the host primacy of E. globulus. In laboratory assays, some larvae pupated on all hosts (except Corymbia eximia) but the number completing larval development was greater on hosts with softer leaves. Larval survival was also reduced on hosts with high concentrations of sideroxylonal but only if those hosts also had modest to high concentrations of monoterpenes. Larval survival was high on a host (E. macarthurii) with a high concentration of sideroxylonal but with virtually zero monoterpene content. This suggests that the monoterpene content of a host could antagonize the effect on M. privata larvae of its sideroxylonal content. The larval food plant most affected the fitness of female rather than male pupae. Of the known host expansion events, all have occurred in mixed species plantations. The co-occurrence in these plantations of either the primary host or other highly ranked species probably explains the eventual expansion onto the neighboring species of Eucalyptus and Corymbia...|$|R
