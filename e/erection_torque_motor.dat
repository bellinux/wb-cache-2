The main object of study of this paper is moving iron permanent magnet <b>torque</b> <b>motor.</b> The dynamic characteristics of <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> are the key parameter to measure the overall performance. At present, the research of most of manufacturers emphasize on the test of integral valve servo valve. <b>Torque</b> <b>motor</b> is also designed to mimic the structure and size of foreign-based valve, lacking of system understanding for characteristics of servo valve. Early in the design, people cannot effectively control the overall performance of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> products. There is large performance difference with a larger group of <b>torque</b> <b>motor,</b> producing serious waste.

40|$|A <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> is {{a special}} {{electric}} motor that {{is able to develop}} the highest possible torque in a certain volume. A <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> usually has a pancake configuration, and is directly jointed to a drive system (without a gear box). A limited angle <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> is a <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> that has no rotary electromagnetic field — in certain papers it is referred to as a linear electromagnet. The main intention of the authors for this paper is to present a means for analyzing and designing a limited angle <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> only through the finite element method. Users nowadays require very high-performance limited angle <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> with high density torque. It is therefore necessary to develop the highest possible torque in a relatively small volume. A way to design such motors is by using numerical methods based on the finite element method...|$|R

On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of winding drive system’s technological requirements of multi-wire cutting system and the characteristics of <b>torque</b> <b>motor,</b> the article proposes a scheme of wrap wheel with <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> control to overcome the deficiency of the general control motor driven wrap wheel.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} an {{innovative}} drive concept for robots {{to improve their}} machining capability is presented. As a test bed a two-axis robot is designed and equipped with <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> with load-sided high resolution encoders in addition to conventional gear motors with harmonic drive gearboxes.

40|$|As a key {{component}} of hydraulic control systems, hydraulic servovalves influence their performance significantly. Unpredictable self-excited noise inside hydraulic servovalves may cause instability and even failure. Being functional, with higher saturation magnetization and increased viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field, magnetic fluids (MFs) have been widely used in dampers, sealing, and biomedical treatment. In this paper, magnetic fluids are applied in the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> of a hydraulic servovalve to exert damping and resistance for vibration and noise suppression. Construction of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> armature with magnetic fluids is introduced and the forces due to magnetic fluids on the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> armature are studied. Based on a bi-viscosity-constituted relationship, a mathematical model of the damping force from magnetic fluids is built when magnetic fluids are filled in the working gaps of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor.</b> Measurements of the properties of an Fe 3 O 4 composite magnetic fluid are carried out to calculate the parameters of this mathematical model and to investigate the influence of magnetic fluids on the vibration characteristics of the armature assembly. The simulated and tested harmonic responses of the armature with and without magnetic fluids show the good suppression effects of magnetic fluids on the self-excited noise inside the servovalve...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{considers}} {{servo valve}} <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> having four air-gaps. An ideal for {{these types of}} <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> is to have four equal air-gaps at free state. However, real servo valve <b>torque</b> <b>motors</b> have unequal air-gaps due to production errors. Because {{the influence of the}} inequality of air-gaps is not clear, servo valve manufacturers have made great efforts to establish the equality of the air-gaps. The current paper gives a prospect on how an imbalance of air-gaps changes the flux densities in the air-gaps and the resultant torque characteristic. An important result of the paper {{is that some of the}} air-gap imbalance induces a torque change of magnitude of second- or higher-powers of the imbalance. The imbalance of the air-gaps due to different pole heights results in an offset proportional to the magnitude of the imbalance. These results can be used for setting a tolerance limit for air-gap thickness...|$|R

40|$|Where {{the complex}} form shapes of work pieces require five-axes {{machining}} in highest precision, the machine {{systems that are}} available on the market, are often limited in their accuracy (spatial positioning accuracy < 10 mym). In previous enquiries, the five-axes machining accuracy was identified as limiting factor for the high precision manufacturing of complex micro parts for high end applications. Especially the rotary axes of conventional five-axes machine design affect the machine accuracy significantly. For this reason the Fraunhofer IPT initiated a research project focusing on the reduction of the rotational axis error by implementing an integral design strategy consequently. A concept has been developed integrating hydrostatic bearings into a <b>torque</b> <b>motor.</b> Therefore electrotechnical as well as mechanical issues have been worked out following the integral resolution method for increasing the five-axes accuracy. Focusing on the reduction of the error activating cantilevers caused by the rotary axes, a concept has been worked out integrating hydrostatic bearings into a <b>torque</b> <b>motor.</b> Thereby, a radial bearing is integrated into the air gap of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> while two axial bearings are positioned in-between the work piece table and the face side of the motor. Following the integral design idea principally, the bearing pockets are integrated into the primary part of the drive and the counter bearing surfaces are provided by the work piece table, the motor's face side and the circumference of the rotor. The integration of the radial hydrostatic bearing changes the electro-magnetical, the mechanical as well as the thermal conditions of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor</b> although the bearing behaviour will be affected by the mechanical stiffness (gap variation) and by the temperature (gap variation and oil viscosity) of the <b>torque</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|R
