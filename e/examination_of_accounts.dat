But, in order firmly to {{establish}} the precedent of payment previous to account, and to form it into a settled rule of the House, the god in the machine was brought down, nothing less than the wonder-working law of Parliament. It was alleged, that it is the law of Parliament, when any demand comes from the crown, that the House must go immediately into the committee of supply; in which committee it was allowed, that the production and <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> would be quite proper and regular. It was therefore carried, that they should go into the committee without delay, and without accounts, in order to examine with great order and regularity things that could not possibly come before them. After this stroke of orderly and Parliamentary wit and humor, they went into the committee; and very generously voted the payment.|$|E

The {{study on}} {{accounts}} examines how people {{account for the}} activities and experiences through our personal stories emanating from how they behave in the community, {{and because of the}} past stories they tell. The study thus provides an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> as well as account-giving. It provides a scientific understanding of the value and impact of personal stories and story-telling in people’s lives. The problem experienced in relation to accounts relates to how accounts impact on people and vice versa. One hypotheses of this study on accounts relates {{to the nature of the}} process associated with people’s presentation of personal account to others. The aims and objectives of this study crucially relate to providing an analysis and understanding of accounts. The research method used in this study provides a basis to the analysis and understanding of accounts in the sense that individuals who were interviewed in the process, provided informative accounts of their childhood stories, some of whom were not aware that they have or had an impact on their daily lives. The main findings of the research provide insights into accounts. The findings are informative and contribute to theory development as regard account-giving, including factors relating to deference and respect. The recommendation that given in this work is that personal stories have a scientific merit in terms of a comunication-theoretic approach to narratives, as shown in the study...|$|E
40|$|The part {{played by}} warshipbuilding in {{sustaining}} the Clyde shipbuilding industry between 1889 and 1939 has received less attention than it deserves. Only {{a minority of}} firms undertook warshipbuilding in peacetime but they included some of the leading shipyards an the Clyde. This study, based on a detailed <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> and cost records, shows that naval work was of critical importance for these firms from the 1890 's onwards. All of the firms which {{took advantage of the}} expansion in the demand for warships in the 1890 's were in financial difficulties and profitable naval contracts were largely responsible for reviving their fortunes. From then until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, naval work constituted a major part of their output and the most profitable part of it. By 19149 all of the warshipbuilders had expanded their capacity and provided expensive new facilities largely an the strength of the demand for warships and the three biggest yards were owned by armaments manufacturers who were primarily interested in shipyards for their warshipbuilding capability. After the war, the demand for armaments contracted and the warshipbuilders were faced with the problem of finding profitable employment for capacity designed for building warships and warship engines. This proved to be impossible and the relative dearth of naval contracts in the 1920 's and early 1930 's was the primary cause of the severe financial difficulties in which they found themselves when the onset of the world financial crisis in 1931 brought merchant shipbuilding to a standstill. Only Beardmore's succumbed but, had rearmament not been in the offing, it is doubtful if many of the warshipbuilding yards would have survived the ensuing crisis. As it was the survivors regained their financial stability by 1939 only because of the revival in the demand for warships...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of cultural values on accounting uniformity and consistency among Arabic nations. Design/methodology/approach – A combination of a survey and analysis of published data on accounting information. Cluster analysis is used to classify the countries on the basis <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> consistency and uniformity. Findings – The study indicates that the Hofstede-Gray hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> uniformity in Arab countries is supported by actual <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> practice. Research limitations/implications – This is an initial study and the results need to be confirmed in future research. Nevertheless, the finding should be of interested to global investors, international accounting organizations (e. g. IFAC) and other academics who are researching accounting in the Middle East. Practical implications – The study indicates that in Arabic nations with a Muslim majority, cultural factors affect accounting development generally and accounting uniformity particularly. The study also shows that accounting practice in Saudi Arabia is less strict in term of uniformity in comparison with other Arabic countries. Originality/value – The paper is one of the few attempting to assess the effects <b>of</b> culture on <b>accounting</b> uniformity in the Middle East. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an in-depth <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism, {{which is one}} of the oldest and most important principles <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> (Sterling, 1967;Watts, 2003 a). Two main questions relating to accounting conservatism are extensively studied in this thesis: (1) How to measure accounting conservatism? (2) Why do firms adopt accounting conservatism? This thesis consists of three main chapters that answer these two questions from three different perspectives. The first chapter studies the existing empirical measures <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism from a construct validity perspective and concludes that construct validity of the existing measures is mixed to low. The second chapter examines the validity and bias in the Basu (1997) measure <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism - one of the most widely used measure of conservatism in the accounting literature. The second chapter shows, analytically and empirically, that the Basu (1997) measure is biased upwards by the default risk of a firm, and proposes a new measure of conservatism that is free from this bias. This new measure of conservatism is called the "Default-Adjusted-Basu" measure. The third chapter investigates the economic rationale for accounting conservatism, and proposes a signalling theory for accounting conservatism. In a debt market characterized by information asymmetry, a borrower firm's degree of conservatism can serve as a credible signal about that borrower firm's level of operating risk to the lenders in the debt market. Thus, one potential benefit <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism is that it can reduce the degree of information asymmetry in the debt market...|$|R

Notwithstanding that it has grown from historical record-keeping to a functional position indispensable {{in the conduct of}} business, today 1 s era of accelerated technological achievement and industrial expansion places continued challenging demands for accounting research leading to still more valuable contributions. An <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> association, publications provides ample evidence of professional interest in such research. From the matrix <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> self appraisal, dissatisfaction, investigation and trial, there have been many business oriented concepts or techniques generated which have found their way into acceptable accounting procedure. One that is in such transition today is direct costing. In past years accounting techniques have become increasingly complex, obscuring simple cost, volume, and profit relationships. Meanwhile, the tremendous technological strides in industry have resulted in the placement of many engineers, scientists, and other non-financially trained persons in top management positions. As a result of these trends, many of today 1 s executives do not fully understand accounting methods and the resultant information which comprise some of their tools for decision-making. The need exists for accounting systems which are simple and show fundamental relationships readily. Direct costing fulfills these requirements...|$|R
