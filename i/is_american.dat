5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>American</b> assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the video}} games, Kyo has made {{appearances}} which met disapproval by critics. Lucas M.

Bison to also kill himself to search Iori.

Beyond Hollywood was also confused by Kyo's portrayal in the film due to flashbacks of his childhood featuring him as Japanese whereas his adult self <b>is</b> <b>American.</b>|$|E
