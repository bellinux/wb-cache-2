5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of}} the session.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group. Celtic played Inter Milan {{in the last}} 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3–3 at Parkhead from an early 0–2 deficit in a pulsating encounter, then losing 1–0 in Milan to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on aggregate despite a highly credible performance.|$|E

5|$|In a noisy print shop, a disgraced {{police detective}} named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from {{pursuing}} criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically {{that he has}} discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose {{the identity of the}} responsible criminal, the lights <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at Professor Baum's asylum.|$|E
5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and {{discipline of the}} soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered in a fashion that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{to the families of}} the fallen soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The Concert for Bangladesh {{was first}} issued on CD on 30 July 1991 in America and 19 August in Britain. It was {{presented}} as a two-disc set, with significant editing of the breaks between songs.

5|$|The England manager {{may also}} involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues. The England manager is {{expected}} to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system that surrounds the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign.

60|$|So, at {{the time}} appointed, betimes in the morning, the captains <b>went</b> <b>out</b> as they were commanded, against the enemies.

5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> at night, when {{they are more likely to}} step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} two seasons once again saw Humphreys as an ever-present in the Hartlepool team under new manager Neale Cooper. In the 2003–04 season, Hartlepool once again made the play-offs, only to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> after conceding two last minute goals to Bristol City, a memory which Humphreys described as more painful than Cheltenham. Due to the injuries of Michael Barron, Humphreys began regularly captaining the team.|$|E
5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important.

You just have to do your thing and then let it <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E

Grace Remmer <b>went</b> <b>out</b> on melocoton, then Chetan Reddy and Syamantak Payra on kaburi and cipollino, respectively.

Some of the men cultivated back gardens; others took vacant lots; some <b>went</b> <b>out</b> into the suburbs; and others, like myself, <b>went</b> right <b>out</b> into the country.|$|R
5|$|When {{the album}} {{virtually}} failed to chart, {{the band was}} ready to split but had to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on tour to pay off its debts.

The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre.|$|E
5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night <b>go</b> <b>out</b> from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E
