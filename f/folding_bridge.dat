40|$|MULTI-UTILITY VEHICLE is {{a vehicle}} which carries a <b>folding</b> <b>bridge</b> and {{multiple}} sensors. This vehicle is mainly used in war-field, {{it helps the}} soldiers to cross The un-even areas {{with the help of}} the bridge. It also helps other heavy vehicles to cross the disturbed path using its bridge. It is also equipped with multiple sensors like the fire detector, gas detector, light detector. This helps the soldiers to identify the different types of threats bearing poisonous gases, increase in temperature etc. from a longer distance. Those threats can be recognized by the soldiers with the help of buzzers equipped in the detector. As it is a remote vehicle which works on the wireless transmission of ZigBee, the light detector in the vehicle is used to automatically switch on the main lights when the visibility level starts decreasing due to sunlight. This project is already implemented in European countries during the First World War. It is an upcoming technology in our country. For solving the problem of the cooperation between multi-robots, a communication system based on the ZigBee network was designed. In the hardware of the robots, the ZigBee nodes are introduced. The multi-robots form a star network by the ZigBee nodes, and they keep communication with each other by the central node. The ZigBee network has many characteristics such as low cost, low power consume, strong anti-jamming ability and real-time performance etc, it adapts to the application of intelligence. Experiments showed that the communication between the robots is reliable. This scheme is a good way for robots to complete complex task and improve working efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Currently it {{has become}} {{recognized}} that to successfully manage the crisis situation {{it is necessary to}} ensure the basic transport, particularly transport infrastructure impassable. One of the many problem areas while ensuring operation in transport is critical to ensure the functionality of artificial structures, and thus become very important just bridges that we in most cases considered by the throat on the roads. Bridges must be kept sufficiently passable,and failing this, just need to take action in the form of construction of a temporary replacement bridge. The general aim of my thesis was to analyze the usefulness of temporary bridge construction kits in crisis situations. The theoretical part describes issues related legislation with crisis management, basic concepts related to crisis management, bridge set MS, heavy bridge set TMS {{and the use of the}} Czech Army in crisis situations. Crisis management was essential after the floods in 1997 and 2002 given special attention. It was gradually ascertained that five years after the floods in Moravia in 1997, the Army increasingly lack a global perspective on the overall topic of crisis management. The focus is on bridge set MS. This is a releasable steel bridge construction, which was initially designed for the military sector to the possibility of fast implementation of temporary bypass obstacles. Another topic of interest is becoming difficult bridge kit. Heavy bridge system is normalized steel <b>folding</b> <b>bridge</b> for only one lane of the lower deck, which is designed to build bridges with one or more fields of bridges and overpasses for the construction of the railway. The use of the Czech Army is further defined as a task of the integrated rescue system in the area of internal security, where the individual components of the Integrated Rescue System and other bodies involved in internal security and civil protection must be able to respond professionally and in cooperation with other stakeholders to intervene effectively in an emergency or crisis caused by terrorist attacks, natural and environmental disasters, industrial accidents, and other dangers that threaten the lives, health, property, the environment, internal security and public order in the Czech Republic. The Czech army is used for temporary organized deployment of military units and military installations with the necessary military equipment and under the control of the appropriate commander. Military assistance becomes necessary when the designated administrative authorities, local authorities or a fire protection can no longer ensure the rescue work on their own. The use of the army for rescue operations can be done at the request of regional governors, mayors and mayors of municipalities or the Ministry of the Interior through the Operational and Information Centre Fire and Rescue through the permanent operations center of the Army of the Czech Republic. In the practical part I am focused on gathering the available general and internal information,reports and documentation on the use of temporary bridge kits in crisis situations and analysis of documents,regulations and methodologies relating to the construction of temporary bridge kits in crisis situations.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with simulation output analysis. In particular, we are inter- ested in estimating the variance parameter of a steady-state output process. The estimation of the variance parameter has immediate applications in problems involving (i) the precision of the sample mean as a point estimator for the steady-state mean and # 956;X, and (ii) confidence intervals for and # 956;X. The thesis focuses on new variance estimators arising from Schrubens method of standardized time series (STS). The main idea behind STS is to let such series converge to Brownian bridge processes; then their properties are used to derive estimators for the variance parameter. Following an idea from Shorack and Wellner, we study different levels of <b>folded</b> Brownian <b>bridges.</b> A <b>folded</b> Brownian <b>bridge</b> is obtained from the standard Brownian <b>bridge</b> process by <b>folding</b> it down the middle and then stretching {{it so that it}} spans the interval [0, 1]. We formulate the folded STS, and deduce a simplified expression for it. Similarly, we define the weighted area under the <b>folded</b> Brownian <b>bridge,</b> and we obtain its asymptotic properties and distribution. We study the square of the weighted area under the folded STS (known as the folded area estimator) and the weighted area under the square of the folded STS (known as the folded Cram??von Mises, or CvM, estimator) as estimators of the variance parameter of a stationary time series. In order to obtain results on the bias of the estimators, we provide a complete finite-sample analysis based on the mean-square error of the given estimators. Weights yielding first-order unbiased estimators are found in the area and CvM cases. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to test the efficacy of the new estimators on a test bed of stationary stochastic processes, including the first-order moving average and autoregressive processes and the waiting time process in a single-server Markovian queuing system.

40|$|The {{potential}} of using sigmoidal tension gashes as strain markers for assessing strain localisation in shear zones is discussed. The appropriate analytical methods {{for this purpose}} depend on the assumed mechanism of tension gash formation. Two such models are considered. The first {{is one in which}} the curvature of the gash is produced by passive rotation of different segments of the gash in response shear strain gradients across the shear zone. The other model is one in which the curvature of the gashes is governed by the folding of the competent rock bridges between adjacent gashes. In the latter case, the tension gashes progressively grow within spaces created by the buckling bridges and therefore lead to a bulk dilatation of the shear zone. However, for the <b>folded</b> <b>bridge</b> mechanism to continue to operate beyond shear strains greater than unity requires a significant volume loss which in turn may signal the increase of the shear strength of the zone. The geometrical characteristics of gash arrays resulting from these two mechanisms are described and criteria given for the recognition of the two types of gash arrays. A new graphical method is proposed for the analysis of deformation in shear zones containing folded-bridge tension gashes. Tension gash arrays from Marloes, West Wales are used as examples of the procedures for shear zone analysis...|$|R
