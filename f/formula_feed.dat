50|$|When used in feed for {{livestock}} or horses, middlings {{can be a}} {{good source}} of protein, fiber, and phosphorus, along with various other nutrients. However, flour milling products arising from a fairly homogeneous parent grain can vary greatly depending upon the objectives of the milling process. Thus, the degree of nutrient variation in wheat midds can be a major consideration in determining whether its inclusion in a ration or <b>formula</b> <b>feed</b> is beneficial. It has 96 percent of the energy value of barley and 91 percent of the energy value of corn. It is also used frequently as an inexpensive filler for pet food for animals such as dogs and cats, who do not digest wheat products as readily.|$|E
50|$|The company {{philosophy}} {{places a}} greater emphasis on the quality of production than the feedlot system. In feedlot cattle operations, cattle are typically subjected to an aggressive growth hormones implant strategy in order to induce rapid growth of lean muscle. Cattle in feedlots are fed a <b>formula</b> <b>feed</b> that consists of 70% to 90% grain and are also injected with rounds of parasite treatments and fed low grade antibiotics to induce growth and negate diseases that spread in feedlots. Tallgrass’ cattle, on the other hand, are allowed to roam in open pastures without the space restrictions that feedlots impose on their cattle. Additionally, they are not implanted with any synthetic growth hormones, or fed animal by-products or antibiotics. Tallgrass has a policy of not using antibiotics in any of its cattle herds. In 2001, the American Medical Association stated that it opposed the regular use of antibiotics in all levels of livestock agriculture because of scientifically verified risk assessments.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of mothers in Ireland provide formula milk to their infants {{during the initial}} weeks postpartum; however, data are lacking on their formula feeding practices and support needs. This prospective Dublin-based observational study, which included 450 eligible mother-term infant pairs recruited and followed up to 6 months postpartum, aimed to advance our understanding of maternal formula feeding practices, their reasons for deciding to <b>formula</b> <b>feed,</b> sources of feeding information and perceived support needs; insights into infant formula milk consumption patterns in relation to current feeding guidelines are also provided. In summary, the vast {{majority of}} infants at 6 weeks were provided with formula milk (n = 368; 81. 8 %). Positive maternal perceptions of formula feeding were among the most frequently reported reasons underlying mothers’ decision to <b>formula</b> <b>feed</b> (e. g. convenience, 17. 3 %). Potential public health concerns over the large formula milk volumes consumed by infants (mean 205 ml/kilogram/day) relative to infant feeding guidelines (150 ml/kilogram/day) were raised from this study. Some mothers continue to add solid foods to infant bottle feeds at 6 weeks (3. 8 %) and 6 months (6 %), a non-recommended feeding practice posing a choking risk for infants. Crucially, this study highlights the need to provide greater support and information to mothers who decide to <b>formula</b> <b>feed</b> postpartum including practical information on sterilisation and formula reconstitution. While breastfeeding promotion and research continues to be a public health priority in Ireland, addressing the support and information needs of mothers who <b>formula</b> <b>feed,</b> an underrepresented and understudied population in the literature, also needs to be considered to ensure optimal health and safety for their infants...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: While the {{initiation}} of breastfeeding is universal in Nepal, little has been reported on <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. This study aimed to report the prevalence of, and factors associated with, the use of infant <b>formula</b> as supplementary <b>feeds</b> in the Western region of Nepal. METHODS: A community-based cohort {{study was conducted to}} collect infant feeding information among 735 postpartum mothers using structured questionnaires. Complete <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> data were collected from 711 women in the first, fourth and sixth month postpartum. Factors independently associated with <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> were investigated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: All mothers were breastfeeding their infants at the time of recruitment. The prevalence of <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> was 7. 5  % in the first month and 17  % in the sixth month. About a quarter of mothers (23. 8  %) reported providing infant formula at least once during {{the first six months of}} life. Infant formula was used commonly as top-up food. Stepwise logistic regression showed that infants born to families residing in urban areas (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) : 2. 14; 95  % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 37 to 3. 33), mothers with higher education (aOR: 2. 08; 95  % CI: 1. 14 to 3. 80), and infants born by caesarean section (aOR: 1. 96; 95  % CI: 1. 21 to 3. 18) were at greater risk of <b>formula</b> <b>feeding.</b> CONCLUSION: The current findings indicate that health workers should support mothers to initiate and continue exclusive breastfeeding particularly after caesarean deliveries. Furthermore, urban health programs in Nepal should incorporate breastfeeding programs which discourage the unnecessary use of <b>formula</b> <b>feeding.</b> The marketing of formula milk should be monitored more vigilantly especially in the aftermath of the April 2015 earthquakes or other natural disasters...|$|R

The average body weight (BW) of the ducks fed a PRF diet was 1, 673 g at 12 weeks of age, being significantly lower than that of control (2, 003 g, P< 0. 05). As for the carcass characteristics, no significant difference was observed in the dressing percentage between the treatments, though the dressed carcass weight of the PRF group was significantly lower than that of control (P< 0. 05). The sensory test for breast meats was not significantly different between treatments. The egg production rate (hen day's average) of the PRF group was 27. 0 %, being significantly lower than that of control (53. 4 %, P< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Parental {{decision-making}} around extended <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> (12 months+) has {{not been}} explored previously. This study tested the hypotheses that extended formula milk use (i) is associated with poorer appetite and (ii) supplements lower food intake. METHODS: Appetite was assessed with the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in 3854 twin children aged 16 months. Diet was assessed from 3 -day diaries in 2714 children at 21 months. Parents reported their children's weight at 24 months. Associations between <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> and (1) appetite, (2) energy intake and (3) weight were examined. 35 mothers were interviewed when the children were 7 years old to explore retrospectively their reasons for extended <b>formula</b> <b>feeding.</b> RESULTS: <b>Formula</b> consumers (13 % of the sample) scored significantly differently than non-formula consumers on {{five of the six}} CEBQ subscales, indicating lower appetite avidity: 'food responsiveness' (2. 02 vs 2. 22, respectively),'enjoyment of food' (3. 99 vs 4. 20), 'satiety responsiveness' (2. 89 vs 2. 65), 'slowness in eating' (2. 63 vs 2. 46) and 'food fussiness' (2. 34 vs 2. 14). Formula consumers had a significantly lower percentage of daily energy intake from food (70 % vs 74 %); however, total daily energy intake did not differ significantly from non-consumers (4315 vs 4373 kJ). At interview, mothers reported supplementing their child's diet with formula because of 'picky eating' and concerns about inadequate food intake.

In-depth interviews were conducted to examine expectant mothers’ understandings of toddler milk advertisements. Content analysis was used to compare the frequency with which advertisements for various formula products and brands appeared in parenting magazines from countries with differing regulations about the marketing of formula milk products. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the effect of exposure to toddler milk advertising on attitudes and beliefs about breastfeeding and <b>formula</b> <b>feeding.</b> A series of discussion fora were used investigate the influence of advertising on the infant feeding attitudes and beliefs of parents and those who influence them. RESULTS Mothers expecting a first baby perceived toddler milk advertisements to be advertising infant formula and found their claims that formula brands can confer health benefits similar to those mothers associate with breastfeeding to be believable. Toddler milk advertisements occurred with greater frequency in Australian parenting magazines than they did in those from the UK, USA or Canada.

Results: The body weight and lengths of infants in the all three groups showed no statistical difference for the first 4 months according to the feeding types (p> 0. 05). However, growth of the infants with <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> and mixed feeding began to exceed the breast feed group gradually from the 4 months on. The differences of weight are statistically significant from 6 - 12 month and 4 - 12 month respectively, compared with breast feeding group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The infants with mixed or <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> are exposed a higher risk of overweight between 6 - 12 months of the first year. Breast-feeding may have a potential benefit in preventing infant obesity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the effect of adding specific prebiotics to standard <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> on the number of fever episodes in the first year of life. In the present randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in seven centres in five West European countries, 830 healthy term infants, without a first-degree family history of allergic disease, of mothers who indicated to give only <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> were randomised either to receive a standard non-hydrolysed cows' milk-based formula to which a mixture of specific oligosaccharides was added (prebiotics group (PG)), or to receive a similar formula without oligosaccharides (control group (CG)). A separate reference group consisted of 300 breast-fed infants. The primary outcome was the number of fever episodes prospectively documented by the parents. There was no difference in the number of fever episodes between the PG (median value 1 · 19; 25 th- 75 th percentile 0 · 09 - 2 · 34) and CG (1 · 16; 25 th- 75 th percentile 0 · 06 - 2 · 38). The median number of fever episodes in the separate breast-feeding reference group was 1 · 24 (25 th- 75 th percentile 0 · 51 - 3 · 45). There was no effect of adding specific prebiotics to standard <b>formula</b> <b>feeding</b> in reducing the number of fever episodes in the present study...|$|R
40|$|Does {{breastfeeding}} lead {{to higher}} levels of intelligence compared with <b>formula</b> <b>feeding?</b> EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER: There may be a positive association between longer duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding and higher cognitive function scores, but any such effect is small (SOR: B, based on a systematic review of conflicting studies and subsequent prospective cohort studies) ...|$|R
