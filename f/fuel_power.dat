25|$|In {{a fossil}} <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> plant the {{chemical}} energy stored in fossil fuels such as coal, fuel oil, natural gas or oil shale and oxygen {{of the air}} is converted successively into thermal energy, mechanical energy and, finally, electrical energy. Each fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> plant is a complex, custom-designed system. Construction costs, , run to US$1,300 per kilowatt, or $650 million for a 500 M We unit. Multiple generating units may be built at a single site for more efficient use of land, natural resources and labor. Most thermal power stations in the world use fossil fuel, outnumbering nuclear, geothermal, biomass, or solar thermal plants.|$|E
25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce landfilling. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, torrefaction of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> plant will be using.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the threats that wind farms pose to birds before surveying the recent literature on avian mortality and summarizing common methodological problems with such studies. Based on operating {{performance in the}} United States and Europe, the paper then offers a preliminary calculation {{of the number of}} birds killed per kilowatt-hour kWh generated for wind electricity, fossil <b>fuel,</b> and nuclear <b>power</b> systems. The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0. 3 and 0. 4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil <b>fueled</b> <b>power</b> stations are responsible for about 5. 2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20, 000 birds in the United States in 2009 but nuclear plants killed about 330, 000 and fossil <b>fueled</b> <b>power</b> plants more than 14 million. The paper concludes that further study is needed, but also that fossil <b>fueled</b> <b>power</b> stations appear to pose a much greater threat to birds and avian wildlife than wind farms and nuclear power plants...|$|R

25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield synthetic crude oil when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> stations and other uses.|$|E

Captured CO2 from the waste exhaust flue gases will be injected into circulating waste water to grow oil-rich algae where sunlight and nutrients will produce heavy oil-laden slurry that can make high grade oil for energy, or stock feed.

25|$|Compared to the {{environmental}} impact of traditional energy sources, {{the environmental}} impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.|$|E
25|$|Beyond {{these new}} plants, {{there are a}} number of options that might be used to provide the new {{generating}} capacity, while minimising carbon emissions and producing less residues and contamination. Fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>power</b> plants might provide a solution if there was a satisfactory and economical way of reducing their carbon emissions. Carbon capture might provide a way of doing this; however the technology is relatively untried and costs are relatively high. As yet (2006) there are no power plants in operation with a full carbon capture and storage system.|$|E
