5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea <b>garfish</b> (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea <b>garfish</b> (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
25|$|The <b>garfish</b> is a long, slender fish, {{looking like}} a spear, which feeds on {{seagrass}} fragments, shrimps and crab larvae. In turn it is preyed on by larger fish and, since it is often near the surface, cormorants and gannets.|$|E
50|$|T. exiguus is able {{to thrive}} in a variety hosts. It has been found as an {{intestinal}} parasite in anchovies, sand-smelts, shads, <b>garfishes,</b> eels, sticklebacks, pipe-fishes, grass gobies, some other gobies, blennies, and wrasses.|$|R
6000|$|The name [...] "bill-fish," [...] usually {{applied to}} our Tetrapturus albidus, a fish of the {{swordfish}} family, often taken on our coast, must be pronounced objectionable, {{since it is}} in many districts used for various species of Belonidæ, the <b>garfishes</b> or green-bones (Belone truncata and others), which {{are members of the}} same faunas. Spear-fish is a much better name.|$|R
50|$|Located in {{the urban}} area of the municipality, is two {{kilometers}} long and has several bars and restaurants. Every year, it holds a fishing festival of <b>garfishes.</b> Its major attraction is the Lady Lia, a well known singer of Ciranda, a folklore musical style. It has a small strip of land when at high tide. There lies the cross of Our Lady of Pilar.|$|R
25|$|Examples of {{shallow water}} pelagic fish, found in both {{tropical}} and temperate waters around the world, are grey mullet, sprats and <b>garfish.</b> As pelagic fish, all these fish {{spend most of}} their time living in the water column away the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|In 1375, Rana Wikrama was {{succeeded by}} his son Seri Maharaja. According to Malay Annals, the reign of Seri Maharaja was marked with the event of Todak (<b>garfish)</b> ravaging the coast of Singapura. A young boy, Hang Nadim, thought of an ingenious {{solution}} {{to fend off the}} todak. The king was initially grateful, but felt increasingly threatened by the boy's intelligence, and ordered to have the boy executed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 203 species of fish inhabit the Oyster Harbour, Princess Royal Harbour and King George Sound, with Australian pilchards Sardinops sagax neopilchardus making up 97% of the total fish catch. Other species that are commonly found include Australian herring, leatherjackets, cobbler, King George whiting, tailor, Australian anchovy, <b>garfish,</b> sand trevally, tarwhine, flathead, tuna, snapper, Australian salmon, yellowtail scad, sea mullet, striped trumpeter, long-toothed flounder, dusky morwong and long-finned goby.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{existence}} of a fossil record, full classification and phylogeny of the sturgeon species has been difficult to determine, in part due to the high individual and ontogenic variation, including geographical clines in certain features, such as rostrum shape, number of scutes and body length. A further confounding factor is the peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids, even between species assigned to different genera. While ray-finned fishes have a long evolutionary history culminating in our most familiar fishes, past adaptive radiations have left only a few survivors, like sturgeons and <b>garfish.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with its}} {{presence}} in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin {{is present in the}} blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs. With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green colour fades out soon after birth. In the <b>garfish</b> (Belone belone) and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin.|$|E
25|$|Tourism {{is now one}} of {{the largest}} {{components}} of the town's economy, with tourists typically drawn by the areas fishing, water sport and seaside atmosphere. A boat ramp is located in the town, with whiting, snapper, tommy ruff, <b>garfish,</b> salmon and may other popular species caught in the bay, with most of these also available off the town jetty and beach. For boat anglers, the 'Redbanks' region has been known to produce large Mulloway and Snapper, as well as offering scenery in the form of the imposing cliffs. The local aquaculture industry also promotes tourism, with tours through facilities where finfish are raised.|$|E
25|$|These {{mangroves}} {{are important}} nursery grounds {{for nearly all}} major angling fish including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), flat-tail sea-mullet (Liza argentea), luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves into the thick rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea <b>garfish</b> (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots around just an inch from the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|E
500|$|Marine {{halfbeaks}} {{are typically}} pelagic schooling forage fish. The southern sea <b>garfish</b> Hyporhamphus melanochir for example {{is found in}} sheltered bays, coastal seas, estuaries around southern Australia in waters down {{to a depth of}} [...] These fish school near the surface at night but swim closer to the sea floor during the day, particularly among beds of seagrasses. Genetic analysis of the different sub-populations of the eastern sea <b>garfish</b> Hyporhamphus melanochir in South Australian coastal waters reveals that there is a small but consistent migration of individuals among theme, sufficient to keep them genetically homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the ecology of {{juvenile}} marine halfbeaks, though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species.

[...] The main piece is the section above the saint's knees and it includes the Christ child. [...] The smaller piece is the base, consisting of the saint's lower legs and the river. [...] The missing piece would have fitted into a hollow on the saint's right side. [...] The right arm of the saint and the Christ child's right arm are missing. [...] It is likely that the Christ child's arm would have been raised in benediction, and the saint's arm would have carried a staff. [...] The Christ child's head is not original having been replaced in the 17thcentury. [...] There is a break running from the saint's forehead to below Christ's knee. [...] The details of the carving remain fine, with little weathering. [...] The depictions of the fish are sufficiently realistic for the species of all but one to be identified; the species identified are <b>garfish,</b> pike, mullet, carp or bream, and plaice or flounder. [...] Fragments of paint remain on the surface showing that the statue was originally brightly coloured, with a vermilion cloak, naturally coloured skin, and a grey beard. [...] Traces of wax are also present, some of them overlaid by particles of blue-green paint.|$|E
6000|$|IN the sea, {{once upon}} a time, O my Best Beloved, there was a Whale, and he ate fishes. He ate the starfish and the <b>garfish,</b> and the crab and the dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the mackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till at last {{there was only one}} small fish left in all the sea, and he was a small 'Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale's right ear, so as to be out of harm's way.
