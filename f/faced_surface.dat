Three self acting bearing configurations, designed to supply load support at the interface of the stationary carbon seal and rotating seal race, were tested. Two configurations, the shrouded taper and shrouded flat step, were incorporated {{on the face of}} the stationary carbon seal element. The third configuration, inward pumping spiral grooves, was incorporated on the hard <b>faced</b> <b>surface</b> of the rotating seal race. Test results demonstrated seal leakage air flow rates from 75 to 95 % lower that can be achieved with best state-of-the-art labyrinth designs and led to identification of the need for a more geometrically stable seal design configuration which is presently being manufactured for subsequent test evaluation...|$|E
40|$|A {{section of}} the {{retrieved}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) solar array drive arm (SADA) multilayer insulation (MLI), which experienced 8. 25 years of space exposure, was analyzed for environmental durability of {{the top layer of}} silver-Teflon (DuPont) fluorinated ethylene propylene (Ag-FEP). Because the SADA MLI had solar and anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> and was exposed to the space environment for a long duration, it provided a unique opportunity to study solar effects on the environmental degradation of Ag-FEP, a commonly used spacecraft thermal control material. Data obtained included tensile properties, solar absorptance, surface morphology and chemistry. The solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> was found to be extremely embrittled and contained numerous through-thickness cracks. Tensile testing indicated that the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> lost 60 % of its mechanical strength and 90 % of its elasticity while the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> had ductility similar to pristine FEP. The solar absorptance of both the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 155 plus or minus 0. 032) and the anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> (0. 208 plus or minus 0. 012) were found to be greater than pristine Ag-FEP (0. 074). Solar facing and anti-solar <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> were microscopically textured, and locations of isolated contamination were present on the anti-solar surface resulting in increased localized texturing. Yet, the overall texture was significantly more pronounced on the solar <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> indicating a synergistic effect of combined solar exposure and increased heating with atomic oxygen erosion. The results indicate a very strong dependence of degradation, particularly embrittlement, upon solar exposure with orbital thermal cycling having a significant effect...|$|R

40|$|Rhizocarpon geographicum is a crustose lichen found {{frequently}} on rock surfaces of southern aspect and less {{frequently on}} rock surfaces of northern aspect in Gwynedd, North Wales. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} the radial growth of R. geographicum thalli predicts aspect distribution. Thalli of all sizes, however, exhibited significantly greater radial growth over 18 months on northwest compared with southeast <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The hypothesis that a more intense competitive environment on northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> may explain the aspect distribution of R. geographicum was then tested. The size frequency distributions of thalli revealed a higher proportion of thalli in the smallest size class and a more restricted thallus size range on the northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, thallus mortality appeared to be greater on northwest <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Significantly more associated lichen species were present on rock surfaces of northern aspect at sites where R. geographicum was present. The mean frequency of the associated lichen species, however, was significantly lower on surfaces of northern aspect where R. geographicum was present. In addition, two common foliose species at these sites were demonstrated experimentally to overgrow thalli of R. geographicum. It is concluded that the growth of R. geographicum over the study period did not predict aspect distribution and that differences in the competitive environments on northwest and southeast surfaces may be an important factor determining aspect distribution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Parmelia conspersa (Ehrh. Ex Ach.) Ach. is a foliose lichen {{found more}} {{frequently}} on south facing compared with north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces</b> in South Gwynedd, Wales, UK. The radial growth of thalli of P. conspersa from a north and a south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> {{was measured in}} situ at intervals of two months for 1 yr during 1990 / 1991. Mean annual radial growth rates were greater on the south compared with the north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface.</b> In addition, the pattern of radial growth varied during the year with maximum growth recorded in the Feb/Mar. period especially on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface.</b> The levels of ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were measured in individual lobes of P. conspersa collected from the same rock surfaces on 4 days (2 Jun; 7 July and 30 Nov. 1990 and 29 Mar. 1991) during 1990 / 1991. The total of the three carbohydrates varied between days; the levels of arbitol and ribitol being significantly lower in the 7 July sample on both north and south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces.</b> In addition, the levels ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were higher on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> especially in the summer samples. The ratio of arabitol plus mannitol to ribitol and the mannitol/arabitol ratio varied more between days sampled than {{between north and south}} <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces.</b> The level of ribitol in individual thalli was positively correlated with arabitol on the north facing and with mannitol on the south facing slope. These results suggest that differences in the radial growth of P. conspersa thalli with aspect are more likely to reflect higher rates of photosynthesis on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> rather than large difference in the way carbohydrates were partitioned on the different surfaces. Lower radial growth rates may place P. conspersa at a competitive disadvantage on north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

Taking a 3 D triangular facial mesh as input, the approach first automatically extracts the bilateral symmetry {{plane of the}} <b>face</b> <b>surface.</b> The intersection between the symmetry plane and the facial surface, namely the Symmetry Profile, is then computed. By using both the mean curvature plot of the facial surface and the curvature plot of the symmetry profile curve, three essential points of the nose on the symmetry profile are automatically extracted. The three essential points uniquely determine a Face Intrinsic Coordinate System (FICS). Different faces are aligned based on the FICS. The Symmetry Profile, together with two transverse profiles compose a compact representation, called the SFC representation, of a 3 D <b>face</b> <b>surface.</b> The <b>face</b> authentication and recognition steps are finally performed by comparing the SFC representations of the faces.

40|$|Daylight {{utilization}} is a {{key factor}} in achieving visual and thermal comfort, and energy savings in integrated building design. However, lack of measured data related to this topic has become a major challenge with the increasing need for integrating lighting concepts and simulations {{in the early stages of}} design procedures. The current paper deals with the values of daylight illuminance on horizontal and south facing vertical surfaces; the data are estimated using IESNA model and measured values of the horizontal and vertical illuminance, and a regression model with an acceptable linear correlation is obtained. The resultant illuminance frequency curves are useful for estimating daylight availability on south <b>facing</b> <b>surfaces</b> in Tehran. In addition, the relationship between indirect vertical illuminance and the corresponding global horizontal illuminance is analyzed. A simple parametric equation is proposed in order to predict the vertical illumination on a shaded south <b>facing</b> <b>surface.</b> The equation correlates the ratio between the vertical and horizontal illuminance to the solar altitude and is used with another relationship for prediction of the vertical illuminance. Both equations show good agreement, which allows for calculation of indirect vertical illuminance on a south <b>facing</b> <b>surface</b> at any time throughout the year...|$|R

The dynamics of a Sn vapour cloud are investigated by exposing liquid Sn targets to H and He plasmas at heat fluxes greater than 5 [*]MW[*]m− 2.

A fully remote metrology system is necessary, particularly since major remote operations such as shield blanket exchange and divertor cassette replacement are planned. The metrology system must be compatible with the ITER in-vessel environment of high gamma radiation ({approximately} 10 {sup 6 } R/hr), super-clean ultra-high-vacuum ({approximately} 10 {sup {minus} 8 } Torr), and elevated temperature ({approximately} 200 C).

Lobes were collected from a north and a south <b>facing</b> slate rock <b>surface</b> in South Gwynedd, Wales, U. K. on 4 days during 1990 - 1991. On each day sampled, the most significant variation in soluble carbohydrate levels was between the individual lobes of a thallus. In addition, carbohydrate levels were significantly greater on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface</b> on 2 of the 4 days sampled. Factorial analyses of variance suggested that the levels of individual carbohydrates varied significantly between days but not {{between north and south}} <b>facing</b> rock <b>surfaces.</b> Mannitol levels varied less between days than arabitol levels. Levels of ribitol, arabitol and mannitol were positively correlated in individual lobes. A stepwise multiple regression suggested that on the north <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface,</b> arabitol and mannitol levels could be explained by variations in the level of ribitol. By contrast, on the south <b>facing</b> rock <b>surface,</b> the levels of fungal carbohydrates were less dependent on the level of ribitol and there was evidence of a relationship between arabitol and mannitol.
