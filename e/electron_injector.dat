50|$|The two {{injector}} {{regions are}} each designed to efficiently transfer its namesake carriers (electrons or holes) from the semimetallic interface to the active region. They must also double as rectifying barriers for the opposite type of carrier {{in order to}} prevent inter-stage leakage currents. The total injector (<b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> plus hole injector) should also be sufficiently thick overall to prevent the electric fields forming under bias from becoming great enough to induce dielectric breakdown of the material. The <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> is usually made longer because of the relatively fast inter-well scattering rate of electrons compared to that of holes. This ensures a smaller series resistance contribution from the total injector transport. The hole injector is composed of GaSb/AlSb quantum wells. It is made just thick enough (typically with just one or two wells) to ensure effective suppression of electron tunneling from the active region to the <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> of the next stage. The <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> typically consists of a longer series of InAs/AlSb quantum wells. To maximize the InAs/AlSb superlattice miniband width, the InAs layer thicknesses are varied across the injector so that their ground state energies nearly align when the device is biased. The quantum well energy gaps in the injector must be large enough to preclude reabsorption of the photons generated by the active quantum wells.|$|E

40|$|We {{report that}} {{transverse}} emittance {{can be reduced}} by the space charge effects in <b>electron</b> <b>injectors.</b> The reduction of emittance in an ideal DC-accelerated continuous beam is numerically calculated and the mechanisms of the reduction are analytically discussed. Beam edge and image charge effects at a cathode produce a particular nonlinearity in r–r′ phase space, which is discussed in the paper, and they contribute to reducing the emittance immediately after the cathode. We also show examples of reduced emittance for practical <b>electron</b> <b>injectors</b> such as that in the SCSS thermionic gun with a continuous beam, {{and those in the}} SPring- 8 rf photoinjector and the BNL-type rf photoinjector with pulsed beams. For pulsed beams, the focusing effects caused by an rf cavity also contribute to reducing the emittance. These reductions only appear when the beam charge is low...|$|R

5000|$|Each cascade stage {{effectively}} acts as {{an individual}} photon generator. A single stage is composed of an <b>electron</b> <b>injector,</b> a hole injector, and an active gain region consisting of one hole QW {{and one or two}} electron QWs. [...] When the device is biased, excess electrons and holes are generated and flow into the active region, where they recombine and emit light. In order to minimize optical losses at the semimetallic interface forming the boundary between the electron and hole injectors, a layer of AlSb is placed between the InAs and GaSb layers to prevent interband reabsorption of the generated photons.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} {{feature that}} differentiates the ICL {{from all other}} laser diodes is its provision for electrically-pumped operation without a p-n junction. This is possible because the injectors function as rectifying barriers that keep the current flowing in a single direction. Nevertheless, it is highly advantageous to dope certain layers in each cascade stage {{as a means of}} controlling the active electron and hole densities, via a design technique called “carrier rebalancing.” [...] While the most favorable combination of electron and hole populations depends on the relative strengths of various free carrier absorption and Auger recombination processes, the studies done thus far indicate that the ICL performance is optimal when at threshold the two concentrations are roughly equal. Since the hole population tends to substantially exceed the electron population in undoped or moderately-doped ICLs, carrier rebalancing is achieved by heavily n-doping the <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> (typically, with Si) so as to add electrons to the active QWs.|$|E

40|$|Ballistic and quasiballistic {{electron}} transport {{across the}} active InGaN layer are {{shown to be}} responsible for electron overflow and electroluminescence efficiency droop at high current levels in InGaN light emitting diodes both experimentally and by first-order calculations. An InGaN staircase <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> with step-like increased In composition, an “electron cooler,” is proposed for an enhanced thermalization of the injected hot electrons to reduce the overflow and mitigate the efficiency droop. The experimental data show that the staircase <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> results in essentially the same electroluminescence performance for the diodes with and without an electron blocking layer, confirming substantial electron thermalization. On the other hand, if no InGaN staircase <b>electron</b> <b>injector</b> is employed, the diodes without the electron blocking layer have shown significantly lower (three to five times) electroluminescence intensity than the diodes with the blocking layer.

40|$|Weak, rotated {{magnetic}} {{and radio}} frequency quadrupole fields in <b>electron</b> guns and <b>injectors</b> can couple the beam’s horizontal with vertical motion, introduce correlations between otherwise orthogonal transverse momenta, {{and reduce the}} beam brightness. This paper discusses two important sources of coupled transverse dynamics common to most <b>electron</b> <b>injectors.</b> The first is quadrupole focusing followed by beam rotation in a solenoid, and the second coupling comes from a skewed high-power rf coupler or cavity port which has a rotated rf quadrupole field.

40|$|A new {{two-dimensional}} beam-tracking simulation {{code for}} <b>electron</b> <b>injectors</b> using a bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields was developed. The calculated space charge fields are produced {{not by a}} point charge but by a hollow cylinder that has a volume. Each tracked electron is a point charge. This bulk-to-point calculation technique for space charge fields is based on that used in the multiple beam envelope equations, which were developed by the author. The multiple beam envelope equations are a set of differential equations for investigating the beam dynamics of <b>electron</b> <b>injectors</b> {{and can be used}} to calculate bunched beam dynamics with high accuracy. However, there is one limitation. The bunched beam is assumed to be an ensemble of several segmentation pieces in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. In this bunch model, each longitudinal segmentation slice in a bunch must not warp; consequently, the accuracy of the calculated emittance is reduced {{in the case of a}} highly charged beam for calculations of a typical rf gun injector system. This limitation is related to the calculation model of longitudinal space charge fields. In the newly developed beam-tracking simulation code, the space charge field calculation scheme is upgraded and the limitation has been overcome. Therefore, the applicable range is extended while maintaining the high accuracy of emittance calculations. Simultaneously, the calculation time is markedly shortened because the emittance dependence on the segmentation number is extremely weak. In this paper, several examples of beam dynamics that cannot be calculated accurately using the multiple beam envelope equations are demonstrated using the new beam-tracking simulation code. The accuracy of the calculated emittance is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Small, stray {{magnetic}} and RF {{fields in}} <b>electron</b> guns and <b>injectors</b> can perturb an electron beam and introduce {{correlations between the}} otherwise orthogonal transverse trajectories. These correlations couple the x and y dynamics which increases the transverse emittance. If the correlation becomes "diluted" or randomized in the beam transport then as the correlation disappears the 4 D emittance increases. This paper discusses two important correlations common to most <b>electron</b> <b>injectors.</b> The first results from the coupling of a weak quadrupole field with beam rotation in a solenoid, and the second x-y coupling is generated by an asymmetric on-axis RF field due to a high-power RF coupler or cavity port. This paper shows that a small quadrupole field combined with solenoidal focusing can result in significant emittance growth due to coupled transverse dynamics. It also shows how adding a skewed quadrupole field can exactly cancel this correlation and its emittance.
