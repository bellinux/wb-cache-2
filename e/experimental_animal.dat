He developed it in the <b>experimental</b> <b>animal</b> laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis is a {{physiological}} process involving {{the growth of}} new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Under normal physiological conditions angiogenesis is tightly regulated and is controlled by a balance of angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors. Tumor growth is dependent upon angiogenesis and during tumor development a sustained production of angiogenic stimulatory factors is required along with {{a reduction in the}} quantity of angiogenic inhibitory factors tumor cells produce. The cleaved and latent form of antithrombin potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in animal models. The prelatent form of antithrombin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in-vitro but to date has not been tested in <b>experimental</b> <b>animal</b> models.|$|E
25|$|D. melanogaster is {{a popular}} <b>experimental</b> <b>animal</b> because it is easily cultured en masse out of the wild, has a short {{generation}} time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable. In 1906, Thomas Hunt Morgan began his work on D. melanogaster and reported his first finding of a 'white' (eyed) mutant in 1910 to the academic community. He was {{in search of a}} model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on Drosophila earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other Drosophila species are widely used in studies of genetics, embryogenesis, and other areas.|$|E

2500|$|In cancer {{research}} experiments, tumor cells are sometimes injected into an <b>experimental</b> <b>animal</b> {{to establish a}} tumor. Disease progression is then followed in time and novel drugs can be tested for their efficacy. Tumor formation requires thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} cells to be introduced. Classically, this was explained by poor methodology (i.e., the tumor cells lose their [...] during transfer) or the critical importance of the microenvironment, the particular biochemical surroundings of the injected cells. Supporters of the CSC paradigm argue that {{only a small fraction of}} the injected cells, the CSCs, have the potential to generate a tumor. In human acute myeloid leukemia the frequency of these cells is less than 1 in 10,000.|$|E
