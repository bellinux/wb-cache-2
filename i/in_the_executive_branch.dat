5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} officials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>branch.</b> Congress {{passed a bill}} sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against {{a bill that would}} have mandated senatorial consent for the removal of Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments.

5|$|The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} officer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>branch</b> {{of the state}} government of New Jersey in the United States. The lieutenant governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next {{in the order of}} succession, the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>branch</b> from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's vice {{presidency}} is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition {{to prevent him from}} assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>branch,</b> the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>branch</b> of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion {{in the exercise of}} certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Branch</b> of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
