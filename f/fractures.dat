5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past <b>fractures</b> will be evident by the {{presence}} of bone remodeling. The examination of any <b>fractures</b> on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem <b>fractures</b> will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem <b>fractures</b> will not. Peri-mortem <b>fractures</b> will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

Stress <b>fractures</b> in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress <b>fractures</b> there can be obtained while running or during migration.

5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial.

But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed <b>fractures,</b> it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour.

The <b>fracture</b> toughness of A 508 - 16 MnR at different cleavage <b>fracture</b> probability are predicted {{by using the}} method. To most of pressure vessel carbon-manganese steels, cleavage <b>fracture</b> is likely to occur at the load corresponding to 62 % cleavage <b>fracture</b> probability. Hence, the <b>fracture</b> toughness corresponding to the load is the most possible <b>fracture</b> toughness of the steels.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of an induced hydraulic <b>fracture</b> and a natural <b>fracture</b> in a poroelastic medium and study their interaction. A finite element based numerical model is developed for this purpose. The model integrates a wellbore, an induced hydraulic <b>fracture,</b> a natural <b>fracture</b> and a reservoir in a fully coupled manner and simulates {{the interaction between}} induced hydraulic <b>fracture</b> and a natural <b>fracture.</b> A half reservoir model is used {{to take advantage of}} symmetry. In order to have control over the entire grid and element numbering, an innovative mesh generator was developed as part of this study. <b>Fracture</b> propagation is modeled based on KGD <b>fracture</b> mechanics. The numerical studies have shown that a natural <b>fracture</b> has a profound effect on the induced <b>fracture</b> propagation. It has been observed that in most cases the induced <b>fracture</b> crosses the natural <b>fracture</b> at high angles of approach and high differential stress. The width of the induced <b>fracture</b> decreases as it propagates. Once the induced <b>fracture</b> crosses a natural <b>fracture</b> and it propagates further into the formation <b>fracture</b> width increases. At low angles of approach and low differential stress the induced <b>fracture</b> {{is more likely to be}} arrested (at least short time) and/or breaks out from the far end side of the natural <b>fracture.</b> Results also showed that in the case of high angle of approach the hydraulic <b>fracture</b> always crosses the natural <b>fracture</b> and the differential stress has no significant effect on the propagation of hydraulic <b>fracture.</b> It has been also observed that propagation of induced <b>fracture</b> is stopped by a large (> 10 m) natural <b>fracture</b> at high angle of approach. If the injection rate, however, is increased the induced <b>fracture</b> crosses the large natural <b>fracture</b> at high angle of approach. At low angle of approach the induced <b>fracture</b> deviates and propagates along natural <b>fracture.</b> Crossing of natural <b>fracture</b> and/or arrest by the natural <b>fracture</b> is controlled by shear strength of the natural <b>fracture,</b> natural <b>fracture</b> orientation and in-situ stress state of the reservoir. From the results of this study it has been found that this model has a potential application in the design and optimization of hydraulic <b>fracture</b> treatments in naturally <b>fractured</b> reservoirs including tight gas reservoirs and enhanced geothermal systems. The model can also be used in the design of hydraulic stimulation of naturally <b>fractured</b> reservoirs based on shear dilation principle...|$|R
40|$|Low-permeability gas wells often produce {{less than}} {{predicted}} after a <b>fracture</b> treatment. One {{of the reasons}} for this is that <b>fracture</b> lengths calculated after stimulation are often less than designed lengths. While actual <b>fracture</b> lengths may be shorter due to <b>fracture</b> growth out of zone, improper proppant settling, or proppant flowback, short calculated <b>fracture</b> lengths can also result from incorrect analysis techniques. It is known that <b>fracturing</b> fluid that remains in the <b>fracture</b> and formation after a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> treatment can decrease the productivity of a gas well by reducing the relative permeability to gas in the region invaded by this fluid. However, the relationships between <b>fracture</b> fluid cleanup, effective <b>fracture</b> length, and well productivity are not fully understood. In this work I used reservoir simulation to determine the relationship between <b>fracture</b> conductivity, <b>fracture</b> fluid production, effective <b>fracture</b> length, and well productivity. I simulated water saturation and pressure profiles around a propped <b>fracture,</b> tracked gas production {{along the length of the}} propped <b>fracture,</b> and quantified the effective <b>fracture</b> length (i. e., the <b>fracture</b> length under single-phase flow conditions that gives similar performance as for multiphase flow conditions), the "cleanup" <b>fracture</b> length (i. e., the <b>fracture</b> length corresponding to 90 % cumulative gas flow rate into the <b>fracture),</b> and the "apparent" <b>fracture</b> length (i. e., the <b>fracture</b> length where the ratio of multiphase to single-phase gas entry rate profiles is unity). This study shows that the proppant pack is generally cleaned up and the cleanup lengths are close to designed lengths in relatively short times. Although gas is entering along entire <b>fracture,</b> <b>fracturing</b> fluid remains in the formation near the <b>fracture.</b> The water saturation distribution affects the gas entry rate profile, which determines the effective <b>fracture</b> length. Subtle changes in the gas rate entry profile can result in significant changes in effective <b>fracture</b> length. The results I derived from this work are consistent with prior work, namely that greater <b>fracture</b> conductivity results in more effective well cleanup and longer effective <b>fracture</b> lengths versus time. This study provides better explanation of mechanisms that affect <b>fracturing</b> fluid cleanup, effective <b>fracture</b> length, and well productivity than previous work...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg <b>fractures</b> and dislocations, spinal <b>fractures,</b> hip <b>fractures,</b> head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal <b>fractures.</b> As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
