An intelligent street light management system based on LED lamps and wireless communication technologies can be designed and installed in the cities. Though, it will have initial cost of <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> the traditional wired systems but lots of power can be saved by using this system. An intelligent street light system can detect vehicles and vary the intensity of the street light by using LED lamps as per the traffic flow. It can also help in monitoring and controlling of street light system and fault detection of the lamps through wireless technology...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Modern, {{analytical}} {{tools are}} critical to understand the impact of open architecture technology and open business models on naval warfighting processes and procedures. These tools must measure the operational value of a system from an end-user, warfighter perspective, identify areas of deficiencies in capabilities, and flag areas for potential acquisitions. One advantage of examining open architected system upgrade options from a warfighter perspective {{is that the new}} systems can be integrated with reengineered processes more easily leading to improved process performance. This perspective, using OA to upgrade existing IWS systems, ensures that upgrades will lead to improved warfighting capabilities. Traditional measurement tools used for cost analysis cannot calculate the total value of upgrading a system to support an improved warfighting capability, particularly the improved operational value resulting from reengineering of warfighting processes. The Knowledge Value Added/Real Options (KVA+RO) Valuation Framework is a tool designed to assist decision-makers in making technology acquisitions. This paper describes research using the KVA+RO framework for estimating return on investment, in an open architecture approach, to upgrading and/or replacing aging IWS AEGIS and SSDS systems. The results of the research indicated that using the open architecture (OA) model, in combination with the ''leave and layer'' approach, was approximately five times more valuable than the current proprietary approach to system replacement and was approximately twice as valuable as a complete retrofit and replace strategy. ''Leave and layer'' provided the highest return on <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> the AEGIS system with the lowest risk. The ultimate success of the OA approach is dependent on the ability of the multiple parties to system development and deployment to collaborate. Collaboration, along with the tools that facilitate collaboration, is {{critical to the success of}} any of the OA approaches. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|E

With a deal made with the Facebook data center, Fjernvarme Fyn in Odense, Denmark will be able to receive the excess heat and avoid the <b>investment</b> cost <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> an old district heating plant. This means that there are no levies tied to the heat production and electricity used in household heat pumps.

40|$|Cattle {{consuming}} {{tall fescue}} pastures {{infected with the}} endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum often suffer physiological disorders that reduce animal performance. One solution is to replace endophyte-infected tall fescue pastures with an endophyte-free mixture. A benefit-cost analysis was conducted to determine the profitability of pasture restoration. The profitability of this action depends on the percentage of endophyte in existing pastures, the discount rate, and the stand life of the endophyte-free tall fescue variety. Our benefit-cost analysis results indicate {{that in order for}} pasture replacement to be profitable, the existing pastures must be infected with more than 16. 1 % of the endophyte, assuming the stand life of endophyte-free tall fescue is 12 years and the discount rate is three per cent. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the impact on the critical infestation level when the following parameters are changed: the discount rate, the baseline calving rates, and the pasture stand life. This research provides farmers with a practical <b>investment</b> analysis model <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> endophyte-infected with endophyte-free tall fescue pastures. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|Asset Management (AM) {{is a set}} of {{procedures}} operable at the strategic-tacticaloperational level, for the management of the physical asset’s performance, associated risks and costs within its whole life-cycle. AM combines the engineering, managerial and informatics points of view. In addition to internal drivers, AM is driven by the demands of customers (social pull) and regulators (environmental mandates and economic considerations). AM can follow either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Considering rehabilitation planning at the bottom-up level, the main issue would be to rehabilitate the right pipe at the right time with the right technique. Finding the right pipe may be possible and practicable, but determining the timeliness of the rehabilitation and the choice of the techniques adopted to rehabilitate is a bit abstruse. It is a truism that rehabilitating an asset too early is unwise, just as doing it late may have entailed extra expenses en route, in addition to the cost of the exercise of rehabilitation per se. One is confronted with a typical ‘Hamlet-isque dilemma’ – ‘to repair or not to repair’; or put in another way, ‘to replace or not to replace’. The decision in this case is governed by three factors, not necessarily interrelated – quality of customer service, costs and budget in the life cycle of the asset in question. The goal of replacement planning is to find the juncture in the asset’s life cycle where the cost of replacement is balanced by the rising maintenance costs and the declining level of service. System maintenance aims at improving performance and maintaining the asset in good working condition for as long as possible. Effective planning is used to target maintenance activities to meet these goals and minimize costly exigencies. The main objective of this dissertation is to develop a process-model for asset replacement planning. The aim of the model is to determine the optimal pipe replacement year by comparing, temporally, the annual operating and maintenance costs of the existing asset and the annuity of the investment in a new equivalent pipe, at the best market price. It is proposed that risk cost provide an appropriate framework to decide the balance between <b>investment</b> <b>for</b> <b>replacing</b> or operational expenditures for maintaining an asset. The model describes a practical approach to estimate when an asset should be replaced. A comprehensive list of criteria to be considered is outlined, the main criteria being a visà- vis between maintenance and replacement expenditures. The costs to maintain the assets should be described by a cost function related to the asset type, the risks to the safety of people and property owing to declining condition of asset, and the predicted frequency of failures. The cost functions reflect the condition of the existing asset at the time the decision to maintain or replace is taken: age, level of deterioration, risk of failure. The process model is applied in the wastewater network of Oslo, the capital city of Norway, and uses available real-world information to forecast life-cycle costs of maintenance and rehabilitation strategies and support infrastructure management decisions. The case study provides an insight into the various definitions of ‘asset lifetime’ – service life, economic life and physical life. The results recommend that one common value for lifetime should not be applied to the all the pipelines in the stock for investment planning in the long-term period; rather it would be wiser to define different values for different cohorts of pipelines to reduce the uncertainties associated with generalisations for simplification. It is envisaged that more criteria the municipality is able to include, to estimate maintenance costs for the existing assets, the more precise will the estimation of the expected service life be. The ability to include social costs enables to compute the asset life, not only based on its physical characterisation, but also on the sensitivity of network areas to social impact of failures. The type of economic analysis is very sensitive to model parameters that are difficult to determine accurately. The main value of this approach is the effort to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} include, in decision-making, factors as the cost of the risk associated with a decline in level of performance, the level of this deterioration and the asset’s depreciation rate, without looking at age as the sole criterion for making decisions regarding replacements...|$|E
