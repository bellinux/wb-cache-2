5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and <b>future</b> <b>work.</b> At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests.

Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
