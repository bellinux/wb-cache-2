40|$|Background <b>Cuttings</b> <b>and</b> <b>seedlings</b> of Jatropha curcas L. {{were exposed}} to {{different}} regimes of lead (Pb) stress as Pb (NO 3) 2 at 0 (CK), 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mM kg − 1 soil. Objectives The effect of Pb treatment on the root length, tolerance index, photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetic activity, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme was studied in a greenhouse pot experiment. Results The results showed that root lengths and tolerance index decreased with increase of Pb concentration, but tolerance index of cuttings was always {{lower than those of}} the seedlings. For cuttings, Pb treatment had a stimulating effect on chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity at low concentration and an inhibitory effect at higher concentration. For seedlings, SOD activity increased with increasing Pb concentration. In both <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings,</b> Pb caused inhibition of leaf growth and photosynthesis, and induced the membrane damage which was more obvious in the cuttings. In comparison with the control, the dynamic tendency of catalase and perxidase activities in the leaves of Pb-stressed plants all ascended, and then declined. Discussion The increase in enzyme activities demonstrated that seedlings were more tolerant to Pb stress than cuttings. These results also indicate that the antioxidant system may {{play an important role in}} eliminating or alleviating the toxicity of Pb in J. curcas <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The accumulation of Pb increased in a concentration-dependent manner; however, its translocation from root to shoot was low.

There were more deaths associated with Armillaria root rot among cuttings (23 %) than seedlings (13. 5 %) over the same period. No significant difference in height growth was evident between the two types. Although cuttings were smaller in diameter at breast height (a difference of 1. 8 cm at plantation age 6 years and 2. 6 cm at 15 years), annual diameter increments during the period 12 - 15 years after planting were not significantly different. Cuttings had fewer culls as they had less malformation and a more uniform size. Although cuttings had fewer branches in the low pruning zone, seedlings had fewer branches in the high pruning zone, and the pruned butt log over-all (0 - 6 m) contained {{an equal number of}} branches and branch whorls for both <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings.</b> <b>Seedlings</b> had a significantly larger mean branch basal area.

Location Four monsoon rain forest sites, representative of regional major habitat and vegetation types, in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Methods A decadal study involved: (1) initial assessment over 2. 5 years to explore within-year variability in seed rain, dormant seed banks <b>and</b> <b>seedling</b> (< 50 cm height) dynamics; and (2) thereafter, monitoring of <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> sapling (50 cm height to 5 cm d. b. h.) dynamics undertaken annually in the late dry season. On the basis of observations from this and other studies, regeneration syndromes of dominant monsoon rain forest taxa are contrasted with comparable information for dominant woody savanna taxa, Eucalyptus and Corymbia especially. Results Key observations from the monsoon rain forest regeneration dynamics study component are that: (1) peak seed rain inputs of rain forest taxa were observed in the wet season at perennially moist sites, whereas inputs at seasonally dry sites extended into, or peaked in, the dry season; (2) dormant soil seed banks of woody rain forest taxa were dominated by pioneer taxa, especially figs; (3) longevity of dormant seed banks of woody monsoon rain forest taxa, including figs, was expended within 3 years; (4) seedling recruitment of monsoon rain forest woody taxa was derived mostly from wet season seed rain with limited inputs from soil seed banks; (5) at all sites rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedling</b> mortality occurred mostly in the dry season; (6) rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> sapling densities were consistently greater at moist sites; (7) recruitment from clonal reproduction was negligible, even following unplanned low intensity fires. Main conclusions By comparison with dominant savanna eucalypts, dominant monsoon rain forest taxa recruit substantially greater stocks of seedlings, but exhibit slower aerial growth and development of resprouting capacity in early years, lack lignotubers in mesic species, and lack capacity for clonal reproduction. The reliance on sexual as opposed to vegetative reproduction places monsoon rain forest taxa at significant disadvantage, especially slower growing species on seasonally dry sites, given annual-biennial fires in many north Australian savannas...|$|R

Vegetative propagation through rooted cuttings is the industry‟s standard and the choice of clones selected for plantations are determined by their rooting ability. However, as many potentially valuable genotypes are recalcitrant to adventitious rooting, micropropagation is the only effective means of propagating them. Micropropagation results in high plantlet yields, achieved primarily through the empirical use of the key plant growth regulators (PGRs) cytokinins and auxins, for shoot and root production, respectively.

40|$|Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg and O’Donnell is an {{important}} pathogen of pine <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> in South Africa. The fungus causes plant death in nurseries, as well as during establishment of pine plantations. The {{aim of this study}} was to consider the effects of wound type, spore concentration, and environmental stress on infection incidence. Pine seedlings were inoculated using three wounding methods and five spore concentrations. Inoculated seedlings were incubated under optimal environmental conditions, suboptimal conditions, and suboptimal conditions combined with a fungicide treatment. Results showed that the mean percentage infection caused by increasing spore concentrations can be described by the Michaelis–Menten function. The gradient of the function, as well as the asymptotic maximum level of infection, was dependant on environmental stress and the physiological state of the host, as well as the wounding method. Spore concentration had the highest influence on infection incidence in physiologically stressed seedlings. Fungicide treatment did not influence the rate of infection incidence in comparison with the treatments conducted under optimal environmental conditions, but significantly lowered the asymptotic maximum level of infection incidence. Seedlings wounded on the stems had the highest infection incidence, when compared with other wounding methods...|$|R
40|$|Techniques for the {{hydraulic}} restoration of placer-mined streams and floodplains {{were developed in}} Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. The two-year study at Glen Creek focused on a design of stream and floodplain geometry using hydraulic capacity and shear stress equations. Slope and sinuosity values were based on regional relationships. Design requirements included a channel capacity for a bankfull discharge and a floodplain capacity for a 1. 5 - to 100 -year discharge. Several bio-engineering techniques using alder and willow, including anchored brush bars, streambank hedge layering, <b>seedlings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings,</b> were tested to dissipate floodwater energy and encourage sediment deposition until natural revegetation stabilized the new floodplains. Permanently monumented cross-sections installed throughout the project site were surveyed every one to three years. Nine years after the project began, a summer flood caused substantial damage to the channel form, including a change in width/depth ratio, slope, and thalweg location. Many of the alder brush bars were heavily damaged or destroyed, resulting in significant bank erosion. This paper reviews the original hydraulic design process, and describes changes to the channel and floodplain geometry over time, based on nine years of cross-section surveys...|$|R

The cuttings came from 7 -year-old parents. The area had been marked {{for a final}} thinning to a stocking of 200 stems/ha in 1985. Sectional measurements were taken on 38 thinned trees (19 <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> 19 <b>cuttings)</b> in January 1986. The mean diameter at breast height (dbh) and total stem volume under bark were lower in cuttings. However, {{there were significant differences}} in tree form and taper, which resulted in 8 % more total stem volume under bark in cuttings for trees of the same dbh and height. Bark thickness was less in cuttings...|$|R
40|$|Phytohormones {{have been}} at the center of plant {{physiology}} research for more than a century. Research of plant hormones, has at times been considered as a rather vague subject, but the systematic application of genetic and molecular techniques has led to key insights that have revitalized the field. Since the discovery of auxin until today, the relationship of these phytohormones with the development of the root system is very close. In recent decades the role of auxin in the vegetative propagation, especially in the production of seedlings, is important at the stimulation of rooting process of <b>seedlings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cuttings.</b> In this research is examined the stimulation of vegetative propagation of cuttings from aromatic species rosemary (Rosmarinus officinialis L.) and sage (Salvia officinialis L.), using auxins IAA, IBA, NAA and commercial hormone K 1 - Radicin, compared to control K where there is no presence of auxin. Research is carried out in three settings, at two different periods spring/summer and autumn/winter, in adapted plastic tunnel conditions, where some morphological characteristics and the percentage of rooted cuttings were examined. Studies have shown that the use of IAA, IBA and NAA at concentration of 5 ppm may increase the percentage of rooted cuttings in rosemary up to 100...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for biological control by {{a strain of}} Pseudomonas cepacis, selected in vitro for antagonism {{to the growth of}} Phytophthora cinnamomi, was tested for both <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> propagated proteas. Eight species of protea were grown from seed in a modified University of California (UC) potting mix under growth cabinet and glasshouse conditions. In the absence of Pseudomonas cepacia, root infection was recorded in all species 2 months after pot inoculation with Phytophthora cinnamomi. In five species, 60 % or more plants died during the 150 day trial period. Inoculation with Pseudomonas cepacia reduced disease incidence with no root infection being recorded in three species and no deaths in five species. In the remaining three species, plant mortality was reduced, varying from 20 to 40 %. For cuttings propagated under mist in UC potting mix or wedges of Oasis Grow, the presence of Pseudomonas cepacia significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced root infection levels in three of the four species tested in both propagation media. Plant mortality varied from 0 (two species) to 40 % during the 60 day trial period. In the absence of Pseudomonas cepacia, all plants of two species died with no plant deaths occurring in the remaining two species...|$|R
40|$|Aim To explore {{successional}} processes {{associated with}} rain forest expansion in Eucalyptus-dominated woodland savanna vegetation in north-eastern Australia. Location Iron Range National Park and environs, northeast Queensland, Australia. This remote region supports probably the largest extent of lowland (< 300 m) rainforest remnant in Australia. Rainfall (c. 1700 mm p. a.) occurs mostly between November and June, with some rain typically occurring {{even in the}} driest months July-October. Methods (1) Sampling of rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedling</b> distributions, <b>and</b> other vegetation structural attributes, in fifteen 10 x 10 m quadrats distributed equi-distantly between mature rain forest margins (range: 70 - 840 m), at each of 10 sites which were open-canopied vegetation in 1943. (2) Assessment of relationships between rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedling</b> densities <b>and</b> structural characteristics, including distance-to-rain forest-margin, canopy height, stem density. (3) Assessment of lifeform and dispersal spectra for defined vegetation structural types. Results Rates of rain forest invasion {{were found to be}} substrate-mediated. Transects established on hematite schist, diorite, riverine alluvium, and granite developed closed canopies (termed phase III sites) by 1991. The remainder (four transects on poorly drained colluvial/alluvial sediments; one on dune sands) continued to occur either as grassy woodland (phase I), or with developing rain forest understoreys (phase II). Rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedlings</b> were observed at maximum sampled distances from mature rain forest margins at all sites. Lifeform and dispersal spectra data illustrated that: (1) the proportions of woodland trees, shrubs and graminoids declined with successional phase, with concomitant increases in rain forest primary trees and all other lifeform categories save rain forest trees; (2) the proportions of major dispersal syndromes did not vary between successional phases, neither for rain forest nor woodland taxa. Main conclusions Rain <b>forest</b> <b>seedling</b> distribution data for phases I and II sites illustrate three successional processes: margin extension - seedling density significantly negatively correlated with distance from mature rain forest margins at two sites; nucleation - seedling densities significantly positively correlated with tall trees at two sites; <b>and</b> irruption - <b>seedling</b> densities at two sites neither correlated with distance from mature rain forest margins, nor with measured vegetation structural features. The observation of irruptive rain forest regeneration at these sites, combined with decadal-scale rain forest canopy development at the five remaining sites, illustrates that under conditions conducive to growth (moisture, substrate), low fire disturbance, and maintenance of diverse dispersal processes (high frugivore richness), rain forest can rapidly invade regional landscapes...|$|R
40|$|The current E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid {{breeding}} {{strategy of}} South Africa’s Forestry Industry {{is to maintain}} large breeding populations of both parental species in which parents are selected based on their general combining ability (GCA) estimates or predicted individual tree breeding values and are used for interspecific hybrid crosses. The hybrid material is first screened in seedling progeny trials after which superior individuals are selected and tested as clones. Although this strategy has delivered superior clones for commercial production in South Africa, {{it is a time}} consuming strategy to follow and more cost effective strategies are being investigated. In order to review the current hybrid breeding strategy, information on the genetic control of the traits of interest is needed for E. grandis x E. urophylla <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> clonal populations. The main objectives of this study were therefore to firstly estimate genetic parameters for E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> clonal populations; secondly to investigate the correlation between E. grandis and E. urophylla parental (GCA) or individual breeding values and their general hybridising ability (GHA); and lastly to determine the correlation between E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid <b>seedling</b> ortets <b>and</b> their ramets. Results of our study indicated that non-additive genetic variation explained the majority of the total genetic variation in E. grandis x E. urophylla <b>seedling</b> <b>and</b> clonal populations. Due to the pre-eminence of non-additive variance, the pure-hybrid correlations were weak, especially for clonal populations. It would therefore seem that GCA or predicted individual breeding values are not good predictors of GHA for growth performance in the observed populations. Our study also indicated a weak coefficient of correlation between the growth performance of <b>seedling</b> ortets <b>and</b> their ramets. These results suggest that: firstly a hybrid breeding strategy to capture non-additive genetic variation should be adopted; and secondly that the first phase of screening E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid material as seedlings should be revisited.
