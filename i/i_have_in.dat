5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship on one side, and a Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the actual world.|$|E

500|$|According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] {{is about}} [...] "all the rings of {{communication}} around the world.

And that's the idea <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my head– surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." [...] Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} before Whiteside {{was old enough to}} sign schoolboy terms with Manchester United, he was offered a trial at Liverpool, causing United's chief scout Joe Brown to fly over to Belfast to {{immediately}} offer him the schoolboy contract to sign. Whiteside remained in Belfast, and flew over to Manchester every weekend for training. From age 14, he was constantly compared to the now-retired George Best, and did little to cease such comparisons when he told a journalist that [...] "the only thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common with George Best is that we come from the same place, play for the same club and were discovered by the same man".|$|E

500|$|According to the Hitler's Table Talk {{recorded}} that night, the Führer commented: [...] "I distrust {{officers who}} have exaggeratedly theoretical minds. I'd {{like to know}} what becomes of their theories at the moment of action". But when an officer [...] "is worthy of command", he told Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, [...] "he must be given the prerogatives corresponding to his functions". Shortly after Model's departure to Rzhev area, Hitler also stated that: [...] "Generals must be tough, pitiless men, as crabbed as mastiffs– gross-grained men, such as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the Party". Importantly, however, Model never challenged Hitler on political issues: a point that has been identified as the secret to their successful relationship.|$|E
500|$|The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., {{where there}} was a large advance sale. Harris's poor {{direction}} had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, [...] "She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B." [...] Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, [...] "My dear, the only interest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> you is the money I can make out of you." [...] Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as [...] "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.|$|E

[...] Although she told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have [...] "darker elements" [...] in Prism {{following the end of}} her marriage, Perry revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented [...] "I felt very prismatic", which inspired the album's name. [...] "Roar" [...] was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013. It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Unconditionally" [...] was released as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013, and peaked at number 14 in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next.

500|$|... 2001: A Space Odyssey is now {{considered}} one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece. Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In the 1980s, critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him [...] "a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent kick up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder". Poet and critic Dan Schneider wrote that 2001: A Space Odyssey [...] "has one of the greatest screenplays ever penned", countering accusations of the film's coldness by saying, [...] "I recall the HAL ‘death scene’ {{as one of the few}} filmic moments to ever cause me to tear up in sadness. [...] And, in the intervening years, <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> film talks, found that the same scene caused the same emotional reaction in many other viewers. I was not alone. Any film that can both enhance one’s consciousness and touch one’s emotions, simultaneously, evinces greatness." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on November 12, 2009, [...] "The Camel" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.67 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It drew a 2.1 rating/6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, about a five percent drop from the previous week's episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy". The episode received generally positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "The Camel" [...] was a particularly funny episode, and that the parks department's collaboration on the mural allowed [...] "each character being able to instill their own level of brand-specific insanity into the mix". Fowler also praised the sewer department jokes, the [...] "murinal" [...] scene involving Jerry {{and the fact that}} no department ended up winning the mural contest, which Fowler called a commentary on [...] "the futility of local government in their attempts to accomplish anything". The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall declared [...] "The Camel" [...] one of the episodes he would suggest to newcomers seeking to become familiar with Parks and Recreation. Sepinwall said the Ron and Andy subplot [...] "made me laugh as hard as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> a very long time", and said the episode had a good mix of funny, sweet and ridiculous moments, and said the ensemble cast was starting to work extremely well together.|$|E

500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E
