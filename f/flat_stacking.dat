40|$|Several spherically curved {{microchannel}} plate (MCP) stack configurations were studied {{as part of}} an ongoing astrophysical detector development program, and as part of the development of the ALEXIS satellite payload. MCP pairs with surface radii of curvature as small as 7 cm, and diameters up to 46 mm have been evaluated. The experiments show that the gain (greater than 1. 5 x 10 exp 7) and background characteristics (about 0. 5 events/sq cm per sec) of highly curved MCP stacks are in general equivalent to the performance achieved with <b>flat</b> MCP <b>stacks</b> of similar configuration. However, gain variations across the curved MCP's due to variations in the channel length to diameter ratio are observed. The overall pulse height distribution of a highly curved surface MCP stack (greater than 50 percent FWHM) is thus broader than its flat counterpart (less than 30 percent). Preconditioning of curved MCP stacks gives comparable results to <b>flat</b> MCP <b>stacks,</b> but it also decreases the overall gain variations. Flat fields of curved MCP stacks have the same general characteristics as <b>flat</b> MCP <b>stacks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Knowing {{the nature}} of the enzyme-graphene {{interface}} is critical for a design of graphene-based biosensors. Extensive contacts between graphene and enzyme could be obtained by employing a suitable encapsulation which does not impede its enzymatic reaction. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations to obtain an insight on many forms of contact between glucose oxidase dimer and the single-layer graphene nano-sheets. The unconnected graphene sheets tended to form a <b>flat</b> <b>stack</b> regardless of their initial positions around the enzyme, whereas the same graphene sheets linked together formed a flower-like shape engendering different forms of wrapping of the enzyme. During the encapsulation no core hydrophobic residues of the enzyme were exposed. Since the polar and charged amino acids populated the enzyme's surface we also estimated, using DFT calculations, the interaction energies of individual polar and charged amino acid residues with graphene. It was found that the negatively charged residues can bind to graphene unexpectedly strongly; however, the main effect of encapsulation comes from the overlap of adjacent edges of graphene sheets...|$|R

40|$|Use of {{lightweight}} materials {{is an important}} part of reduction of fuel consumption by commercial aircraft. A considerable number of structural aircraft parts are therefore built of thin layers of epoxy pre-impregnated carbon fibres stacked to laminates. Manufacturing these by hand is costly and different methods of automation have therefore been developed. One cost-effective way of manufacturing is Automated Tape Lay-up of <b>flat</b> <b>stacks</b> followed by a Hot Drape Forming operation. A well-known problem in the industry within forming is fibre wrinkling, which can cause a serious strength knock down. The focus of this thesis has therefore been on understanding how and why wrinkles develop during forming of multi-layer stacks and, based on this, investigate different methods for process and material improvements. The work presented initially investigates the dependency between stacking sequence and wrinkle development. It is shown that wrinkle free forming can be obtained by changing the fibre stacking order. In the following investigation it is shown that the wrinkles cannot be entirely eliminated by local stiffening of the critical layers. In a, related study it is shown that different kinds of wrinkles develops during forming; wrinkles may be either due to global buckling of the entire lay-up or local compression of single layers. Global buckling is due to excessive material. Local compression occurs as the material shear during forming. The work presented leads to an understanding of the importance of making the beneficial neighbouring fibre layers interact during forming. One way to connect neighbouring layers is to tailor the interlayer properties. A study is presented that shows how local manipulation of interlayer properties may steer the multi-layered material into a different deformation mechanisms. The manipulation in this thesis is performed using Multi Wall Carbon Nano Tubes, thermoplastic veils or consolidation of thermoplastic toughener particle interlayers. QC 20160425 </p...|$|R

40|$|Structures {{made out}} of {{advanced}} composite materials have significant advantages over those made from metals. The chief advantages are high strength-to-weight ratio, the ability to tailor mechanical properties, high fatigue resistance and good corrosion resistance. The manufacturing methods used to produce these materials {{are different from those}} used to produce metal parts. Composite structures are made from numerous layers of fibrous material which must be prevented from wrinkling during manufacturing to maintain optimal mechanical properties. Manufacturing composite parts without wrinkling can be very difficult when the part has double curvature. In these cases there will be a tendency for the parts to wrinkle as they are shaped. Due to these difficulties many parts are made by hand. This method carries two penalties in that is much slower, and therefore more expensive, than automatic methods and it involves significant hand manipulation of the material resulting in the potential for serious repetitive stress injuries in the workers. The double diaphragm forming process was developed to allow parts of significant double curvature to be made faster and with little hand work. The process involves creating a <b>flat</b> <b>stack</b> of all the layers of material and then forming it into shape between two rubber diaphragms in one step. This process was adapted to a family of structural composite parts, called rib chords, in the Boeing 777 airliner vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer. These parts have considerable double curvature and so present opportunities for large improvements in production rate and ergonomic suitability. Development of a reinforced version of double diaphragm forming has created significant cost savings for manufacturing these parts. A production machine was designed and built to match this process to the production environment for the rib chords. Use of the machine reduces the part flow time by 70 % (Boeing's figure) which translates to significant direct cost savings. The process also reduces the potential for worker injuries dramatically. Not only is the processing improved but significant factory floor space and fabricating equipment are freed up since the one machine can make production quantities easily. Finally the process is very well suited for use in an automated production system creating the opportunity for even more savings in the future. by Samuel B. Truslow. Thesis (S. M.)

The rubber served as the deformation zone between the stiff and brittle silicon stacks and their weaker and ductile aluminium frames. A special test module {{of the same size}} was built with strain gauges of Nichrome (thin film deposited directly {{on the surface of the}} silicon stack). Elastic deformation tests on this as well as simulations using finite element analysis were performed for bending, warping and shearing loads of up to 80, 40 and 99 N, respectively. The test module was disassembled after the test series and examined. The actual thickness of the rubber was measured and entered into the model for simulation. The correlation between simulations and experimental measurements was good with deviation of about 30 %. The results show that the rubber works well as a mechanical interface. Its thickness influences the stress in the silicon stack significantly.
