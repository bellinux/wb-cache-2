40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{effectively}} describe the <b>damage</b> process of composite laminates {{and reduce the}} complexity of material model, a mixed <b>damage</b> model based on Linde Criteria and Hashin Criteria is proposed for prediction of impact <b>damage</b> in the study. The mixed <b>damage</b> model can predict baisc failure modes, including fiber fracture, matrix tensile <b>damage,</b> matrix compressive <b>damage.</b> Fiber <b>damage</b> and matrix <b>damage</b> in compression are described based on the progressive <b>damage</b> mechanics; and matrix <b>damage</b> in tension is described based on Continuous <b>Damage</b> Mechanics (CDM). Meanwhile, for interlaminar delamination, <b>damage</b> is described by cohesive model. A finite element model is established to analyze the <b>damage</b> process of composite laminate. A good agreement is got between <b>damage</b> predictions and experimental results...|$|R
