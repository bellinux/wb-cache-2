5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the <b>future</b> <b>to</b> do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the <b>future</b> <b>to</b> one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} intraday {{dynamics}} of the VIX and VIX futures for the period January 2, 2008 to December 31, 2014. Considering first {{the results of a}} Vector Autoregression (VAR) using daily data, we observe that there is some evidence of causality from VIX <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> the VIX. Estimating a VAR using our ultra-high frequency data, we find strong evidence for bi-directional Granger causality between the VIX and the VIX futures. Overall, this effect appears to be stronger from VIX <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> the VIX than the other way around. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions confirm the dominance of the VIX futures. Lastly, we show that the causality from the VIX <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> the VIX has been increasing over our sample period, whereas the reverse causality has been decreasing. We observe that the VIX futures have become increasingly more important in the pricing of volatility. We further document that the VIX futures dominate the VIX more on days with negative returns, and on days with high values of the VIX, suggesting that those are the days when investors use VIX <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> hedge their positions rather than trading in the S&P 500 index options...|$|R

5|$|As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its {{monetary}} policy responsibilities, {{some of the}} existing money transfer companies are expected in the near <b>future</b> <b>to</b> seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks.

5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its <b>future</b> <b>to</b> a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career. He said he intends to obtain a college degree in the <b>future,</b> <b>to</b> fulfill a promise made to his mother.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} four utility functions - concave, convex, S-shaped, {{and reverse}} S-shaped - {{to analyze the}} behavior {{of different types of}} investors on the Taiwan stock index and its corresponding index futures. Using stochastic dominance (SD) rules, we show that the existence of all four investor types is plausible. Risk averters prefer spot <b>to</b> <b>futures,</b> whereas risk seekers prefer <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> spot. Investors with S-shaped utility functions prefer spot (<b>futures)</b> <b>to</b> <b>futures</b> (spot) when markets move upward (downward). Investors with reverse S-shaped utility functions prefer <b>futures</b> (spot) <b>to</b> spot (<b>futures)</b> when markets move upward (downward). We show that both spot and futures markets can exist when only risk averters are present, but futures can dominate spot only if there is some risk seeking behavior. These results are robust with respect to sub-periods, spot returns including dividends and diversification...|$|R

5|$|In January 2008 the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} that 2,200years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This {{was the biggest}} Antarctic eruption in the last 10,000years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash (or tephra) {{over the surface of}} the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the <b>future,</b> <b>to</b> increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} migration to electronic trading on the relative informational efficiency between an index futures contract and the underlying cash index. The recent move to electronic trading of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index futures contract provides an opportunity to study how the change affects the effective bid and ask spread in the futures market and the dynamic relationship between the futures and the underlying cash index. Our {{findings suggest that the}} migration reduced the effective spread of futures contract. In addition, the information flow from <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> the cash index is strengthened while the instantaneous feedback between futures and cash markets is weakened after the migration. The instantaneous feedback and <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> cash feedback information flow are strengthened in a falling market. However, consistent with the literature, a trading migration from floor to electronic trading reduces the release of lumpy information, which tends to reduce the feedback from <b>futures</b> <b>to</b> cash market.

However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
