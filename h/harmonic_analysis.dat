5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his <b>harmonic</b> <b>analysis</b> to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E
5|$|The algebra of observables {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract <b>harmonic</b> <b>analysis</b> and representation theory.|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of an induction motor may {{be based on}} measuring the electrical signals, such as stator current, electromagnetic flux etc. or mechanical signals such as vibration, noise etc. from the motor. Most of the existing electrical techniques of condition monitoring and fault diagnostics {{are based on the}} stator current and/or leakage flux measurement outside the motor. Besides, most of these methods only concentrate on the time <b>harmonics</b> <b>analysis</b> of the acquired signal. But the main air gap flux consists of both time and space harmonics. The latter is overlooked by most of the existing researches. We propose to analyse the space harmonics of the main air gap electromagnetic flux along with the time domain analysis. But to do so, a thorough knowledge of the space harmonics of the stator flux, the rotor flux and their insights is needed to be obtained. To this aim, we present the space <b>harmonics</b> <b>analysis</b> of the main air gap flux of a healthy induction in this paper. Then the applicability of the space <b>harmonics</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect the faults is discussed.
