40|$|This {{experimental}} work {{was concerned with}} comparison of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> actuation strategies in a thermodynamic single cylinder spark ignition research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on both the inlet and exhaust. The research involved study {{of the effects of}} the valvetrain on combustion, fuel economy and emissions when used to achieve variable valve timing alone and when applied together with early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing for so-called unthrottled operation. The effects of such early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closure were examined using either fully variable events or by simulating two-stage cam profile switching. While fully variable operation enabled the maximum fuel savings over the widest operating map, it was apparent that two-stage switching mechanisms can provide an attractive compromise in terms of cost versus CO 2 benefit on engines of moderate to large capacity. However, from speed-load maps obtained in the current study it would appear that a wide range of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations would be necessary to obtain fuel savings sufficient to warrant a system any more sophisticated than current variable valve timing mechanisms in future aggressively downsized gasoline engines. © IMechE, 2009...|$|R
40|$|This work {{involved}} {{study of}} the effects of alcohol blends on combustion, fuel economy and emissions in a single cylinder research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on the <b>inlet</b> and variable <b>valve</b> timing on the exhaust. A number of splash blends of gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol were examined during port fuel injected early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing operation, both with and without variable valve timing. Under low valve overlap conditions, it was apparent that the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations/lifts required for full unthrottled operation were remarkably similar for the wide range of blends studied. However, with high valve overlap differences in burning velocities and internal EGR tolerances warranted changes in these valve settings. In turn, it was concluded that high ethanol content blends facilitated minimum throttling at the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> itself and the largest relative savings in terms of fuel consumption, engine-out emissions of NOx and (corrected) unburned hydrocarbons.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and outlet valves’ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and outlet valves. The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> in one kind of configuration is {{the same as that of}} outlet valves in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> or the number of outlet valves is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> or outlet valves. It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the charge exchange process in a spark ignition engine has been presented. This process has {{significant impact on the}} effectiveness of engine operation because it is related to the necessity of overcoming the flow resistance, followed by the necessity of doing a work, so-called the charge exchange work. The flow resistance caused by the throttling valve is especially high during the part load operation. The open Atkinson-Miller cycle has been assumed as a model of processes taking place in the engine. Using fully variable <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> timing the A-M cycle can be realized according to two systems: system with late <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing and system with early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing. The systems have been analysed individually and comparatively with the open Seiliger-Sabathe cycle which is a theoretical cycle for the classical throttle governing of the engine load. Benefits resulting from application of the systems with independent <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> control have been assessed {{on the basis of the}} selected parameters: fuel dose, cycle work, charge exchange work and a cycle efficiency. The use of the analysed systems to governing of the SI engine load will enable to eliminate a throttling valve from the system inlet and reduce the charge exchange work, especially within the range of part load operation...|$|R
