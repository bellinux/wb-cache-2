5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign <b>default</b> <b>risk,</b> partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E

25|$|The risk-free asset is the (hypothetical) asset {{that pays}} a risk-free rate. In practice, {{short-term}} government securities (such as US treasury bills) {{are used as}} a risk-free asset, because they pay a {{fixed rate of interest}} and have exceptionally low <b>default</b> <b>risk.</b> The risk-free asset has zero variance in returns (hence is risk-free); it is also uncorrelated with any other asset (by definition, since its variance is zero). As a result, when it is combined with any other asset or portfolio of assets, the change in return is linearly related to the change in risk as the proportions in the combination vary.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes {{the accounts of}} the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S's ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody's reflect expected investor losses {{in the case of}} default. For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure <b>default</b> <b>risk.</b> The process and criteria for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.|$|E

On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's <b>default</b> <b>risk</b> surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower.

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the gross {{redemption}} yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of <b>default.</b> <b>Risk</b> free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} assess how monetary policy rates affect bank risk-taking. In the model, {{a reduction in the}} risk-free rate increases lending profitability by reducing funding costs and increasing the surplus the monopolistic bank extracts from borrowers. Under limited liability, this increased profitability affects only upside returns, inducing the bank to take excessive leverage and hence risk. Excessive risk-taking increases as the interest rate decreases. At a broader level, the model illustrates how a benign macroeconomic environment can lead to excessive risk-taking, and thus it highlights a role for macroprudential regulation.

[...] For ABS, default may occur when maintenance obligations on the underlying collateral are not sufficiently met as detailed in its prospectus.

40|$|What {{explains}} {{variation in}} sovereign borrowing costs, and what role does {{information about the}} state of a country’s financial sector play in the determination of those costs? Investors charge more interest when there are higher <b>default</b> <b>risks.</b> When estimating <b>default</b> <b>risks,</b> investors consider more than explicit public debt levels and include the risk that the financial sector poses to sovereigns in their calculations. Investors are more confident of their assessments when regulators release credible data on the shape and health of their financial sectors. Investors reward more transparent governments with lower sovereign borrowing costs. At the same time, we predict that the effectiveness of transparency declines as public debt increases. Testing this argument requires a measure of transparency, so we create a new Financial Data Transparency (FDT) Index. The Index measures governments’ willingness to release credible financial system data. Using the FDT and a sample of high-income OECD countries, we find that such transparency reduces sovereign borrowing costs. The effects are conditional on the level of public indebtedness. Transparent countries with low debt have lower and less volatile borrowing costs...|$|R
