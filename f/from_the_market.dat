5|$|Within Shepton Mallet {{there are}} several {{distinct}} areas which originated as separate communities around the central point {{of the church and}} Market Place. The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge along the bottom of the river valley {{to the north of the}} town centre, is one of the few parts of the town where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills. Very close by is Cornhill, on which the former prison stands.|$|E
5|$|For {{people with}} relapsed AML, the only proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the monoclonal antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully then {{interview}} Curt Brunjes (Jonathan Whittaker), {{the racist}} {{owner of a}} copy shop across the street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> where Isaac worked. Mulder tells Brunjes that the other two boys, who work for Brunjes, are in danger. Scully mentions {{that there is a}} rumor spreading that Isaac has risen from the grave to avenge his death. The two boys, who are eavesdropping on the conversation, are terrified at this prospect.|$|E
30|$|The {{unidirectional}} linkages {{in terms}} of volatility is observed to be flowing in <b>the</b> following markets: <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of India to China, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Sri Lanka to Japan, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Hong Kong to India, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Pakistan to Sri Lanka, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Pakistan to Hong Kong, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Pakistan to Japan. The unidirectional shock spillover provides the knowledge about the shock that is produced in one market and is transmitted to <b>the</b> other <b>markets</b> while <b>the</b> shock-receiving <b>market</b> does not respond to <b>the</b> shock-sending <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of <b>the</b> highest cross <b>market</b> shock spillover has been found <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Pakistan to Hong Kong (− 0.041) while the lowest has been found <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> of Hong Kong to Sri Lanka (− 0.006). <b>The</b> stock <b>markets</b> of Sri Lanka and Pakistan {{has been found to}} have volatility spillover to most of <b>the</b> selected equity <b>markets.</b> <b>The</b> results of the study are consistent with Joshi (2011).|$|R

5|$|Phenformin, another biguanide, was {{withdrawn}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> {{because of an}} increased risk of lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years). However, metformin is safer than phenformin, and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased except for known high-risk groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} is fairly small {{with a high}} {{proportion}} of empty premises in Market Place and the north end of High Street adjacent to Market Place. However, the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Market</b> Place to Waterloo Bridge has had significant investment in its heritage {{in the last five years}} and now enjoys almost full occupancy of its shops.|$|E
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E

5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Finn Øelund left to head Maersk Air and was {{replaced}} as CEO by Flemming Knudson. Air Greenland opened a route from Copenhagen to Akureyri in Iceland; the service lasted for six years before finally being deemed unprofitable and ended. Also in 2003, SAS abandoned its Greenland service, leading Air Greenland to purchase its second airliner, an Airbus A330-200 named Norsaq. (SAS briefly revived the service during the peak season in 2007 before dropping it again in January 2009.) Owing to SAS's withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> Air Greenland received its contract with the U.S. Air Force for passenger service to and from Thule Air Base. Running from February 2004, the contract was renewed for another five-year period in 2008 despite SAS's brief return to the market.|$|E
5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E

5|$|Neville first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record as the butler of Count Waleran of Meulan in 1138. Neville {{may have been in}} Waleran's service prior to this, {{but this is the first}} secure appearance. For serving as butler, Neville received rents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> dues at Pont-Audemer worth 100 shillings annually. He appears as a witness to a charter of Waleran's to the Abbey of Tiron, which is dated sometime before 1141. Neville witnessed ten other of Waleran's charters, ending in the 1150s.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{remaining}} listed buildings and structures, nine are in or {{very close to}} the market place in the centre of town. They include three former houses (all now shops), a former bank, a telephone kiosk and four stone market place structures. Three cottages, a house and the former Roman Catholic Chapel of St John, are situated within two miles of the town centre. The ages of the listed buildings and structures range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> cross, probably built in the 17th century, to the telephone kiosk, built in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.|$|E

5|$|Playtex Products {{continued}} to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly {{by the late}} 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, and prepared to enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P), makers of Always sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling Rely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Bishop's Palace {{lies within}} the Liberty of St Andrew, which {{encloses}} the cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Vicar's Close and the residences and {{offices of the}} clergy who serve the cathedral. The palace is accessible from the adjacent market place through an archway known as The Bishop's Eye in the gatehouse to the walled precinct. The Bishop's Eye was built around 1450, by Bishop Beckington. It is a three-storey building of Doulting ashlar stone, with a copper roof and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The Bishop's Eye forms one of a pair with the Penniless Porch which is the gateway into the Cathedral <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> place, which was built {{at the same time}} and in a similar style.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug Obetrol following its mandatory withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in 1973 under the Kefauver Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act {{due to the}} results of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
