50|$|Bornaprine is an <b>epimeric</b> {{mixture of}} exo and endo esters, and its major {{metabolites}} {{have been identified}} and include: three isomers of monohydroxy-N-desthel-Sormodren, three isomers of monohydroxy-Sormodren and 5-hydroxyl. Each of these metabolites were hydroxylated at either C-5 or C-6 in the bicyclic ring. The activity of each of compounds has been studied extensively and 5-hydroxyl showed similar anticholinergic activity to the parent compound when tested in isolated rat atrium unlike other identified meatabolites.|$|E
50|$|Dithiothreitol (DTT) is {{the common}} name for a small-molecule redox reagent also known as Cleland's reagent. DTT's formula is C4H10O2S2 and the {{chemical}} structure {{of one of its}} enantiomers in its reduced form is shown on the right; its oxidized form is a disulfide bonded 6-membered ring (shown below). The reagent is commonly used in its racemic form, as both enantiomers are reactive. Its name derives from the four-carbon sugar, threose. DTT has an <b>epimeric</b> ('sister') compound, dithioerythritol (DTE).|$|E
50|$|Since characterization, the {{development}} of synthetic pathways to histrionicotoxin has been of interest to research groups due to its unusual functionality. The Kishi group proposed the first total synthesis of the parent 283A in 1985 using 89, a previously synthesized lactam used for the synthesis of other variants. Treatment with acetic anhydride yielded 133 in quantitative yield. The cyclic enol ether 134 was formed through oxidative cleavage promoting intramolecular addition followed by a basic deprotection and dehydration. Bromination followed by dehydrobromination in methanol was then found to give an <b>epimeric</b> mixture of unsaturated 135. Hydrolysis, reduction and acetylation yielded 136. Formation of a thiolactam followed by condensation with ethyl bromoacetate gave 137. Selective deprotection of the allylic alcohol followed by oxidation gave 138. A Wittig reaction then generated a chloroalkene, which, upon base-promoted elimination of HCl, gave a terminal alkyne, which was subsequently protected to form 139. The olefinic function of 139 was first reduced using cyanoborohydride before further reduction of 140 to an <b>epimeric</b> mixture of alcohols. A retro-Michael addition was then performed under basic conditions at low temperature, successfully epimerising this compound to give the desired epimer 141. A reaction with triphenylphosphine then generated the phosphonium salt 142, and a Wittig reaction could then be performed to attach the silyl-protected cis-ene-yne function, which was then deprotected to yield the target (±)-HTX 283A.|$|E
50|$|Hydrolysis with {{perchloric acid}} afforded {{aldehyde}} 4. A Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky reaction (trimethylsulfonium iodide / n-butyllithium) converted the aldehyde into an epoxide which reacted in situ with the tertiary amine to ammonium salt 5 (contaminated with other cyclization products). Reduction (palladium on carbon/hydrogen) removed the benzyl group to alcohol 6, more reduction (sodium cyanoborohydride) and acylation (acetic anhydride / pyridine) produced 7 as {{a mixture of}} epimers (at C17). Ring closure of ring III to 8 was then accomplished with an aldol reaction using lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (using only the epimer with correct configuration). Even more reduction (sodium borohydride) and acylation resulted in <b>epimeric</b> di-acetate 9.|$|E
50|$|E. J. Corey, in his {{original}} 1969 synthesis of prostaglandins F2α and E2, utilized a Diels-Alder reaction {{early in the}} synthesis to establish the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core. To mitigate isomerization of the substituted cyclopentadiene via 1,5-hydride shift, it was found necessary to keep this intermediate below 0 °C until the Diels-Alder could take place. Thus activation by strongly Lewis acidic cupric tetrafluoroborate was required {{to allow for the}} reaction to take place. The use of 2-chloroacrylonitrile as dienophile is a viable synthetic equivalent for ketene, a structure that typically underdoes a 2+2 cycloaddition to give a cyclobutanone dimer rather than participating in Diels-Alder reactions with 1,3-dienes. Hydrolysis of the <b>epimeric</b> mixture of chloronitrile adducts revealed the desired bicycloheptanone in high yield.|$|E
50|$|In the Bosch {{synthesis}} of (1999, chiral) the olefin group in dione 1 was converted to an aldehyde by ozonolysis and chiral amine 2 {{was formed in}} a double reductive amination with (S)-1-phenylethylamine. The phenylethyl substituent was removed using ClCO2CHClCH3 and the enone group was introduced in a Grieco elimination using TMSI, HMDS then PhSeCl then ozone and then diisopropylamine forming carbamate 3. The amino group was deprotected by refluxing in methanol and then alkylated using (Z)-BrCH2CICH=CH2OTBDMS, to tertiary amine 4. A reductive Heck reaction took place next followed by methoxycarbonylation (LiHMDS, NCCO2Me) to tricycle 5. Reaction with zinc dust in 10% sulfuric acid removed the TBDMS protective group, reduced the nitro group and brought about a reductive amino-carbonyl cyclization in a single step to tetracyclic 6 (<b>epimeric</b> mixture). In the final step to the Wieland-Gumlich aldehyde 7 reaction with NaH in MeOH afforded the correct epimer was followed by DIBAH reduction of the methyl ester.|$|E

The concentration of phytochemicals required for 50 % inhibition ranged from 4. 5 to 300 mu M. Inhibitory plant responses appeared to require that the OH-group at C- 23 be acetylated in photogedunin, since the nonacetylated compound showed less phytotoxic activity...|$|E

40|$|Docetaxel (DTX) is an {{anti-cancer}} compound {{derived from}} 10 -deacetyl baccatin III which is indicated {{for treatment of}} breast, lung, prostate, gastro-esophageal, and head and neck cancers. Epimerization of DTX at the C- 7 hydroxyl position has intrigued chemists and has been implicated in loss of potency, {{as well as in}} the development of resistance in tumour cells. For localized controlled delivery of this agent, silicone films were prepared from a commercially available silicone kit. High levels of <b>epimeric</b> degradants were unexpectedly found in the in vitro releasemedia. Herein,we discuss this anomalous DTX degradation to <b>epimeric</b> impurities, and discuss the possible reasons for degradation. Systematic stability studies were performed on the release media and the silicone kit components. It was found that release media and tin-based catalyst present in the silicone kit could be responsible for the <b>epimeric</b> conversion. This unusual case of chemical incompatibility can affect product performance and can even lead to development of resistance in tumour cells towards DTX. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traditionally, the D-amino acid {{containing}} peptide (DAACP) candidate can {{be discovered}} by observing the differences of biological activity and chromatographic retention {{time between the}} synthetic peptides and naturally occurring peptides. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the exact position of D-amino acid in the DAACP candidates. Herein, we developed a novel site-specific strategy to rapidly and precisely localize D-amino acids in peptides by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) -generated <b>epimeric</b> fragment ions. Briefly, the D/L-peptide epimers were separated by online reversed-phase liquid chromatography and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID), followed by IMS analysis. The <b>epimeric</b> fragment ions resulting from D/L-peptide epimers exhibit conformational differences, thus showing different mobilities in IMS. The arrival time shift between the <b>epimeric</b> fragment ions was used as criteria to localize the D-amino acid substitution. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated by analysis of peptide epimers with different molecular sizes, [D-Trp]-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, [D-Ala]-deltorphin, [D-Phe]-achatin-I, and their counterparts that contain all-L amino acids. Furthermore, the crustacean hyperglycemia hormones (CHHs, 8. 5 kDa) were isolated from the American lobster Homaru...|$|E

40|$|Phytanic acid (PA) is an <b>epimeric</b> {{metabolite}} of the isoprenoid {{side chain}} of chlorophyll. Owing {{to the presence}} of its <b>epimeric</b> beta-methyl group, PA cannot be metabolized by beta-oxidation. Instead, it is metabolized in peroxisomes via alpha-oxidation to give pristanic acid, which is then oxidized by beta-oxidation. PhyH (phytanoyl-CoA 2 -hydroxylase, also known as PAHX), an Fe(II) and 2 OG (2 -oxoglutarate) oxygenase, catalyses hydroxylation of phytanoyl-CoA.
