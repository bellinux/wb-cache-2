25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the aquifers could be recharged on geological time scales by a sequence of sublimation of the frozen seeps, atmospheric circulation of the vapor to the southern polar ice cap, redeposition of this onto the cap, basal melting under the ice mass, and groundwater circulation on a global scale. This mechanism is appealing as it requires little conjecture about radically different past climate, and fits well with independent theories {{on the origins of}} the martian outflow channels at chaos terrains as major aquifer breaches. However, the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>head</b> supplied by this mechanism could not feed the numerous channels at elevations greater than the base of the southern polar cap.|$|E
25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>head</b> in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|E

40|$|In {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} metabolic efficiency in closed photosynthetic reactors, availability of light and CO 2 are often considered as limiting factors, as they are difficult to control in a culture. The carbon source is usually provided via bubbling of CO 2 - enriched air into the culture medium; however, this procedure is not particularly effective in terms of mass transfer. Besides, it leads to considerable waste of that gas to the open atmosphere, which adds to operation costs. Increase in the interfacial area of contact available for gas exchange via use of membranes might be a useful alternative; microporous membranes, in hollow-fiber form, were tested accordingly. Two hollow-fiber modules, different in both hydrophilicity and outer surface area, were tested and duly compared, in terms of mass transfer, versus traditional plain bubbling. Overall volumetric coefficients (KLa) for CO 2 transfer were 1. 48 10 - 2 min- 1 for the hydrophobic membrane, 1. 33 10 - 2 min- 1 for the hydrophilic membrane, and 7. 0 10 - 3 min- 1 for plain bubbling. A model microalga, viz. Nannochloropsis sp., was cultivated using the two aforementioned membrane systems and plain bubbling. The produced data showed slight (but hardly significant) increases in biomass productivity when the hollow-fiber devices were used. However, hollow-fiber modules allow recirculation of unused CO 2, thus reducing feedstock costs. Furthermore, such indirect way of supplying CO 2 offers the additional possibility for use of lower gas pressures, as no need to counterbalance <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>heads</b> exists...|$|R

Management options are being explored using numerical modelling, however, questions remain concerning the appropriate level of sophistication in models, choice of seaward boundary conditions, and how to accommodate heterogeneity and data uncertainty. The choice of seaward boundary condition is important since it affects the amount of salt transported into the aquifers and forms {{the focus of the}} present study. The impact of this boundary condition is illustrated for the seawater-intrusion problem in the Gooburrum aquifers, which occur within Tertiary sedimentary strata. A two-dimensional variable-density groundwater and solute-transport model was constructed using the computer code 2 DFEMFAT (Cheng et al. 1998). The code was tested against an experiment for a steady-state freshwater-saltwater interface and against the Elder (Elder 1967) free-convection problem. Numerical simulations show that the imposition of the commonly-used equivalent <b>hydrostatic</b> freshwater <b>heads,</b> combined with a constant salt concentration at the seaward boundary, results in overestimated seawater intrusion in the lower Gooburrum aquifer.

40|$|Optimization of rock {{support is}} a key for the {{successful}} use of underground space for hydropower development in the Himalaya. Therefore, finding innovative, optimum and economic solution {{will be the only}} way to guarantee on such optimization. A main issue is to find out the extent of hydraulic fracturing and access the water leakage possibility during the operation of such tunnels. The leaked water not only causes economic loss but also may severely affect the stability of tunnel, valley side slopes and the environment. The use of fully concrete/steel lined pressure tunnels against hydraulic fracturing in the rock mass is of costly solution. Hence, it is advantageous to explore possibilities of minimizing the length of the concrete or steel lining in high pressure tunnels and shafts. A proper assessment of hydraulic fracturing of the rock mass plays an important role in this endeavor. This paper evaluates whether or not hydraulic fracturing (splitting) will occur at the 4750 m long shotcrete-lined high pressure headrace tunnel of 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (UTKHEP).

40|$|In {{the present}} report an {{analytically}} based scheme is presented, which allows {{to capture the}} influence of basal solidification onto a spreading flow of liquid melt with poor thermal conductivity. Based on an underlying lubrication theory we derive an approximation for the temperature field and, thus, for the s/l-interface. Solutions are found based on similarity transformations or numerical schemes using the method of lines. Effects due to capillarity or liberation of latent heat are negligible. Solidification occurs at a defined solidification temperature, no mushy solidification regime is presumed. For the temperature field we use a quasi-steady approximation, which leads with respect to reactor safety applications to a conservative result for the crust influence onto the spreading flow. Furthermore, we assume both thermal conductivity and density to be constant and equal in the liquid and solid phases. The spreading flow is characterized in terms of Reynolds number Re, Froude number Fr, Prandtl number Pr and an aspect ratio #epsilon#. For the spreading volume we allow for V#propor to#t"#alpha#, {{which leads to a}} characterization of all possible spreading flows in terms of the exponent #alpha#.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has been used}} to analyze the flow fields generated by FDG in the quasi-stagnant configuration to allow that technology to give simultaneous measurements of deposit thickness and strength. Stress field predictions were generated by solving the governing equations using the numerical solver Fastflo™, and validated by comparison with experimental hydrostatic pressure measurements. Moreover, an analytical approximation for the shear stresses imposed during the gauging experiments has been shown to yield reasonably good agreement with the CFD predictions. Particular predictions of note were that the surface shear stress is largest in the area directly underneath the rim of the gauging nozzle, and that shear stresses characteristic of industrial cleaning-in-place systems could be generated in these quasi-stagnant systems by suitable selection of the <b>hydrostatic</b> suction <b>head</b> and the clearance between the gauging nozzle and the surface. This enhanced FDG tool was employed to study the removal characteristics of tomato paste soils and weak calcium sulphate scale deposits. The critical shearing yield stress for the tomato paste was found to be strongly dependent on the extent of baking (ageing), approaching an asymptote as the material was transformed from a soft, malleable paste into a hard, brittle semi-solid. It was also found that after extended deposition and ageing, calcium sulphate layers could not be removed by these gauging flows, implying that liquid velocities customarily used in industry {{would not be able to}} dislodge such deposits. Polystyrene co-polymer fouling layers were fabricated in the laboratory. The kinetics and mechanisms of cleaning them from stainless steel surfaces using NaOH, MEK and TPU solvents were successfully investigated using FDG. NaOH was found to be a non-solvent across the range of experimental conditions, in the sense that the polymer films simply swelled to constant thickness after an induction period, without dissolving. In contrast, the polymer films were removed completely in MEK and TPU, more rapidly in the former case, in terms of swelling and dissolution rates, and overall cleaning time. The removal characteristics of different polymer films in MEK and TPU were shown to differ fundamentally, and an improved 'campaign' strategy for polymerization reactors is thereby identified. Experiments on pilot plant samples immersed in MEK and TPU indicated that the results from the laboratory samples are applicable to pilot plant scale.

40|$|Water {{transport}} {{in green}} plants {{is important for}} maintaining plant life and numerical researches taking account of the anatomy of plants have been presented {{in the view of}} agricultural engineering and plant physiology. Recently, in crop science and horticulture the effects of the environment on the transpiration stream have been investigated quantitatively. However, there is not enough of quantitative and reliable data based on simultaneous measurement for the rates of the transpiration and absorption {{because of the lack of}} a simple and accurate method of measurement under natural conditions. Water movement must be investigated more thoroughly in the connection between these data and plant physiology. Modeling and measurement of driving forces and resistances to water movement : To investigate a mechanism of transpiration stream, the suction pressures for water absorption and transfer resistances of three organs, i. e., leaves, stem, roots, were measured by the potometer method. Suction p ressures due to the leaves and roots were determined from the conditions of zero-absorption rate, which was attained by the reduction of the <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure <b>head</b> applied on the roots immersed in the water. Three values of the resistances were estimated by the three kinds of experiments. Based on the experimental results, a simple model for water absorption was developed. Some results predicted by the model were well consistent with measured data. Development of a method of simultaneous measurement for transpiration and absorption rate : In the developed method in the case of plants immersed in the water, two electronic balances were used. A balance weighs water in the bath for measuring the absorption loss, and the other balance weighs the only plant, root of which are to be floated in the water bath, for measuring the absorption minus transpiration loss. Transpiration loss of water is obtained by the sum of two balances. In the case of the roots in the soil, a potted plant in the soil is to be floated in the water bath. In this case the effect of buoyant force on absorption must be considered. Using these method, instantaneous and accurate measurements were attainable. Experiments of plant responses to environment : Step responses of water movement to illumination and atmospheric temperature, and to cutting of roots were examined, using the above-mentioned method. Relation between the transpiration and absorption, aspect of pulsation of water movement were investigated by using the plants in the water and those in the soil. It was noted that the transpiration rate showed the large overshoot from the steady value and in phase lag to the absorption rate. On the other hand, those phase relation by cutting the roots was conducted reversely. 本研究では, 2 台の電子天秤による同時測定により,蒸散および吸水の瞬間流量を計測する簡便な手法を提案し,環境変化に対する蒸散・吸水量の微視的な応答解析に応用した。特に,過渡応答として,光照度のステップ変化に対し吸水量は蒸散量に対し位相が遅れ,蒸散量は定常値をオーバーシュートすること,根を切断した場合や渇水状態において十分な水分を根部に供給するとき吸水量が蒸散量より位相が進むことを明らかにした。定常特性として,植物の成長が盛んなとき吸水量が蒸散量を上回ること,根部が土壌中にある場合は蒸散・吸水流量が脈動しやすいこと,植物のしおれの影響,根部が水中および土壌中にある場合の比較などを実験的に明らかにした。これらの結果は,過渡応答計測や長時間自動計測に有効な吸水・蒸散量の同時計測法の開発によって明確にされたものである。 一方,吸水量をポトメータ法により測定し,根がある植物および根を切断した植物に対し根部の静水圧を減少させ吸水量が零となる静水圧の測定,茎部の流動抵抗の測定,茎部断面の道管直径・道管本数の顕微鏡撮影の結果から,葉部の吸水圧(駆動圧),根部吸水圧および葉・茎・根の各部流動抵抗を実測した。これらのデータは従来,ほとんど公表されていない。以上の計測結果を基に,吸水圧の和が流動抵抗の和と釣り合うとする簡単な吸水モデルを構築した。本実験により,供試植物(ピレア) の葉部:根部の吸水圧比が 9 : 1 であり,植物器官の流動抵抗比は葉:茎:根が 1 : 1 : 1. 5 であることを示した。また,葉および根による吸水圧は葉の枚数に依存せず一定であり,本モデルにより吸水量は葉の枚数(表面積) に比例するのではないことを明らかにした。さらに,根部の吸水圧が大気圧以上になると,過剰な吸水量となるため根は吸水力源でなく内部抵抗源となることを見いだした。研究成果として, 4 回の口頭発表を行った。研究課題/領域番号: 09650181, 研究期間(年度) : 1997 – 1999, 平成 11 (1999) 年度 科学研究費補助金 基盤研究(C) 研究成果報告書の一部(概要) を掲...|$|R
