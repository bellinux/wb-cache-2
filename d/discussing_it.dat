5|$|Renji {{also finds}} {{out that it is}} her dream to write a fantasy novel, but due to her {{condition}} has never been able to get far. Renji loves to read novels, and after <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with Chihiro, he collaborates with her to see if he can finally make her dream come true. Through the process of writing the novel, the two eventually become very close and they fall in love with each other. As the story progresses and more of the novel is written, Renji soon discovers that the novel is an allegory for Chihiro's life and how she sees the world around her due to the state of her limited memory.|$|E
5|$|The {{appeal was}} heard and {{dismissed}} the following day, Thursday, 12 March 2015. As {{part of its}} legal argument, aside from raising safety concerns, Sauber also submitted that van der Garde's contract had been terminated by the team in February {{with the approval of}} the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s Contract Recognition Board in any event, and that van der Garde violated confidentiality clauses of the contract by <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with the media. Lawyers representing Ericsson and Nasr further argued that van der Garde had not followed due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action. The court upheld the previous orders to permit van der Garde to participate in the race and adjourned the hearing to the following day, Friday, 13 March 2015, to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der Garde's legal team against Sauber's team principal, Monisha Kaltenborn.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E

5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight. Gupte said his character keeps the frame unpredictable {{and that it}} provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish. He worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from European and Japanese cinema. Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid {{that he did not have}} much time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E
5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E

25|$|Apollo program {{director}} Sam Phillips {{was quoted as}} saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all.|$|E
25|$|Finally, on February 1, 1854, the {{railroad}} ran a train through Erie without change. But civil disturbances continued for years. Townspeople were assaulted, {{the local newspaper}} was torn down and the ruins burnt, and the Presbyterian church split in two. The matter caused such hard feelings that people avoided <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> for years afterwards {{in order to avoid}} starting arguments.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} intention {{with the}} album was to make it entirely electronic, which fit the themes found in the songs well. However, after <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> with Ed, Arjen decided he would be remiss not to utilize Ed's abilities, and did re-record the drum section. Interestingly, when {{the album was}} first released in 1996, prior to Ed's association with Arjen, Ed commented to people {{he knew that he}} felt the record should have utilized real drums.|$|E

25|$|The US {{was kept}} apprised of this research. While <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> {{in the fall}} of 1941, Bowen and Alvarez entered a heated debate about the proper antenna design for ground mapping systems. Bowen was {{convinced}} that the antenna had to be highly accurate in both azimuth and elevation, in order to provide reasonable resolution. Improving resolution over that of H2S would either require larger antennae that would be unwieldy, or decreasing the wavelength of the transmitter beyond the state of the art.|$|E
25|$|The vice {{president}} believed {{he read the}} Robert Novak column in the newspaper on {{the day it was}} published, 7/14/03. He cannot recall <b>discussing</b> <b>it</b> or any of its contents with anyone {{at the time it was}} published. He did not pay any particular attention to Novak's disclosure of the identity of Valerie Wilson, and he does not know how Novak might have received such information. He emphasized it did not appear to him to be an important or even relevant fact in the Joe Wilson controversy.|$|E
25|$|The Loebner Prize {{provides}} an annual platform for practical Turing Tests {{with the first}} competition held in November 1991. It is underwritten by Hugh Loebner. The Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts, United States, organised the prizes {{up to and including}} the 2003 contest. As Loebner described it, one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research, at least in part, because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing Test despite 40 years of <b>discussing</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|Novelist Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was {{critical}} of the superior attitude of Westerners who claimed a higher aestheticism in purporting to have discovered ukiyo-e.
