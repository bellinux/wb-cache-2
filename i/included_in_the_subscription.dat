However, the High Holy Days are usually peak attendance days for synagogues and temples, often filling or over-filling synagogues. For this reason many synagogues issue tickets for attendance and may charge for them: practice varies on whether paid-up synagogue members must also buy these or whether it is <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscription.</b> [...] Synagogues never pass a collection plate during services as some churches do, as Jews are forbidden to touch money on the Sabbath or other holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Among synagogues in the United States, donations are often sought during the Kol Nidre service, called the [...] "Kol Nidre Appeal," [...] often via a pledge card, where the amount of the donation is represented by a paper tab which can be bent down in the amount of donation desired. Rabbis and other temple representatives say that holiday ticket sales represent a significant source of revenue.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{a rental}} firm that offers {{reusable}} products to price- and quality-of-service-sensitive customers [...] Netflix or Blockbuster {{can be thought}} of as the canonical example. Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under <b>the</b> pay-per-use option. <b>In</b> a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option is more profitable for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option does not necessarily dominate <b>the</b> pay-per-use option <b>in</b> quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> option. subscription services, pay-per-use services, operational benefits, pricing, capacity sizing, finite customer population, loss system, on-off model, diffusion approximation...|$|R

40|$|Content-based publish/subscribe systems allow {{matching}} {{the content of}} events with predicates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> However, most existing systems only allow a limited set of operators, such as comparison on primitive data types (string, integer, etc). In this paper, we consider a publish/subscribe system that supports more flexible events/subscriptions {{with the use of}} advanced, yet potentially expensive, matching operators. Examples of such operators are pattern recognizers on multimedia data and spatial operators on location data. We study a critical problem in these publish/subscribe systems, namely how to optimize the matching process for a large number of subscriptions. This is achieved by exploiting <b>the</b> overlap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscriptions</b> and sharing <b>the</b> operator evaluation results whenever possible. We formulate <b>the</b> optimal <b>subscription</b> evaluation problem and show that it is NP-Hard. We propose an efficient d-approximation algorithm, where d is the maximum number of operators in one subscription, as well as a heuristic algorithm that can further improve <b>the</b> system performance <b>in</b> practice. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithms can reduce the matching cost by up to 80 %, as compared to a naive strategy that evaluates <b>the</b> <b>subscriptions</b> independently...|$|R

Two questions related to consolidation are investigated. The first relates to the extent to which consolidation between regional newspapers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same area leads to a change <b>in</b> either <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> price or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real advertising costs. The second investigates whether a merger between newspaper publishing companies leads to a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>subscription</b> price of their newspapers or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real advertising costs. Newspapers that were directly or indirectly involved in consolidations did not show a more detrimental pricing behavior to consumers than the other dailies. ...|$|R
