5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E

Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> 50% and by 2020 <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> 35%.|$|E

Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the uppermost flag.

5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

5|$|For a fully {{secret trust}} to be valid, therefore, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations.
