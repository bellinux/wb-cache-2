40|$|Global and hemispheric temperatures, {{greenhouse}} gas concentrations, solar irradiance, and anthropogenic sulfate aerosols all have increased {{during the last}} {{one hundred and fifty}} years. Classical linear regression techniques will indicate a positive relationship among such series whether or not such a relation exists. Such standard techniques cannot, therefore, show whether observed temperature increases are the result of anthropogenic climate change. However, recent developments in econometrics allow for the analysis of relationships between statistically non-stationary data. We apply some of these recently developed tests in order to uncover the presence of stochastic trends in global climate change variables. These tests indicate that the {{greenhouse gas}}es are characterized by I(2) stochastic trends while they fail to find evidence of an I(2) stochastic trend in hemispheric temperature series. This would mean that there is no simple long-run equilibrium relationship between radiative forcing and temperature. We then use a multivariate structural time series model to decompose Northern and Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperatures</b> into stochastic trends and autoregressive noise processes. This method does not suffer from some of the disadvantages of the standard tests. The results show that there are two independent stochastic trends. The first is I(2) and is shared by the Northern and Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperatures.</b> It {{may be related to the}} to the radiative forcing variables and represent a global warming signal. The second trend is I(1) and is only present in Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This trend seems closely related to the radiative forcing due to tropospheric sulfates. ...|$|R

The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England.

40|$|The Earth’s {{climate system}} {{is driven by}} a complex interplay of {{internal}} chaotic dynamics and natural and anthropogenic external forcing. Recent instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity between Northern Hemisphere and Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations, thereby questioning {{the relative importance of}} internal versus external drivers of past as well as future climate variability 1, 2, 3. However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere 4, 5, limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction with an independent Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> reconstruction ensemble 5, this record reveals an extended cold period (1594 – 1677) in both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the pre-industrial (1000 – 1850) era. The current (post- 1974) warm phase is the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to overemphasize Northern Hemisphere–Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by underestimating the role of internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics, particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external climate forcing and Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> variations 5, 6 alone...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{methodology}} used in Mann et al. (1998) for computing their northern <b>hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> index was flawed. We {{show that the}} distinctive hockey-stick shape of their temperature reconstruction is primarily due to tree ring sites that exhibit non-linear or non temperature-related 20 th century growth and to a questionable step in their principal components algorithm that overweights these series. Problems with early segments of other “key indicators” are identified. Without these problematic series and without their biased principal component analysis, Mann et al. are not entitled {{to conclude that the}} 20 th century was uniquely warm based on their data and methods. In a recent paper 1 (herein MM 03), we developed an updated and corrected version of the climate proxy data set used by Mann et. al. 2 (MBH 98) to compute a Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> index. The most significant changes were the replacement of obsolete versions of proxy data used in MBH 98 with current versions from the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology (WDCP) and the use of conventional principal component analysis to reduce networks of tree ring chronologies to regional aggregates using the maximum period in which all 1 sites were available.

40|$|Climate reconstructions {{based on}} proxy records require steps of {{standardization}} {{of the different}} series prior to their calibration to instrumental data. In a recent publication in GRL, McIntyre and McKitrick [2005 a] suggest that the procedure applied to North American tree ring records led to a systematic bias in the famous “hockey stick ” series of Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> [Mann et al. 1998, 1999]. We show that this claim is unfounded, and that a proper standardization, independent of the reference period applied, leads to essentially the same result.

Of these, the pattern-based reconstruction by Mann, Bradley and Hughes [Mann et al., 1998 : MBH below] has attracted particular attention, in part because it was featured prominently in the IPCC Third Assessment Report [Houghton et al., 2001].

Here we use high-resolution records of sediment colour [...] a measure of terrigenous versus biogenic content [...] from the Cariaco Basin off the coast of Venezuela and the Arabian Sea to assess teleconnections with the North Atlantic climate system during the last glacial period. The Cariaco record indicates that the intertropical convergence zone migrated seasonally over the site during mild stadial conditions, but was permanently displaced south of the basin during peak stadials and Heinrich events. In the Arabian Sea, we find evidence of a weak Indian summer monsoon during the stadial events. The tropical records show a more variable response to North Atlantic cooling than the Greenland temperature records.

40|$|International audienceComparison between proxies for {{atmospheric}} circulation and temperature reveals associations {{over the last}} few decades that are inconsistent with those of the past 2000 years. Notably, patterns of middle to high latitude {{atmospheric circulation}} in both hemispheres are still within the range of variability of the last 6 ? 10 centuries while, as demonstrated by Mann and Jones (2003), Northern Hemisphere temperatures over recent decades are the highest of the last 2000 years. Further, recent temperature change precedes change in middle to high latitude atmospheric circulation unlike the two most notable changes in climate of the past 2000 years during which change in atmospheric circulation preceded or coincided with change in temperature. In addition, the most prominent change in Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> and atmospheric circulation of the past 2000, and probably 9000 years, precedes change in temperature and atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere unlike the recent change in Northern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>temperature</b> that leads. These findings provide new verification that recent rise in temperature is inconsistent with natural climate variability and is most likely related to anthropogenic activity in the form of enhanced greenhouse gases. From our investigation we conclude that the delayed warming over much of the Southern Hemisphere may be, in addition to other factors, a consequence of underpinning by natural climate variability. Further bipolar comparison of proxy records of atmospheric circulation demonstrates that change in atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere led by 400 years, the most abrupt change in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation of the last 9000 years.
