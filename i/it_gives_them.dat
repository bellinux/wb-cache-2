25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a bright green colour—which {{has been described}} as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. Baking soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine to tenderize meats. Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|E

25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> {{the feeling of}} immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E
25|$|Newly {{recruited}} guerrilla fighters had {{to follow}} a two months basic military training program {{that is different from}} the physical training (PT) programs. The basic training consists of having to identify firearms and getting used to specific models and their physical operation, such as the Russian AK-47 and U.S. M16 assault rifles, as well as mortar rifles and basic communication systems. The PT programs are separate from the main training schedule, as they are included in the day-to-day life of a guerrilla, by climbing mountains, running with loads, participating in the digging of military trenches, making bunkers and occasionally also some swimming programs taking place in natural water resources such as rivers and lakes. Playing of soccer is another activity available to all male and female guerrillas as <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a proper mental relaxation. FARC clearly advises all guerrilla commanders to avoid assigning barely trained guerrillas directly in the front lines, establishing that they only have to serve in rear lines when coming fresh from basic training.|$|E
25|$|Often retirees {{are called}} upon to care for grandchildren and {{occasionally}} aged parents. For many <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> more time to devote to a hobby or sport such as golf or sailing. On the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression {{as a result of their}} new situation. Although it is not scientifically possible to directly show that retirement either causes or contributes to depression, the newly retired are one of the most vulnerable societal groups when it comes to depression most likely due to confluence of increasing age and deteriorating health status. Retirement coincides with deterioration of one's health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression.|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Jill Berry, {{president}} of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as Holby City as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: [...] "The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, {{as long as they}} give a realistic impression." [...] Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from Holby City as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} the film's accuracy, Burton explained, [...] "it's {{not like a}} completely hardcore realistic biopic. In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some {{of the film is}} trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it." [...] Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating {{he did not want to}} ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, [...] "I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy– saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one [...] Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|The 150-person team {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} first-person shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players. Despite having prior knowledge on how {{these types of}} games work, the team decided to study historic examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's London Iranian Embassy siege, 1997's Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theater hostage crisis {{to ensure that the}} portrayal of these operations was accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism units, such as the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation. According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> an objective and a priority. They must be careful in dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive. To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called [...] "living hostage" [...] to govern the hostage character's behavior – e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding herself if there is nearby gunfire.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star sounds like he pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E

Teams usually hold {{many of the}} remaining 15 players of the 40-man major league roster whom the major league club has chosen not {{to play at the}} major league level. Players at Triple-A on the 40-man roster can be invited to come up to the major league club once the major league roster expands on September 1, although teams usually wait until their affiliates' playoff runs are over, should they qualify. For teams in contention for a pennant, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> fresh players.

This reliance is especially evident in Western medicine. Even so, Heidegger makes ang allusion to this reliance {{in what he calls}} the allure or [...] "character of exactness." [...] In effect, people are inherently attached to [...] "exactness" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a sense of purpose or reason {{in a world that is}} largely defined by what appears to be [...] and irrationality.

2500|$|Duck stance: Useful for tricks by {{removing}} the forward bias altogether, the feet are angled outwards in opposite directions, such as 15° for the front foot and -6° for the back foot. This stance is becoming increasingly popular, and is the most resilient of the three. The feet do not actually have to be angled equally outwards to be considered duck stance. [...] The back foot simply has to be angled less than zero degrees. These angles give the rider a dominant front foot angle at all times which {{makes it easier for}} a rider to change the board direction mid-run. This change in board direction mid-run is called riding [...] "Switch" [...] or [...] "Fakie". Duck stance is also very popular for park riders because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> the versatility to move their board in all directions. It is easier to spin, balance on rails and boxes, and land [...] "switch" [...] when one's feet are both angled outward. The degree of the angle depends on the individual.|$|E
