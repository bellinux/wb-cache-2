5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E

He reportedly gave a long speech praising cockfighting, in a joking manner, to Emperor Gia Long and sometimes beat the drum himself <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the actors and actresses of the hát bội troupes when they were performing for him. He was also known for his patronage of goddess spirits that were popularly venerated by local southerners in folk religions. In addition, Duyệt was the instructor of three đình formalities, a code of ceremonial conduct and customs that were copies of royal rituals.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> competition for services between countries.

The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands.

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually {{from the bottom up}} and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the French and the Iroquois was strained long before the Lachine Massacre, as the French maintained relations with other tribes as well, for both trade and war alliances, such as the Abenaki. In 1679, {{following the end of}} the Iroquois war with the Susquehannock and the Mahican, the Iroquois raided native villages in the West. Pushing out Siouan tribes to the west, they claimed hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley by right of conquest. These were kept empty of inhabitants <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> hunting. As a result, the Iroquois regularly raided trading parties in the western frontier which was under French protection, and took loot from them. Following military confrontation in 1684, though the Iroquois negotiated a peace treaty with New France governor Le Febvre de la Barre, the treaty stated the Iroquois were free to attack the western Indians. The French Crown objected to the treaty, and replaced LaBarre with the Marquis de Denonville. He was less sympathetic to native relations, and did not pay attention to the Iroquois-Algonquian tensions. In part, the Iroquois attacked the French because they were not willing to accept constraints against their warfare related to traditional Iroquois enemies.|$|E

5|$|Though {{now into}} his forties, Lee {{remained}} a regular in the Middlesex {{side in the}} early 1930s, and in 1931 he scored 1,291 runs {{at an average of}} 30.02, including two centuries. Both of his brothers, Jack and Frank, also scored a first-class century during the season, Jack scored 113 for Somerset against Northamptonshire, and Frank carried his bat to remain 134 not out for Somerset against Sussex. The feat was the first instance of three professional brothers all scoring first-class centuries in the same season. Two years later, all three brothers were involved in a dismissal: Harry Lee was caught for 82 runs by Frank from the bowling of Jack. Though Lee passed 1,000 first-class runs in each of 1932 and 1933, he did so with averages under 25, and in 1934 he was dropped from the Middlesex side <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>encourage</b> some younger players to break into the team. He continued to appear for the MCC during the season, and scored a century against Cambridge University in early July. He was briefly recalled to the Middlesex team in August, and recorded a final century, reaching 119 against Warwickshire. Although he was successful in the subsequent match against Surrey, making scores of 65 and 38 not out, Middlesex terminated his contract {{at the end of the}} season, much to his disappointment. In 437 first-class appearances, Lee scored a total of 20,158 runs at an average of 29.95. He scored 38 centuries and passed 1,000 runs in a season on 13 occasions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Indonesia is a {{developing}} country that began to utilize information technology in education. A form of its implementation {{is the use of}} e-learning. However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution.
