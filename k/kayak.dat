5|$|Germany won {{the most}} medals with 18 medals and seven golds. Men's canoe's overall winner was Russia with seven medals (one gold, five silver and one bronze). In men's <b>kayak,</b> {{the big winner}} was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's <b>kayak.</b> Athlete {{comments}} ranged from disgust over the format adjustment made to the canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships will hopefully push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.|$|E

50|$|Modern sea <b>kayaks</b> {{come in a}} {{wide array}} of materials, designs, and sizes to suit a variety of {{intended}} uses. In sea kayaking, where the designs continue along primarily traditional lines, the primary distinction is between rigid <b>kayaks</b> and folding <b>kayaks.</b> Folding <b>kayaks</b> are in some ways more traditional boats, being similar in design to skin-on-frame <b>kayaks</b> used by native people. Modern folding <b>kayaks</b> use ash and birch or contemporary materials such as aluminum for the frame, and replace the sealskin covering with synthetic waterproof fabrics. Unlike native <b>kayaks,</b> folding <b>kayaks</b> can be easily disassembled and packed for transport. Many folding <b>kayaks</b> include inflatable sponsons that improve the secondary stability of the vessel, helping to prevent capsize. More recently, a class of inflatable folding <b>kayaks</b> has emerged, combining a more limited rigid frame with a tightly inflated skin to produce greater rigidity than an inflatable boat alone.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, the county began {{preparing}} for future renovations to <b>Kayak</b> Point County Park to support new developed areas and replace aging equipment. Proposals for the beachside area include additional camping areas, a community center, and environmental education exhibits; upland areas could receive new camping yurts, permanent cabins, and a ranger station.|$|E
5|$|Through {{partnerships}} with Kent State University Recreational Services {{and other local}} agencies, additional recreational opportunities are available to city residents. A livery known as Crooked River Adventures is available at Tannery Park. The livery generally operates from May to October depending on weather and water levels. Canoe, <b>kayak,</b> tubing, and bicycle rentals are available to residents and students with <b>kayak</b> and canoe service as far as Brust Park in Munroe Falls and Water Works Park in Cuyahoga Falls. Kent also has a bicycle-sharing system known as Flashfleet {{in partnership with the}} university and PARTA. The program offers yearly memberships or hourly rentals with locations on campus and in the downtown area.|$|E
5000|$|Sea <b>kayaks</b> are {{typically}} designed for travel by one, two or even three paddlers on open water {{and in many}} cases trade maneuverability for seaworthiness, stability, and cargo capacity. Sea-kayak sub-types include [...] "skin-on-frame" [...] <b>kayaks</b> with traditionally constructed frames, open-deck [...] "sit-on-top" [...] <b>kayaks,</b> and recreational <b>kayaks.</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} design {{approaches}} for the bow, stern, and deck of <b>kayaks.</b> Some <b>kayaks</b> have upturned bows, which {{are meant to}} provide better performance when paddling into waves, as well as better wave-shedding ability. Other <b>kayaks</b> achieve this through increased buoyancy in the bow. <b>Kayaks</b> with unobstructed stern decks may ease certain types of self-rescue. Waterproof bulkheads in modern <b>kayaks</b> provide flotation {{in the event of}} capsize.|$|R
2500|$|Whitewater <b>kayaks</b> {{differ from}} sea <b>kayaks</b> and {{recreational}} <b>kayaks</b> {{in that they}} are better specialized to deal with moving water. [...] They are often shorter and more maneuverable than sea <b>kayaks</b> and are specially designed to deal with water flowing up onto their decks. Most whitewater <b>kayaks</b> are made of plastics these days, although some paddlers (especially racers and [...] "squirt boaters") use <b>kayaks</b> made of fiberglass composites. Whitewater <b>kayaks</b> are fairly stable in turbulent water, once the paddler is skillful with them; if flipped upside-down, the skilled paddler can easily roll them back upright. This essential skill of whitewater kayaking is called the [...] "Eskimo Roll", or simply [...] "Roll." [...] <b>Kayaks</b> are paddled in a low sitting position (legs extended forward), with a two-bladed paddle. See Whitewater kayaking.|$|R
5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called <b>Kayak</b> that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a <b>kayak</b> to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's {{first ever}} Olympic {{competitor}} in canoe and <b>kayak,</b> Mostafa Mansour, {{qualified for the}} 2012 Games. Having taken up the sport in 2007, after abandoning his initial pursuit of rowing, Mansour qualified for the K-1 200 metres by coming in third in the event at the 2011 All-Africa Games. The Olympic spots were originally meant {{to go to the}} top two finishers, Greg Louw of South Africa and Mohamed Mrabet of Tunisia, but South Africa did not select Louw for the Games. Mansour's best time in the K-1 1000 metres earned him a spot in that event as a continental wildcard. He was eliminated in the opening round of both events in London, after finishing last in his heats.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary traditional-style <b>kayaks</b> {{trace their}} origins {{primarily}} to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Wooden <b>kayaks</b> and fabric <b>kayaks</b> on wooden frames dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were first introduced in the US, and inflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in Europe. Rotomolded plastic <b>kayaks</b> first appeared in 1973, and most <b>kayaks</b> today are made from roto-molded polyethylene resins. The development of plastic and rubberized inflatable <b>kayaks</b> arguably initiated the development of freestyle kayaking {{as we see it}} today, since these boats could be made smaller, stronger and more resilient than fiberglass boats.|$|R
50|$|Five {{different}} models cover the Recreational <b>Kayaks</b> and Sea Kayak/Touring Spectrum. They range from maintenance free <b>kayaks</b> {{such as the}} Regal and Riviera to sophisticated touring <b>kayaks</b> such as the Journey and Rogue.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>kayaks</b> differ {{greatly from}} native <b>kayaks</b> in every aspect—from initial form through conception, design, {{manufacturing}} and usage.

5|$|Fossil Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, <b>kayak,</b> and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the Fossil Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, Fossil Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} year, Sisimiut {{is served}} twice-weekly by coastal ferries of Arctic Umiaq Line which link the {{communities}} of the western coast. There is also a weekly Royal Arctic Line ferry to Itilleq and Sarfannguit. The port in Sisimiut is the northernmost year-round ice-free port in Greenland, serving as the country's primary maritime base north of Nuuk. Supply ships from the port head north, serving the entire coast, from the Uummannaq Fjord region, through Upernavik Archipelago, to Qaanaaq in the far north. M/S Akamalik, {{one of the largest}} ships in the fleet of Royal Greenland, is based in Sisimiut. Home to the first shipyard of Greenland dating from 1931, the port also handles more than 50 cruise liners per year. The local <b>kayak</b> club operates at the bay harbor east of the port.|$|E
5|$|In a 25 August 2009 ICF article, ICF Canoeing for All Committee and Canoe <b>Kayak</b> Canada's Domestic Development Director John Edwards thanked {{efforts of}} the paddlers {{involved}} in the paddleability events for the 2009 championships. Edwards stated that the efforts for paddleability's success are twofold. The first is for inclusion into the 2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Athens, Greece. Once this is recognized, the next {{goal is to get}} Special Olympic programs at a national level for inclusion into the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The second, a shorter-term one, is to have 24 nations from three continents participate at next year's canoe sprint world championships in Poznań. Besides the medalists from this year's world championships being from Italy, the United States, Canada, Brazil and France, other participants included Great Britain and Portugal. The process to include paddleability into the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began on 1 October 2009 and approval was reached on 16 July 2010.|$|E
5000|$|Today many fishing <b>kayaks</b> are {{available}} {{that have the}} stability and buoyancy to act as diving <b>kayaks.</b> An example is [...] "Finn", a small manufacturer in Perth, Australia. [...] "Feelfree" [...] and other brands also make suitable <b>kayaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company began}} making <b>kayaks</b> in 1995. In 2000 {{the company was}} making more <b>kayaks</b> than canoes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>kayaks</b> {{have become}} very popular as high-performing playboats of Freestyle athletes. Many of the world's leading Freestyle paddlers use Jackson <b>kayaks,</b> and Jackson <b>Kayak's</b> {{sponsorship}} {{of some of the}} best Freestyle kayakers in the world adds to this development (see below).|$|R
5|$|Princes Park {{obtained}} {{its name}} {{during a visit}} by the Duke of Windsor as Prince of Wales in 1931. Located at {{the eastern end of}} the seafront, it has a children's playground with paddling pool, cafe, bowls and a large lake, noted for its swans. The lake is used by a nearby water-sports centre, which offers <b>kayak</b> and windsurfing training. Princes Park lake is also home to Eastbourne Model Powerboat Club and Eastbourne Model Yacht Club. Close by are tennis and basketball courts and a football pitch. At the north of the park is Eastbourne United F.C.. Devonshire Park, home to the pre-Wimbledon ladies tennis championships, is located just off the seafront in the towns cultural district. Other parks include: Helen Gardens and the Italian Gardens at the western end of the seafront, Sovereign Park between the main seafront and the marina and Motcombe Gardens in Old Town.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney. Courtney became a {{commando}} recruit in mid-1940, and {{was sent to the}} Combined Training Centre in Scotland. He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that his idea of a folding <b>kayak</b> brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the <b>kayak</b> helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
