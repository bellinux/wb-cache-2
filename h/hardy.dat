40|$|We give a {{analytic}} quantitative {{relation between}} <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality and Bell operator. We find that <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality is a sufficient condition for violation of Bell inequality, the upper bound of <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality allowed by information causality just correspond to Tsirelson bound of Bell inequality, {{and the upper}} bound of <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality allowed by the principle of no-signaling just correspond to the algebraic maximum of Bell operator. Then we study the Cabello's argument of <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality (a generalization of <b>Hardy's</b> argument) and find a similar relation between it and violation of Bell inequality.

The quantum circuit is constructed on superconducting qubits corresponding to the original <b>Hardy's</b> test of non-locality. Results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled state of two qubits violates <b>Hardy's</b> Equations, whereas any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit <b>Hardy's</b> non-locality. We also point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of any <b>Hardy's</b> paradox based quantum protocol and propose three performance measures for any two qubits of any quantum computer...|$|R
