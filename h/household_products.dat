5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other <b>household</b> <b>products</b> and cooking utensils.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{application of}} the latent Markov model for assessing developments by individuals through stages of a process. This approach is applied by using a database on ownership of 12 financial products and various demographic variables. The latent Markov model derives latent classes, representing <b>household</b> <b>product</b> portfolios, and shows the relationship between class membership and household demographics. The analysis provides insight into switching between the latent classes, reflecting developments of individual <b>household</b> <b>product</b> portfolios, {{and the effects of}} demographics on such switches. Based on this, we formulate equations to predict future acquisitions of financial products. The model accurately predicts which <b>product</b> a specific <b>household</b> unit acquires next, for most of the products. © 2007 Royal Statistical Society...|$|R

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and <b>household</b> <b>products</b> arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
