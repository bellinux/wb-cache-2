40|$|Roller {{drafting}} is {{the most}} commonly used method for strand attenuation. A typical roller drafting device consists <b>of</b> multiple <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rollers,</b> each <b>pair</b> moving at a succes-sively faster speed, attenuating the fiber strand. The dis-tance between the two adjacent <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>rollers</b> is set according to the fiber length to avoid fiber damage. How-ever, because staple fibers have different lengths (even for synthetic fibers of identical length, the projected length along the strand is not uniform), shorter fibers are not always fully grabbed or controlled by the drafting rollers. They are referred to as “floating ” fibers, and their move-ment is unpredictable. The floating fibers tend to move in bunches, causing irregularity in the strand drafted, which are called “drafting waves”. 1 To reduce drafting waves, attachments are ofte...|$|R

40|$|Ring-rolling is an {{industrial}} forming process for producing high-strength seamless metal rings up to 6 m diameter. Thick-walled cylindrical rings of material, typically metallic alloys, are compressed between {{two or more}} internal and external rollers and rotated until a target geometry, often outer diameter, is achieved. A common plant configuration is that <b>of</b> a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> radially acting <b>rollers</b> and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> axial <b>rollers,</b> the radial-axial ring rolling (RARR) machine. The most commonly produced product geometries have an axisymmetric cross-section profile. However, during the forming process the cross section is changed significantly as it passes through each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>rollers.</b> This irregular shape hinders geometry state measurement and this complicates modelling {{and control of the}} process. Recent developments in sensing capabilities offer high resolution measurement of ring geometry during forming. In this work, we present advances in these sensing techniques, a numerical method for storing and predicting the ring’s geometrical state and control laws to achieve a nonaxisymmetric cross-section profile in rolled rings using existing RARR plant hardware...|$|R
