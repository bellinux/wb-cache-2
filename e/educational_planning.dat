5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} <b>educational</b> <b>planning</b> for the post-war years. He {{played a major}} role in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures on adult education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to reserve officer status on 19 April 1946.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to show the {{standpoint}} of Slovenian teachers towards the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> in primary schools and also to describe how an <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> is made. In the theoretical part I have defined the area of education and described the role and objectives of education in public schools. I have paid {{special attention to the}} <b>educational</b> <b>plan,</b> where I presented what the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> represents, how it is made and what content does it include. In the empirical part I have been researching the meaning and attitude of teachers towards the <b>educational</b> <b>plan.</b> For the {{purpose of the}} research I have made a questioner, which has been taken by 86 teachers from 10 Slovenian schools. The results have shown that teachers have a very positive standpoint towards the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> and that the majority of them evaluate the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> as important. The majority of teachers have justified the importance of the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> with the argument, that the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> provides a unified educational functioning environment for teachers, they have also pointed out that the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> of the school is formed in a team, with the participation of all employees of teaching staff, but only a few have mentioned the collaboration with students or their parents. The majority of teachers surveyed are satisfied with their profession and when planning their lessons, they do follow the educational effects of teaching, which means that they are {{aware of the importance of}} education in schools...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} the bachelor´s work is Utilization of the <b>educational</b> <b>plans</b> {{in the care of}} cardiac patients. Heart & blood vessels {{diseases}} belong to the civilisation diseases. Circular system diseases are the most frequent cause of death in the advanced countries of the western civilisation, including the Czech Republic. The theoretical part is focused on heart and blood vessels anatomy, ischemic cardiac disease, education, the methods and forms of education of cardiac patients, where dietary measures, physical burden in cardiac patients, the possibility of balneotherapy and other recommendations for cardiac patients are described. The bachelor´s work has two goals Goal 1. To find out whether education of cardiac patients is being done in selected cardio centres, who provides the education, whether they have <b>educational</b> <b>plans</b> in the selected cardio centres and whether they utilize them and what is the effect of the education. Goal 2. To create and realize an own <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> in cardio centre at hospital in České Budějovice. For these goals, 6 research questions have been set. RQ 1. Is education of cardiac patients being done in the selected cardio centres? RQ 2. Does the nurse participate in the education? RQ 3. Do they have an <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> in the selected cardio centres? RQ 4. Do they utilize the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> in the selected cardio centres? RQ 5. Does the education of cardiac patients have a positive effect in keeping regime and curative measures? RQ 6. Is the created <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> going to {{have an effect on the}} knowledge and skills of a patient? A qualitative form of research, by the technique of semi-standardised interview has been used for the achievement of the goals. The research set consisted of 8 selected cardio centres and 8 cardiac patients who were hospitalized at hospital in České Budějovice. After the qualitative research has been conducted, answers were acquired. Answer 1 : Education of cardiac patients is being done in all cardio centres. Answer No. 2 : General nurse takes part in the education of cardiac patients. Answer No. 3 : Only 3 out of 8 selected cardio centres have an <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> created. Answer No. 4 : Most of the cardio centres don´t have an <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> created. An <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> is utilized only in 3 cardio centres where they have created it. Answer No. 5 : The education of cardiac patients has a positive effect in keeping curative and regime measures. Answer No. 6 The created <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> has a positive influence on the knowledge and skills of patients. There was only 1 patients where the <b>educational</b> <b>plan</b> had no effect, 4 patients started to change their food habits. It is very important that the people know the risk factors of ischemic heart diseases and the possibilities of prevention. A properly conducted education will mediate this information to people and therefore it would be suitable to train the medical staff working in the cardio centre at Hospital in České Budějovice, for an education of cardiac patients.

500|$|Many of Strom's policy {{initiatives}} revolved around education and youth. [...] He created the Alberta Service Corps, which allowed young Albertans to work summers on public services and environmental projects for remuneration, {{and which was}} one of several models for the federal government's later Katimavik program. [...] In response to increasing use of illicit drugs by Alberta youth, his government, led by Education Minister Bob Clark, inserted anti-narcotics messages into the province's school curriculum. [...] Strom implemented trial kindergarten programs in Edmonton and Calgary—the Calgary program, provided jointly by an inner-city community association and the Mount Royal College, has been called one of Canada's first public-private partnerships. [...] His interest in educational matters was perhaps best exemplified by his government's Commission on <b>Educational</b> <b>Planning,</b> which travelled the province to solicit Albertans' views and whose final report, A Choice of Futures, was credited by Barr as setting [...] "the tone and direction for education in Alberta for the next generation". [...] The Strom government also made substantial reforms to Alberta's post-secondary education system, expanding distance learning through the creation of Athabasca University and laying the foundation's for ACCESS television, and effectively creating the province's College (as distinct from University) system.

[...] Nineteen per cent of the variance was explained in the <b>educational</b> <b>plans</b> of males, and 20 per cent {{of the variance in}} the <b>educational</b> <b>plans</b> of females. For males, the independent variables in order of their effects upon <b>educational</b> <b>plans</b> from high to low were: child's IQ, family size, mother's education, father's education, father's occupation, parental presence, and mother's occupational status. Of the three intervening variables examined, parental encouragement was the most important, parental awareness was less important, and parental decision-making was the least important.
