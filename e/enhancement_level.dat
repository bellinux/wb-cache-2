With the help of multiple SR, the devices with low power that are in weak coverage condition can boost the signal strength.

The impact of such a device on the preference for enhanced video was tested for people with impaired vision and normally sighted viewers. Viewers with impaired vision preferred the enhancement effects more than normally sighted viewers. Preference for enhancement was correlated with loss in contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. Preference increased with increased enhancement settings (designed for those with normal vision) in the group with vision impairments.

A comparison of the simulated local strain fields during shock front propagation with those measured by image correlation provides an additional proof {{of the validity of}} such simulations. Very simple rate insensitive phenomenological constitutive model are used in such simulations. It shows that the shock effect is captured numerically with a basic densification feature. It means that strength enhancement due to shock should not be integrated in the constitutive model of foam-like materials used in industrial FE codes. In order to separate shock enhancement from entire strength enhancement, an improvement of an existing model with easily identifiable parameters for shock enhancement prediction is proposed. For a quick estimate of the shock <b>enhancement</b> <b>level,</b> a simple power law densification model is proposed instead of the classical RPPL model proposed by Reid and co-workers (Tan et al. 2005).

High resolution analysis of stars in these clusters allows us to characterize {{them in terms of}} kinematics, metallicity, and individual abundances, and to compare these fingerprints with those characterizing field populations. We present iron and element ratios for seven red giant stars in the globular cluster NGC 6723, based on high resolution spectroscopy. High resolution spectra (R∼ 48 000) of seven K giants belonging to NGC 6723 were obtained with the FEROS spectrograph at the MPG/ESO 2. 2 m telescope. Photospheric parameters were derived from ∼ 130 FeI and FeII transitions. Abundance ratios were obtained from line-to-line spectrum synthesis calculations on clean selected features. An intermediate metallicity of [Fe/H]=- 0. 98 ± 0. 08 dex and a heliocentric radial velocity of v_hel=- 96. 6 ± 1. 3 km s^- 1 were found for NGC 6723. Alpha-element abundances present enhancements of [O/Fe]= 0. 29 ± 0. 18 dex, [Mg/Fe]= 0. 23 ± 0. 10 dex, [Si/Fe]= 0. 36 ± 0. 05 dex, and [Ca/Fe]= 0. 30 ± 0. 07 dex. Similar overabundance is found for the iron-peak Ti with [Ti/Fe]= 0. 24 ± 0. 09 dex. Odd-Z elements Na and Al present abundances of [Na/Fe]= 0. 00 ± 0. 21 dex and [Al/Fe]= 0. 31 ± 0. 21 dex, respectively. Finally, the s-element Ba is also enhanced by [Ba/Fe]= 0. 22 ± 0. 21 dex. The <b>enhancement</b> <b>levels</b> of NGC 6723 are comparable to those of other metal-intermediate bulge globular clusters.

Their <b>enhancement</b> <b>levels</b> were compared quantitatively in the areas of interest by determining Hounsfield units in the aorta and parenchyma of the abdominal organs, and qualitatively by using an independent evaluation by a radiologist. Measurements were made on the GE Lightspeed 64 -detector row CT scanner with pressure injector. No parameters were changed during the entire study, enabling the maintenance of standard conditions for high-quality comparisons in all examinations. Patients with any significant lesion in the organ to be measured were excluded from the study measurements, and patients at risk of circulation disorder (patients with severe conditions, such as heart failure, shock, and others) were also not enrolled. A contrast agent with a constant amount of iodine amounting to 300 mg/mL was used for the measurements. The study population comprised 120 patients, of which 51 were women and 69 men. The following data were recorded for each measurement: examination number, age, sex, body weight, HU values, and radiologists evaluation. The data were recorded in tables and further analyzed. Various HU <b>enhancement</b> <b>levels</b> were compared and evaluated and subsequently correlated with the radiologists evaluation. Optimal values of the amount of contrast agent were also compared with those routinely used at the facility concerned.

Two conditions of cavity resonance have been analyzed separately: (1) for TE polarization (electric field parallel to the grooves) and (2) for TM polarization (magnetic field parallel to the grooves). When dimensions are chosen according to the first condition, the enhancement of TE fields is found to increase with the height-to-width ratio, and it is accompanied with a decrease in the bandwidth. The same <b>enhancement</b> <b>levels</b> can be achieved for TM fields if the second condition holds, provided that the period-to-width ratio is large enough.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of forced convection heat transfer in a narrow rectangular duct fitted with a circular tube and/or a delta-winglet pair. The duct was designed to simulate a single passage in a fin-tube heat exchanger. Heat transfer measurements were obtained using a transient technique in which a heated airflow is suddenly introduced to the test section. High-resolution local fin-surface temperature distributions were obtained at several times after initiation of the transient using an imaging infrared camera. Corresponding local fin-surface heat transfer coefficient distributions were then calculated from a locally applied one-dimensional semi-infinite inverse heat conduction model. Heat transfer results were obtained over an airflow rate ranging from 1. 51 x 10 - 3 to 14. 0 x 10 - 3 kg/s. These flow rates correspond to a duct-height Reynolds number range of 670 – 6300 with a duct height of 1. 106 cm and a duct width-toheight ratio, W/H, of 11. 25. The test cylinder was sized such that the diameter-to-duct height ratio, D/H is 5. Results presented in this paper reveal visual and quantitative details of local fin-surface heat transfer distributions in the vicinity of a circular tube, a delta-winglet pair, and a combination of a circular tube and a delta-winglet pair. Comparisons of local and average heat transfer distributions for the circular tube with and without winglets are provided. Overall mean finsurface Nusselt-number results indicate a significant level of heat transfer enhancement associated with the deployment of the winglets with the circular cylinder.

Segregation to boundary defects that cause trapping states can remove these interfacial traps, and segregation to other boundary sites can create a degenerately-doped interfacial layer. The electrical consequences of this segregation are considered, and by comparison of the measured resistivity changes with temperatures with those predicted from these simple models it is proposed that the major contribution to the resistivity in heavily-doped polycrystalline silicon comes from scattering of carriers by the high density of positive charge at the grain boundaries...|$|R

Arrays of stationary jets are usually impinged on surfaces of internal cooling passages. The current practice is {{to benefit from the}} high heat transfer coefficients existing {{in the vicinity of the}} jet impingement region on a target wall. The present study shows that a self-oscillating impinging-jet configuration is extremely beneficial in enhancing the heat removal performance of a conventional (stationary) impinging jet. In addition to a highly elevated stagnation line Nusselt number, the area coverage of the impingement zone is significantly enhanced because of the inherent sweeping motion of the oscillating coolant jet. When an oscillating jet (Re= 14, 000) is impinged on a plate normal to the jet axis (x/d= 24 hole to plate distance), a typical enhancement of Nu number on the stagnation line is about 70 %. The present paper explains detailed fluid dynamics structure of the self-oscillating jet by using a triple decomposition technique on a crossed hot wire signal.
