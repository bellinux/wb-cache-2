50|$|When used in imagers, {{correlated}} <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> is a {{noise reduction}} technique {{in which the}} Reference Voltage of the pixel (i.e., the pixel’s voltage after it is reset) {{is removed from the}} Signal Voltage of the pixel (i.e., the pixel’s voltage at the end of integration) {{at the end of each}} integration period.|$|E
50|$|Correlated <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> (CDS) is {{a method}} to measure {{electrical}} values such as voltages or currents that allows removing an undesired offset. It is used often when measuring sensor outputs. The output of the sensor is measured twice: once in a known condition and once in an unknown condition. The value measured from the known condition is then subtracted from the unknown condition to generate a value with a known relation to the physical quantity being measured.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A single sampled faecal immunochemical test (FIT) has {{moderate}} sensitivity for {{colorectal cancer}} and advanced adenomas. Repeated FIT sampling could improve test sensitivity. The {{aim of the}} present study is to determine whether any of three different strategies of <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> has a better combination of sensitivity and specificity than single FIT sampling. Methods Test performance of single FIT sampling in subjects scheduled for colonoscopy was compared to <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> intra-individually. Test positivity of <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> was evaluated in three different ways: 1) "one of two FITs+" when at least one out of two measurements exceeded the cut-off value, 2) "two of two FITs+" when both measurements exceeded the cut-off value, 3) "mean of two FITs+" when the geometric mean of two FITs exceeded the cut-off value. Receiver operator curves were calculated and sensitivity of single and the three strategies of <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> were compared at a fixed level of specificity. Results In 124 of 1096 subjects, screen relevant neoplasia (SRN) were found (i. e. early stage CRC or advanced adenomas). At any cut-off, "two of two FITs+" resulted in the lowest and "one of two FITs+" in the highest sensitivity for SRN (range 35 - 44 % and 42 %- 54 % respectively). ROC's of <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> were similar to single FIT sampling. At specificities of 85 / 90 / 95 %, sensitivity of any <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> strategy did not differ significantly from single FIT (p-values 0. 07 - 1). Conclusion At any cut off, "one of two FITs+" is the most sensitive <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> strategy. However, at a given specificity level, sensitivity of any <b>double</b> FIT <b>sampling</b> strategy for SRN is comparable to single FIT sampling at a different cut-off value.

50|$|Eric Fossum, et al., {{invented the}} image sensor that used intra-pixel charge {{transfer}} {{along with an}} in-pixel amplifier to achieve true correlated <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> (CDS) and low temporal noise operation, and on-chip circuits for fixed-pattern noise reduction, and published the first extensive article predicting the emergence of APS imagers as the commercial successor of CCDs. Between 1993 and 1995, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a number of prototype devices, which validated the key features of the technology. Though primitive, these devices demonstrated good image performance with high readout speed and low power consumption.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of digital image sensors used in products like mobile phones and GoPro cameras traces back to NASA JPL scientist Eric Fossum {{who wanted to}} miniaturize cameras for interplanetary missions. Fossum invented CMOS image sensors that has became NASA's most ubiquitous spinoff technology, enabling the use of cameras inside mobile phones. Fossum {{found a way to}} reduce the signal noise that had plagued earlier attempts at CMOS imagers, applying a technique called intra-pixel charge transfer with correlated <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> that results in a clearer image, this {{led to the creation of}} CMOS active pixel sensors, which are used today in all smartphone cameras and many other applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor—the so-called 4T cell. The pinned photodiode was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in soft reset. The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing single and the <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plans for monitoring dependent production processes. Based on simulated samples from the process, Nelson proposed a new approach of estimating the characteristics of single sampling plans and, using these estimates, designing optimal plans. In this paper. we extend his approach {{to the design of}} optimal <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plans. We first propose a simple methodology for obtaining the unbiased estimators of various characteristics of single and <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plans. This is achieved by defining the various characteristics of sampling plans as explicit random variables. Some of the important properties of the <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plans are established. Using these results, an efficient algorithm is developed to obtain optimal <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plans. A comparison with a crude search shows that our algorithm leads to about 90 % savings, on the average, in computational timings. The procedure is also explained through a suitable example for the ARMA(1, 1) model. It is observed, for instance, that an optimal <b>double</b> <b>sampling</b> plan leads to about 23 % reduction in average sample number, compared to an optimal single sampling plan.
