5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
25|$|<b>House</b> <b>lights</b> provide {{light on}} the theater's seats and aisles for the {{audience}} before and after performances and during intermissions. They are generally incandescent lights, however fluorescent lights or scoops {{may be used in}} some instances. <b>House</b> <b>lights</b> are often controlled by dimmers, but are sometimes on simple switches. Worklights provide general lighting backstage or in the house, and are often fluorescent fixtures. Work lights are almost always non-dimmed.|$|E
25|$|House {{and work}} lights are usually off during {{performances}} but are occasionally {{included in the}} lighting design to establish focus or emphasize plot elements. When the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> are not on a dimmer, the switch is usually {{under the control of}} the stage manager.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the San Martinian Society {{requested}} to fence the monument {{after it was}} repeatedly vandalized. The request was dismissed by the city council, that considered that it would affect the aesthetics of the monument. In 2012, the municipal government of Neuquén made renewals on the monument. The Public Buildings and Transit Secretariat replaced the quicklime tiles of the roundabout for porphyr ones, that formed a sun-and-star shape. The National University of Comahue {{was in charge of}} the new illumination of the monument. On each of the twelve pointers of the star, metal cilynders were built to <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> that pointed toward the pedestal. Additional reflectors were placed on the top of the base to illuminate the statue.|$|E
25|$|PAR {{lights are}} often used in {{theatrical}} or live music shows. Commonly {{they are used to}} generate colours by fitting them with colored sheets called gels. The cans are arranged into rows of different colours and identical rows placed on different sides of the stage. Due to their affordability, they are ideal for colour washes in several different colours. However, {{because of the lack of}} control over the beam diameter, shape and sharpness, PARs are rarely used as front of <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> other than for front washes but can be used for special effect lighting such as lighting from directly above or from extreme angles as well as general wash lights overhead/above stage. If used cleverly, par cans can provide low budget productions with good effects.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{features}} a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that [...] "to start the film with the candles being lit... {{would be a}} rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins." [...] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to {{a world in which}} smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent [...] "just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope." [...] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. She points out that normally the woman of the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.|$|E

During her second Thanksgiving television special, Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular, which aired on ABC, Gaga sang [...] "Gypsy" [...] as a duet with Kermit the Frog. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticised the performance saying that [...] "Kermit was earnest and well , but it didn't feel like {{the product of a}} Lady Gaga and The Muppets special; it felt like Kermit making a cameo in a Lady Gaga special, a problem given the shared billing in the title." [...] Conversely Rolling Stones Marissa Muller listed it as one of the five memorable moments from the special. Gaga performed [...] "Gypsy" [...] as the encore to her 2014 show at South by Southwest. It was the also the closing song of Gaga's 2014 [...] tour. She sang it wearing long white wig and a dress with a long white train. During some of the shows, Gaga brought audience members onstage to sing the song together. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone criticised the choice of the song as the show's finale, saying that it felt anticlimactic. [...] "After a one-song encore of 'Gypsy', the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> came up... it was startling to realize the show was already over. [...] didn't have superstar moves or hits saved up for the big finale—she decided not to do a big finale at all," [...] he concluded.|$|E

2500|$|As police arrived, the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> {{were brought}} up and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to {{surrender}} saying, [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} part of the 17th century, theater {{performances}} took place twice a week, starting at two or three o'clock. [...] Theatrical representations often encompassed several works; they began with a comic prologue, then a tragedy or tragicomedy, then a farce and finally a song. [...] Nobles sometimes sat at the side of the stage during the performance. [...] Since it was impossible to lower the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> the audience was always aware of each other, and spectators were notably vocal during performances. [...] The place directly in front of the stage, without seats—the parterre—was reserved for men, but since these were the cheapest tickets the parterre was usually a mix of social groups. [...] Elegant people watched the show from the galleries. [...] Princes, musketeers and royal pages were given free admission. [...] Before 1630, an [...] "honest" [...] woman did not go to the theater. Unlike England, France placed no restrictions on women performing on stage; however, the career of actors of either sex was seen as morally wrong by the Catholic Church (actors were excommunicated) and by the ascetic religious Jansenist movement. [...] Actors typically had stage names referring to typical roles or stereotypical characters.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Bogdanov's 1978 RSC {{production}} at the Aldwych Theatre, starring Jonathan Pryce and Paola Dionisotti. In this modern dress production, after the <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> went down, nothing happened on stage for a moment. Then, a commotion arose from within the audience. The <b>house</b> <b>lights</b> came back on, {{and a member of}} the audience (Pryce) is seen to be in altercation with an usherette (Dionisotti). After pushing the usherette to the ground, the man then clambered onto the stage, and began to smash parts of the set before being restrained by the usherette and theatre staff, stripped and thrown into a bath. The subsequent play was then presented as his dream. At several performances of the play, audience members were duped into thinking the fight between the man and the usherette was real, and several times, other audience members attempted to intervene in the conflict. This production very much embraced a feminist reading of the play, presenting the taming as a distasteful display of male chauvinism, with the process presented as Sly's dream of male domination and power over the usherette who had restrained him. In this version, Katherina delivers the final speech (with the men sitting not at a dining table but a poker table) in a toneless, lifeless voice, and although Petruchio appeared thoroughly ashamed of what he had done to her, he still collected his winnings from the other men before leaving. Dionisotti's own feelings about her delivery of the speech was that it was [...] "full of affection for women." [...] She also felt the production had a very bleak ending; [...] "the last image was of two very lonely people. The lights went down as we left - I following him, the others hardly noticing we'd gone. They'd got down to some hard gambling. They just closed ranks around the green baize table." [...] Michael Billington was especially complementary, praising Bogdanov for the honesty shown in [...] "his approach to this barbaric and disgusting play [...] Instead of softening its harsh edges like most recent directors, he has chosen to emphasise its moral and physical ugliness." [...] Graham Holderness argues of this production, [...] "Bogdanov was concerned to stress the continuities between the mercantile ethics of Renaissance Padua and the commercial values of modern-day British capitalism; between the oppression of women in Shakespeare's time, and the continuing exploitation of sex today; between the class-divisions of the sixteenth century and the economic inequality of the twentieth." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{a concert}} in October 2002, at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, someone in the {{audience}} yelled out a request for [...] "Summer of '69," [...] a hit by the similarly-named Bryan Adams.

He eventually found the fan who made the joke request, paid him $30 cash as a refund for the show, ordered him to leave, {{and said he would}} not play another note until he had left. In a 2014 interview, Ryan Adams denied that the audience member was asked to leave [...] "for screaming a Bryan Adams song", but rather because the man was drunk: [...] "The reason why the guy ever was asked to leave by me was because I was doing an a capella three-piece with Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, and myself of ‘Bartering Lines,’ and in between the quiet parts the guy was screaming." [...] In April 2015, Ryan, who had since become friends with Bryan, played [...] "Summer of '69" [...] at the end of another performance at the Ryman, an act described by Rolling Stone as [...] "an olive branch to the city that was once his home." ...|$|E
