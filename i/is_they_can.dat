25|$|Many {{software}} {{programs have been}} developed that intercept the data stream as it is decrypted out of the DRM-restricted file, and then use this data to construct a DRM-free file. These programs require a decryption key. Programs that do this for Blu-ray Discs, DVDs, and HD DVDs include universal decryption keys in the software itself. Programs that do this for iTunes audio, PlaysForSure songs, and TiVo ToGo recordings, however, rely on the user's own key â€“ that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only process content the user has legally acquired under {{his or her own}} account.|$|E

25|$|Most BWR and PWR {{commercial}} reactors use uranium enriched {{to about}} 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors {{with a high}} neutron economy do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use natural uranium). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency {{there are at least}} 100 research reactors in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment uranium). Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).|$|E
25|$|It is now {{possible}} to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in {{the gravity of the}} planets and moons of the Solar System. For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth's Trojan points. Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chemical}} reactions are reversible, that <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing {{with each other}} and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.|$|E
