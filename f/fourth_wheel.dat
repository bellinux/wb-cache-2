50|$|The center wheel {{drives the}} pinion {{of the third}} wheel, and the third wheel drives the pinion of the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> In watches with the seconds hand in a {{subsidiary}} seconds dial, usually located above the 6 o'clock position, the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> is geared to rotate once per minute, and the second hand is attached directly to the arbour of this wheel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> - In clocks {{and watches}} {{with the second}} hand in a subdial on the face, this turns once per minute, and the shaft {{projects}} through the face and holds the second hand. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also turns the escape wheel pinion. Many clocks don't need this wheel, because of their slower moving escapements, and in these the third wheel drives the escape wheel directly.|$|E
50|$|Recumbent four-wheel cycles {{have the}} same general {{advantages}} of tricycles. For quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle. More wheels introduce more weight and more complexity. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road. When two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the fourth rotor did not catch Bletchley Park by surprise, because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to its development as an adaptation of the 3-rotor machine, with the <b>fourth</b> rotor <b>wheel</b> to be a reflector wheel. Indeed, because of operator errors, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.|$|R

50|$|The VL1 (Series 100) used {{dichroic}} filter, mounted onto three wheels {{with seven}} filters each, plus an open position. A <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> was fitted with five beam apertures and two gobos. Pan and Tilt used servo motors, and intensity {{was controlled by}} an iris {{at the front of}} the head.|$|E
50|$|More highly jeweled watches add jewels {{to other}} pivots, {{starting}} with the pallet fork, then the escape wheel, <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> third wheel, then finally the center wheel. Jeweling like this to the third wheel adds eight jewels, giving 15 jewels in total. Jeweling to the center wheel adds two more giving 17 jewels in total. Thus, a 17 jewel watch {{is considered to be}} fully jeweled.|$|E

50|$|Within Hut 8 he {{made his}} mark and a major {{contribution}} to breaking the Atlantic and Mediterranean Naval Enigma ‘Shark’ (or Triton), as the expert on short signals. This expertise was particularly significant during the period December 1942 - June 1943 when, during the blackout that followed the introduction by the Germans of the <b>fourth</b> Enigma <b>wheel,</b> short signals became the route back into Shark (see Enigma in 1942). This work was considerably aided by the capturing of the short signal code books from German submarine U-559 by men from HMS Petard.|$|R
50|$|Wheel train: A {{gear train}} that transmits {{the force of}} the power source to the escapement. Large gears known as wheels mesh with small gears known as pinions. The wheels in a typical going train are the centre wheel, third wheel, and <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> A {{separate}} set of wheels, the motion work, divides the motion of the minute hand by 12 to move the hour hand and in watches another set, the keyless work, allows the hands to be set.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 Zenith {{introduced}} a watch with a redesigned gear train where the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was at the}} center of the movement, and so could drive a center seconds hand directly. The minute wheel, which had previously been at the center of the movement, was moved off center and drove the minute wheel indirectly. Any fluttering due the indirect gearing is concealed by the relatively slow movement of the minute hand. This redesign brought all the train gearing between the plates and allowed a thinner movement.|$|E

5000|$|The T27 Armored Car was a {{prototype}} armored car {{developed for the}} US Army in 1944 by the Studebaker Corporation. The T27 was an eight-wheeled vehicle, with the first, second and <b>fourth</b> pairs of <b>wheels</b> being powered. With a crew of four, the T27 was armed with two [...]30 caliber machine guns and a 37 mm cannon. Powered by a Cadillac gasoline eight-cylinder engine, two T27's were produced in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|The band issued {{their third}} album, Chrome in June 1992, {{which was also}} {{produced}} by Shirley. The album provided two singles, [...] "Saigon Rose" [...] (February 1992) and [...] "French Revolution" [...] (June). McFarlane noted that both albums with Mushroom [...] "maintained the revved-up, trashy rock'n'roll tradition". However, Mushroom dropped the group in 1993. German label, Normal, issued their <b>fourth</b> album, Medicine <b>Wheel</b> in Europe, while Mushroom Distribution Services (MDS) distributed it in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Then they {{considered}} burlesque. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called [...] "wheels") supplied {{a new show}} every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the Columbia Wheel, the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was [...] "clean"; a <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed {{to be the next}} Florenz Ziegfeld.|$|E
50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the detent escapement retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one escape wheel driven by the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second escape wheel. A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each escape wheel in turn on a coaxial set of locking teeth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Great Wheel {{was also}} {{designed}} by Hewes. The {{challenge was to}} increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to {{below the level of}} the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant's Castle. This gave a head of 32 ft acting on the 32 ft diameter suspension wheel- which is 21 ft wide. The Great Wheel operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904.|$|E
30|$|First, {{the initial}} surface topographies {{seemed to have}} a {{significant}} effect on the friction coefficient independently of the speed. Second, the increase of the sliding velocity would decrease the friction coefficient. Third, especially when accompanied with a high sliding velocity, an initial rough surface would {{have a significant effect on}} the wear of the <b>wheel.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> the highest wear values were observed at groove orientations of 45 ° when accompanied with a high sliding velocity. Finally, the break-in duration seemed to depend on the initial surface topographies of the rail and the sliding velocity.|$|R
5000|$|On February 22, 1922, Swint was {{appointed}} Auxiliary Bishop of Wheeling and Titular Bishop of Sura by Pope Pius XI.

He received his episcopal consecration on May 11, 1922 from Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley, with Bishops Denis J. O'Connell and Hugh Charles Boyle serving as co-consecrators, at St. Joseph's Cathedral. Following the death of Bishop Patrick James Donahue, Swint was named the <b>fourth</b> Bishop of <b>Wheeling</b> on December 11, 1922.

2500|$|The 9F was {{designed}} at both Derby and Brighton Works in 1951 to operate freight trains {{of up to}} 900tons (914tonnes) at 35mph (56km/h) with maximum fuel efficiency. The original proposal was for a boiler from the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia 4-6-2, adapting it to a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement [...] but Riddles eventually settled upon a 2-10-0 type {{because it had been}} used successfully on some of his previous Austerity locomotives. Distributing the adhesive weight over five axles gave a maximum axle load of only 15tons, 10cwt. The driving wheels were [...] in diameter. However, in order to clear the rear coupled wheels the grate had to be set higher, thus reducing firebox volume. There were many problems associated with locomotives of such a long wheelbase, but these were solved by the design team through a series of compromises. The centre driving wheels had no flanges, and those on the second and <b>fourth</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> were reduced in depth. This enabled the locomotive to round curves of only [...] radius. As on all other BR standard steam locomotives the leading wheels were [...] in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also {{drives the}} escape {{wheel of the}} lever escapement. The escape wheel teeth {{alternately}} catch on two fingers called pallets on {{the arms of the}} pallet lever, which rocks back and forth. The other end of the lever has a fork which engages with an upright impulse pin on the balance wheel shaft. Each time the balance wheel swings through its center position, it unlocks the lever, which releases one tooth of the escape wheel, allowing the watch's wheels to advance by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward. As the escape wheel turns, its tooth pushes against the lever, which gives the balance wheel a brief push, keeping it swinging back and forth.|$|E
5000|$|Reliant {{also made}} a small 3-wheeled {{commercial}} vehicle called the Reliant TW9, later sold by other companies as the Ant (and, like the Robin, licence-built in Greece by MEBEA [...] ), which was a chassis and cab, onto which a custom rear body was fitted to create any type of commercial vehicle, a road sweeper, a flat back, a van, a milk float and hydraulic lifting rear bed version were common fitments. Also as a fifth wheel (actually <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel)</b> articulated tractor unit was created to pull large trailers. It was often used by public utility companies or more commonly sold to councils, where its ability to negotiate narrow alleyways was a big advantage.|$|E
50|$|By 1833, Deanston was {{powered by}} four large water wheels - {{the first two}} small wheels were reconstructions of the {{original}} Adelphi Mill wheels and the third wheel was called Samson. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> (named Hercules) measured 36 ft 6in in diameter, was of 300 horse power, and was the largest waterwheel in Europe and the second largest in the world. Original footage of these colossal wheels in operation was recently unearthed and can now be viewed at the distillery. The wheels were dismantled in 1949 and replaced by a more efficient hydro-turbine and steam electricity generating plant, which currently provides enough energy {{for all of the}} distillery's requirements, as well as producing a surplus which is sold back to the National Grid.|$|E
40|$|NASA's {{long-lived}} Cassini-Huygens spacecraft {{is currently}} in its 14 th year of flight {{and in the midst}} of its second, and final, extended mission. Cassini is a massive interplanetary spacecraft that is three axis stabilized and can maintain attitude control using either its reaction control system thrusters or using reaction wheel control. Cassini has four identical reaction wheels, of which three are mutually orthogonal and have a fixed orientation. The <b>fourth</b> reaction <b>wheel</b> has an articulation motor that allows this reaction wheel to be aligned with the momentum direction of any of the other three fixed reaction wheels. The articulation motor allows this reaction wheel to be used as a replacement for any of the other three wheels without any performance degradation. However, due to limitations in the design of this backup system, there are few telemetric indications of the orientation of this reaction wheel following an articulation. This investigation serves to outline the procedures that have been developed by the Cassini Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem to calibrate the position of the articulated reaction wheel assembly in the event that the momentum direction of this reaction wheel must be reoriented...|$|R

50|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment (known as the 1st Virginia at the time) was organized at Wheeling, Virginia, in May, 1861 from volunteer companies from Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, and Marshall counties (the Northern Panhandle of the state). These companies had been formed by pro-Union citizens of these counties in April 1861, after the Commonwealth of Virginia voted to secede from the Union, in order to resist Confederate incursions from the eastern portions of the state. The Regiment was mustered into United States service by companies {{for a period of}} three months (the first company, Company A, was mustered into service on May 10, while the final company, Company K, was mustered on May 23). Company A (from the <b>Fourth</b> Ward of <b>Wheeling)</b> had actually been organized, as the Rough and Ready Guards, on April 18, 1861, the day after the state convention voted for secession.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in {{collaboration}} with the Swiss watch industry standards organization NIHS: Normes de l'Industrie Horlogère Suisse published a standard, ISO 1112, which prohibited manufacturers from including such nonfunctional jewels in the jewel counts in advertising and sales literature. This put a stop to the use of totally nonfunctional jewels. However, some experts say manufacturers have continued to inflate the jewel count of their watches by 'upjeweling'; adding functional jeweled bearings to wheels that do not really need them, exploiting loopholes in ISO 1112. Examples given include adding capstones to third and <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> bearings, jeweling minute wheel bearings, and automatic winding ratchet pawls. Arguably none of these additions adds to the accuracy or longevity of the watch.|$|E
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the cannon pinion, which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|E
50|$|On Sunday Morning Prost's Ferrari had {{a rather}} {{dramatic}} blowup in the warmup, and the Frenchman had to start the race in the spare car. The start was very eventful with Patrese getting away well and with Mansell aggressively chopping {{across the front of}} Senna. Unimpressed, he tried to retake Mansell going into the first turn but Nigel held his line and then proceeded to sweep underneath Berger to grab second at the second corner. After lap 1 the order was Patrese, Mansell, Berger, Senna, and Alesi. Mansell seemed content to shadow Patrese until lap 18 when he slipstreamed past his teammate on the main straight and proceeded to pull away. Things were looking well for Williams until Mansell came in for his stop on lap 29 and things went horribly wrong. The right rear tyre men got confused and one mechanic raised his hand when the other had not gotten the wheel perfectly on. Mansell set off down the pitlane but his tyre did not want to comply, the tyre fell off and the frustrated Englishman was left stranded {{in the middle of the}} pit lane with three wheels. The team ran out and put a <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the car, breaking many rules in the process.|$|E

Between 1955 and 1957, 77 vehicles were built with minor differences between production lots (different commander's cupola etc.). The SU-122-54 had a modified chassis, with small spaces between the first, second and <b>fourth</b> pair of <b>wheels</b> and a large gap between the third, similar to the T-62's and a superstructure, built into the hull, housing the 122mm D-49 L/48.4 gun for which the vehicle carries 35 rounds. The secondary armament consisted of two KPVT heavy machine guns, one mounted as an anti-aircraft machine gun near the commander's hatch and the other mounted coaxially with the main gun. The vehicle carried 600 rounds for the machine guns. The main gun has a fume extractor positioned right behind the muzzle brake, some vehicles {{did not have the}} fume extractor. Other variations included a different commander's cupola.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} to evaluate the isometric wheel turning strength of 12 male and 12 female subjects using four different wheel designs. Three of the wheels investigated were new designs developed specifically for this study, while the <b>fourth</b> was a <b>wheel</b> currently used on many railroad car hand brakes. The three new designs considered were a cylindrical tube (4. 3 cm in diameter), a cylindrical tube (2. 5 cm in diameter) with spheres mounted along the edge, and a circular zig-zag design. Strength data were collected using a mock-up of the ladder and platform arrangement found on most railroad hopper and box cars. The task simulated the final tightening exertion required to secure railroad car hand brakes. Strength capabilities were measured using two methods: 1) a three second average during a six-second trial; 2) the peak reached on a separate trial in which subjects did not sustain an exertion. Results showed that the torque generated by the subjects was highest for the zig-zag design, followed in order by the wheel with the spheres, the cylindrical wheel, and the standard wheel; average torque values were 19...|$|R
