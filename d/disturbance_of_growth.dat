40|$|FIVE-FLUOROURACIL (5 FU) is {{a member}} of a series of {{fluorinated}} pyrimidines first synthesized in 1957 separately by Heidelberger of the University of Wisconsin and by Duschinsky and Pleven of Hoffmann-LaRoche. Since then it has been subjected to extensive studies, experimental as well as clinical, as an anti-neoplastic agent. It is believed to exert its effect through an irreversible inhibition of the enzyme, thymidylate synthetase, thus blocking the methylation reaction of deoxyuridilic acid to thymidylic acid. This in turn interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and produces a <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> leading eventually to the death of the cell.

30|$|The trochlear {{epiphysis}} ossification centre appears after 5  years of age {{and develops}} between 8 and 13  years of age in boys. The ossification centre fuses with the metaphysis of the humerus between 13 and 16  years of age [6, 27]. The trochlear blood supply comes from two end arterioles. The lateral aspect of the medial crista, the trochlear groove and the trochlear apex are relatively hypovascular. So those structures are prone to disturbances in the blood supply {{and the development of}} avascular necrosis [4]. Trochlear avascular necrosis is characterised by <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> involving the centres of ossification of the trochlea. Therefore, fishtail deformity could be a result of avascular necrosis of the vessels supplying the lateral trochlea [4, 28]. If the lateral trochlear ossification centre development is disturbed and the remaining normal physis continues to grow, the distal humerus assumes a typical V shape: the fishtail [4, 21].|$|E

In this study, we used the chick as a model to investigate the role of Ror 2 in skeletogenesis and to elucidate the functional consequences of Ror 2 mutations. For this purpose, we cloned chicken Ror 2 and analyzed its expression pattern at various embryonic stages by in situ hybridization and immunolabeling. We document expression of cRor 2 in several organs, including mesonephros, heart, nervous system, intestine and cartilage. The high conservation of expression {{when compared with the}} mouse underlines the validity of the chick as a model system. Using replication-competent retroviral vector–mediated overexpression, we analyzed the functional consequences of truncating BDB and RS mutations in the developing chick limb.

Because selenium enrichment may influence the nutrient balance of plants, a study was done to test the effects of selenite-Se (Na 2 SeO 3 ⋅ 5 H 2 O) on selected macronutrients content in maize (Zea mays L. var. saccharata Kcke. cv. Zota Karowa) seedlings. Plants were grown in Hoagland I nutrient solution (pH 6, 2) amended with selenite at 0 (control), 5, 25, 50 and 100 µmol⋅dm- 3 for 14 days. The dry weight of the shoots was then analyzed for phosphorus (P), potas-sium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content. Phosphorus and calcium content increased, while potassium content decreased with increasing selenium treatments. No si-gnificant differences were found for magnesium level. Plant growth was affected by exces-sive selenium concentration. At low concentration (5 µmol⋅dm- 3), selenium tended to sti-mulate the plant growth and the root elongation but at higher concentrations (50 and 100 µmol⋅dm- 3) the dry mass accumulation and root tolerance index severely decreased. The study revealed that <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> and reduction <b>of</b> plant’s biomass at the presence of high selenium concentrations in the nutrient solution may have resulted from the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> mineral balance of plants, namely accumulation of large amounts of calcium and phosphorus in shoot tissues...|$|R
40|$|Congenital defects of the femur {{vary from}} simple {{hypoplasia}} {{of the bone}} to complete absence. Classification of these defects has been suggested by Nilsonne (1928) and by Mouchet and Ibos (1928), but neither has met with general acceptance. In more recent years Golding (1939, 1948) has demon-strated the close association of the short femur with congenital coxa vara, and has emphasized that these are variations of the same underlying abnor-mality. The clinical distinction between {{the various types of}} femoral defect is important as a guide to the prognosis of limb development. From an examination of patients with congenital abnormalities of the femur the following classifica-tion is suggested: 1. Simple femoral hypoplasia. 2. Congenital coxa vara. 3. Femoral hypoplasia with coxa vara. 4. Pseudarthrosis of the femur. 5. Hypoplasia of the lower femoral epiphysis. 6. Complete absence of the femur. Although these patients commonly have other skeletal defects, the major congenital abnormalities affecting the nervous system, or in the chest and abdomen, appear to be rare. Their span of life is thus rarely affected, and detailed autopsy or pathological examination of the limb is rarely possible. From the clinical examination of these patients, however, and from serial radiographs, much information can be obtained about the clinical course of the limb abnormality, {{and the nature of the}} underlying <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Study Design and Aims This was an {{observational}} {{pilot study}} of the vertebral body growth plates in scoliosis involving high-resolution coronal plane magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histological examination. One {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether vertebral body growth plates in scoliosis demonstrated abnormalities on MR imaging. A second aim was to determine if a relationship existed between MR and histological abnormalities in these vertebral body growth plates. Methods MR imaging sequences of 18 patients demonstrated the vertebral body growth plates well enough to detect gross abnormalities/deficient areas/zones. Histological examination of ten vertebral body growth plates removed during routine scoliosis surgery was performed. Observational histological comparison with MR images was possible in four cases. Results Four of the 18 MR images demonstrated spines with normal curvature and normal vertebral body growth plates. In 13 scoliotic spines, convex and concave side growth plate deficiencies were observed most frequently at or near the apex of the curve. One MR image demonstrated a 55 ° kyphosis and no convex or concave side deficiencies. The degree of vertebral body wedging was independent of the presence of vertebral body growth plate deficiency. Histological abnormalities of the vertebral body growth plates were demonstrated in four with MR imaging abnormalities. Conclusion This study demonstrated MR image abnormalities of scoliotic vertebral body growth plates compared to controls. A qualitative relationship was demonstrated between MR imaging and histological abnormalities. The finding that vertebral body growth plate deficiencies occurred both on the convex and concave sides of the spine, closest to the apical vertebra of the scoliosis curve, implied that they are less likely to be the result of adaptive changes to the physical forces involved in the scoliotic deformity. One explanation is that they represent a primary <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{can cause}} severe <b>growth</b> <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> the craniomandibular system. Antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) of the rabbit TMJ is simulating the inflammatory {{process of the}} TMJ in JIA. In the first two studies of the present thesis {{the effect of a}} systemic administration of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonist etanercept and methotrexate (MTX) on AIA in young rabbits should be investigated by means of three different histological staining methods. The aim of the third study was to investigate the development of the mandible in growing rabbits which were suffering from bilateral arthritis of the TMJ. In addition, the therapeutic effect of the TNF-α antagonist etanercept should be investigated. Material and Methods: In all three studies, 18 female New Zealand white rabbits aged 10 weeks were used. In all studies, a sensitization on ovalbumin (OA) was performed in 12 animals and followed by the induction of a bilateral arthritis of the TMJ by intra-articular injections of OA. In the first and the third study the intra-articular injections were repeated every three weeks with the purpose to maintain the inflammation. In the first and the third study 6 of the 12 rabbits received weekly subcutaneous injections of etanercept, in the second study, an intramuscular injection of MTX. In all studies the other 6 animals remained without therapy. Another 6 animals served as controls, receiving no treatment or intra-articular injection at all. In the first two studies after euthanasia at the age of 22 weeks, all TMJs were retrieved en bloc. Sagittal sections were cut and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin (H-E) and Safranin-O for the evaluation of the Mankin score, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). In the third study all animals received computed tomographies (CT) of the maxillofacial region every three weeks, beginning from week 10 through week 22 {{until the end of the}} study. Following segmentation, the development of the mandible was analyzed by volumetry. Results: In the arthritis groups of both studies, a chronic inflammation with degeneration of the articular cartilage, which was more pronounced in the first study than in the second study, could be observed. In both studies, the signs of cartilage degeneration were significantly reduced in both treatment groups (etanercept and MTX) but still present. In contrast, the joints in the control groups were inconspicuous. The correlation between the Mankin score and the number of TRAP-positive cells was more pronounced in the first study than in the second. The mandibular development was not continuous but growth decreased from week 10 to week 22. In all groups the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> was seen between the weeks 10 and 13. Arthritis caused severe <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> especially in the condylar process. In the etanercept group a better, but not a totally normal mandibular development compared to the control group could be observed. Conclusions: AIA causes severe damage in the TMJ of young rabbits and <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> An improvement seems to be achievable by a systemic administration of etanercept or MTX. Under therapy with etanercept an improved but not completely normal growth could be achieved...|$|R

Major complications occurred in 21 (46 %) neonates, included apnea / bradycardia 46 % (21 / 46), hypotension 26 % (12 / 46), seizures 2 % (1 / 46), pulmonary hemorrhage 2 % (1 / 46), and necrotizing enterocolitis 2 % (1 / 46). Minor complications occurred in 35 neonates, including hyperthermia 76 % (35 / 46), diarrhea / feeding intolerance 25 % (11 / 46), and digital edema / flushing 32 % (15 / 46). A significant and un-common late complication of PGE treatment is the development of cortical hyperostosis of the long bones. Twenty patients received prolonged PGE therapy (more than 28 days). The radiography of five of these pa-tients showed cortical hyperostosis of the long bones. However, the cortical hyperostosis seemed more de-pendent on the duration of administration of PGE than on the dosage of PGE administered.

These results showed that in the light stage the stem circumnutation was downregulated more strongly than the growth. Short-term stem responses to darkening and illumination were a further display of the relation between growth and circumnutations. Switching off the light caused an increase in the growth and circumnutation rate. In some cases it was accompanied by changes in the rotation direction. On the other hand, switching the light on caused an immediate transient (several-minute long) decrease in the growth rate resulting in stem contraction, and this was accompanied by an almost complete pause of circumnutation.

In addition, the mortality of pediatric patients on chronic dialysis therapy is 4 - to 5 -fold higher than that after successful renal transplantation.

In an intense discussion during the last three years in the Eurotransplant Kidney Advisory Committee (ETKAC) and in the Commission for Organ Transplantation of the German Board of Physicians important improvements of the allocation rules for pediatric patients could be achieved. These revisions of the allocation rules, which have become effective on December 8, 2010, are a significant improvement for pediatric patients, because (i) also adolescent patients above 16 years of age with still existing growth potential will be granted the pediatric bonus, (ii) the waiting time for all pediatric patients will be shortened by additional pediatric bonus points, (iii) kidney transplants from donors below the age of 16 years will be preferably allocated to pediatric recipients. Furthermore, one should continue to aim for a good HLA match, not only to achieve optimal graft survival, but also to avoid anti-HLA sensitization for a 2 nd or 3 rd transplant, which is likely to be required in young patients during their lifetime, and to reduce the complication of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease...|$|R

All had received standard anti-tuberculosis drug treatment. Fifteen were treated conservatively alone, while the other 15 had a debridement type of surgery in addition to drugs. At review, one-third had occasional mild pain, but this was only present in the conservatively treated group. Stiffness, however, was more predominant in the operated and in the late onset groups. Some mild deformity was seen in 17 out of 30 patients and was related not so much to <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> epiphyseal <b>growth,</b> but rather, to bone collapse. Interesting X-ray appearances at follow-up were found. The factors which could lead to a good outcome included young age of onset, treatment within six months of onset, and early mobilization. If the disease is well advanced, surgical treatment will lead to a painless joint, but with greater restriction of joint movement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Deviations in the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the mandibular condyle {{can affect}} both the {{functional}} occlusion and the aesthetic {{appearance of the}} face. The reasons for these growth deviations are numerous and often entail complex sequences of malfunction at the cellular level. The aim of this review is to summarize recent progress {{in the understanding of}} pathological alterations occurring during childhood and adolescence that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and, hence, result in disorders <b>of</b> mandibular <b>growth.</b> Pathological conditions taken into account are subdivided into (1) congenital malformations with associated growth disorders, (2) primary growth disorders, and (3) acquired diseases or trauma with associated growth disorders. Among the congenital malformations, hemifacial microsomia (HFM) appears to be the principal syndrome entailing severe growth disturbances, whereas growth abnormalities occurring in conjunction with other craniofacial dysplasias seem far less prominent than could be anticipated based on their often disfiguring nature. Hemimandibular hyperplasia and elongation undoubtedly constitute the most obscure conditions that are associated with prominent, often unilateral, abnormalities of condylar, and mandibular <b>growth.</b> Finally, <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> mandibular <b>growth</b> as a result of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and condylar fractures seem to be direct consequences of inflammatory and/or mechanical damage to the condylar cartilage...|$|R
40|$|The baby-machine system, which {{produces}} new-born Escherichia coli cells from cultures immobilized on a membrane, was developed {{many years ago}} {{in an attempt to}} attain optimal synchrony with minimal <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> steady-state <b>growth.</b> In the present article, we put forward a model to describe the behaviour of cells produced by this method, and provide quantitative evaluation of the parameters involved, at each <b>of</b> four different <b>growth</b> rates. Considering the high level of selection achievable with this technique and the natural dispersion in interdivision times, we believe that the output of the baby machine is probably close to optimal in terms of both quality and persistence of synchrony. We show that considerable information on events in the cell cycle can be obtained from populations with age distributions very much broader than those achieved with the baby machine and differing only modestly from steady state. The data presented here, together with the long and fruitful history of findings employing the baby-machine technique, suggest that minimisation of stress on cells {{is the single most important}} factor for successful cell-cycle analysis...|$|R
40|$|An unusual form {{of chronic}} {{osteomyelitis}} in children is described. Three children presented with clinical signs of acute infection and radiographs revealed a pre-existing destructive bone lesion. Exploration of the lesions did not release pus, and cultures for pathogens were negative. The lesions healed but the symptoms returned intermittently {{over many years}} with the development <b>of</b> sclerosis and <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> bone <b>growth.</b> The lesions {{did not respond to}} antibiotics or operative treatment. All the patients were fully investigated and although the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased the white blood count was seldom abnormal. There were no neurological abnormalities. Two of the three cases required an osteotomy to correct malalignment. A comparison is made between the findings in these three patients with similar cases reported recently and possible causes are discussed. Three examples of a rare, chronic osteomyelitis in children are described. This term usually implies either a bone abscess with sclerotic walls-a Brodie’s abscess-or an infection with sequestration, the formation of an involucrum and often with sinuses. In both these forms an infective pathogen, usually Staphylococcus aureus, i...|$|R
40|$|Abnormalities in the {{integral}} components of bone, including bone matrix, bone mineral and bone cells, {{give rise to}} complex <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> skeletal development, <b>growth</b> and homeostasis. Non-specific drug delivery using high-dose systemic administration may decrease therapeutic efficacy of drugs and {{increase the risk of}} toxic effects in non-skeletal tissues, which remain clinical challenges in the treatment of skeletal disorders. Thus, targeted delivery systems are urgently needed to achieve higher drug delivery efficiency, improve therapeutic efficacy in the targeted cells/tissues, and minimize toxicities in non-targeted cells/tissues. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the application of different targeting moieties and nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery in skeletal disorders, and also discuss the advantages, challenges and perspectives in their clinical translation...|$|R
40|$|Literature on monsoon {{formation}} is surveyed. Monsoon depressions over the Bay of Bengal are caused either by amplification of westward propagating weak disturbances or by downward propagation {{of the internal}} jet instability of the easterly jet. Barotropic instability of low level flow helps the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> weak <b>disturbances.</b> Rapid <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> an already existing weak perturbation is due to CISK. If the disturbance attains adequate amplitude in the lower levels (either by downward propagation of wave energy of by CISK), the low level moisture convergence and latent heat of condensation are utilized more efficiently {{for the development of}} a vertically coupled deep disturbance, which along with upper level easterlies contributes to the westward propagation <b>of</b> the <b>disturbance.</b> Absence <b>of</b> strong vertical coupling leads to vertical tilt and decay <b>of</b> the <b>disturbance...</b>|$|R
