40|$|Sand {{jets and}} {{particle}} clouds {{are common in}} many engineering areas such as marine bed capping, dredging, and artificial island construction. Because of {{the wide range of}} their application, a better understanding of particle cloud?s behavior will lead to increase the efficiency of engineering systems and lead to an improvement in predicting the behavior of solid-liquid flows. There are many parameters that can control the behavior of particle clouds behavior such as nozzle diameter do, particle size D 50, released mass m, impact velocity of sand particles (at the surface) ui and initial oblique angle of the particle cloud. Moreover, some characteristics of two-phase flows such as entrainment coefficient and drag coefficient can be very important for controlling the impact of the two-phase flow. In this research, laboratory experiments were conducted to find the impact of controlling parameters on the dynamics of vertical and oblique particle clouds in the water media. For considering the impact velocity of sand particles on the surface, the ui was varied by changing the release height H. Nozzle size and mass of particles were grouped to form a non-dimensional parameter as aspect ratio Lo/do, where Lo is a length of sand particles occupied in a pipe with a nozzle diameter of do. It was found that the modified initial energy and circulation are correlated with Lo/do. A direct correlation between the width and <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> of particle clouds with Lo/do was found. These relationships were formulated power law equations and can be used for prediction of cloud size and its <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity.</b> A wide range of particle sizes (D 50 = 0. 1375 mm? 0. 718 mm) was used to study the effects of particle size on spreading of sand jets and particle clouds. Effects of Lo/do and particle size on the evolution of sand particles in water media was also investigated.

To this end, laboratory experiments were performed on density currents having various initial conditions and bottom slopes. Then, vertical velocity profiles were recorded in the body of density currents. The velocity structure of the currents was investigated by fitting equations to the wall and jet regions of the measured profiles, and the constants of the equations were yielded with R 2 more than 0. 80.

40|$|Lava flows can be {{considered}} as hot viscous cores within thinner, solidified crusts. Interaction between crust and core determines a flow's morphological and dynamical evolution. When the lava core dominates, flow advance approaches a steady state. When crusts are the limiting factor, advance is more irregular. These two conditions can be distinguished by a timescale ratio comparing rates of core deformation and crustal formation. Aa and budding pahoehoe lavas are used as examples of core- and crustal-dominated flows, respectively. A simple model describes the transition between pahoehoe and aa flow in terms of lava discharge rate, underlying slope, and either the thickness or velocity of the flow front.

Heat exchangers for air conditioning applications are often of the fin and tube type. By choosing special fin geometries, the thermal performance of the heat exchanger can be enhanced. One of the recently proposed fin geometries for round tubes is the combination of louvers with a delta winglet vortex generator (VG). Several parameters impact the performance of this design, such as the louver angle and the angle of attack of the vortex generator. The fin geometry can be optimized by performing numerical simulations for different values of these parameters. In this work steady state computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed for a fixed inlet <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity.</b> Many authors use design of experiments techniques to evaluate the performance {{with a small amount}} of simulations. However, this often results in the assumption that many interaction effects between the parameters are negligible. In this work, a full factorial analysis has been done which is able to resolve all interactions between all parameters. It is shown that there are important interactions between the height of the VG, the aspect ratio of the VG and the louver angle. Taking these interactions into account, the optimal values of the parameters are determined with the objective of maximizing the heat transfer coefficient. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|Algorithmic {{variations}} to {{the glacier}} motion estimation from differential SAR interferometry {{are discussed in}} the present paper. Two efficient albeit relatively simple algorithms for modelling glacier dynamics using spaceborne INSAR data have been devised and tested as alternatives to the conventional DINSAR approach. Neither of the algorithms involves the procedure of interferometric phase unwrapping, thus excluding the areal error propagation and improving the modelling accuracy. In general, they remain feasible even under significant phase noise. An original gradient approach (GINSAR) to differential processing of repeat-pass SAR interferograms based on the calculation of interferometric phase gradients, the generation of glacier slope maps and the analysis of differences between multitemporal slope maps provides global and fast solutions to unsupervised glacier change detection and ice motion estimation. A transferential approach is based on the interferometric measurement of the fast-ice translation forced by the glacier flow and provides good reference values on the glacier <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> and velocity gradients for the GINSAR technique.

Understanding the dynamic interactions of the sand particles and its ambient are important for proper design and optimizing the engineering systems. Mass, momentum and energy of the system can be influenced by interactions of the suspended particles within the jet. The conducted experimental studies and numerical and nominal modeling in this thesis are new in terms of the fundamental understanding of jet characteristics. Part of this thesis focused on the experimental parameters and characteristics of oily sand jets such as frontal width and velocity. Effects of the controlling parameters of the oily sand jets such as nozzle diameter, oil layer thickness and mass were investigated and {{it was found that the}} effect of nozzle diameter on evolution of oily sand jets was more significant than the other parameters. Study in water phase, it was observed that the bursting of a group of particles covered with a thin oil layer can be classified into three different forms. Evolution of trailing waves of the oily sand jets and their characteristics such as wave length and wave amplitude were also investigated. Part of this thesis focused on Data mining and boundary visualization techniques to study the effects of experimental parameters on the shapes of oily sand jets. Model trees were developed to classify and predict the growth of oily sand jets at different conditions. It was found that the model tree can predict the growth of sand jets with an uncertainty of ? 8. 2 %, ? 6. 8 % and ? 8. 7 % for width, velocity and distance from the nozzle, respectively. The main aim of this thesis is to explore and find correlations between the dynamics of sand particles through passing oil-water interface and controlling parameters such as nozzle diameter, oil layer thickness and mass of sand particles. Therefore, it was found that the nozzle size has significant effect on characteristics of evolution of oily sand jets such as <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity,</b> development of bursting, formation of trailing wave section and shear stress in comparison with other controlling parameters such as oil layer thickness and mass of sand particles.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out on {{initially}} gas-aerated and gas-fluidized granular flows propagating into a horizontal channel. After lateral acceleration following release of the originally fluidized bed, two contrasting flow behaviors were observed, which reflected the degree of initial fluidization and the grain size. Initial fluidization disrupts the interparticle contact network, which controls internal friction of the static bed. The flow regime then depends on the timescale needed to reestablish a strong contact network, and this time increases as the grain size decreases. Initially aerated and fluidized flows of coarse particles (>approximate to 100 mum) and initially aerated flows of fine particles (<&AP; 100 μm) behave as their nonfluidized counterparts and they propagate as a wedge, with decelerating velocities so that the front position increases as the &SIM; 0. 8 power of time. In contrast, initially fluidized flows of fine particles propagate for most of their duration at constant thickness and <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> in a similar fashion to the slumping regime of buoyancy-driven gravity currents of Newtonian fluids. We have determined a Froude number Fr for such flows of &AP; 2. 6 consistent with published data from experimental and theoretical investigations on inviscid fluids.

Aircraft data from the New England Winter Storms Experiment (NEWSEX) are used to examine the vertical structure of four New England coastal fronts. The aircraft made multiple passes at varying elevations through the coastal fronts. The observations were projected onto cross sections normal to the coastal fronts using frontal orientations determined from surface analyses and <b>frontal</b> <b>velocities</b> determined from a least-squares fit to multiple frontal penetrations. The frontal zones were found to be roughly 200 m wide, rising sharply from the ground to a height of 150 m to 400 m over distances of 0. 5 to 2. 5 km before leveling off and rising gradually toward the mountains. The underlying pools of cold air were similar in form and flow patterns to cold-air damming structures observed elsewhere along the East Coast. The coastal fronts formed the leading edges of the cold pools. Air on the warm side of the fronts was neutrally stratified, having been recently heated by the warm Gulf of Maine. This warm air attained vertical velocities of up to 2. 5 m s? 1 as it rose over the coastal fronts and accelerated toward the mountains, and evidence is found for direct precipitation enhancements by this updraft. The coastal fronts possessed characteristics of atmospheric density currents, with a low-level inflow within the cold air toward the head and turbulent mixing behind the head. Because the fronts were quasi-stationary and were located in neutrally stratified environments, a direct comparison is made with theoretical predictions of inviscid density current behavior.

Our analyses are mainly performed with offset-tracking of ALOS- 1 PALSAR- 1 (2007 – 2011) and Sentinel- 1 (2015 – 2017) data. In certain cases JERS- 1 SAR (1994 – 1998), TerraSAR-X (2008 – 2012), Radarsat- 2 (2009 – 2016) and ALOS- 2 PALSAR- 2 (2015 – 2016) data were used to fill-in spatial or temporal gaps. Validation of the latest Sentinel- 1 results was accomplished by means of SAR data at higher spatial resolution (Radarsat- 2 Wide Ultra Fine) and ground-based measurements. In general, we observe a deceleration of flow velocities for the major tidewater glaciers in the Canadian Arctic and an increase in <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> along with a retreat of frontal positions over Svalbard and the Russian Arctic. However, all regions have strong accelerations for selected glaciers. The latter developments can be well traced based on the very high temporal sampling of Sentinel- 1 acquisitions since 2015, revealing new insights in glacier dynamics. For example, surges on Spitsbergen (e. g., Negribreen, Nathorsbreen, Penckbreen and Strongbreen) have a different characteristic and timing than those over Eastern Austfonna and Edgeoya (e. g., Basin 3, Basin 2 and Stonebreen). Events similar to those ongoing on Eastern Austofonna were also observed over the Vavilov Ice Cap on Severnaya Zemlya and possibly Simony Glacier on Franz-Josef Land.

Ontake by the Western Nagano Prefecture Earthquake in Sept. 14, 1984. It was instantly transformed into a huge debris avalanche and ran down about 12 km,with a mean <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> of 20 - 26 m/sec, filling the valley and partly overflowing at someplaces. We divided the whole affected area of the debris avalanche into the seven kinds of differentzones through the evaluation of ten depositional factors according to the aerophotographic analy-sis. Among the ten factors, the presence and the properties of stripe, wrinkle and drift-woodon {{the surface of the}} deposits were most significant for the estimation of the motion and the mate-rial composition of the debris avalanche. Analysis of the debris materials which were sampledfrom the debris-avalanche deposits told us firstly that the minerals of the debris avalanche werecomposed of a large portion of feldspar, of a very small portion of quartz, and of no clay minerals,and secondly that the debris matrix of the dry type deposits did not contain wooden pieces andthe median particle size of the wet type deposits was smaller than that of the dry deposits. Then we infered a structure model consisting of four layers for this debris avalanche fromthe synthetic study on the distribution of deposits zones, the depositional sequences of these zones,and the granumetric and the mineralogical compositions of the debris matrix. In this model,the top layer and the medium layer are supported by the bottom layer of the wet debris flow. The top and medium layers are the dry and the semi-wet clastic debris mixtures respectively,and they contain many dry blocks. The main part of the debris avalanche composed of theabove three layers is followed by the debris flows with large water content...|$|E
40|$|AIR+SPI:SPE:CGU:FSIInternational audienceThe {{survival}} of an experimental bioaerosol in photocatalytic and non-photocatalytic filters was investigated under UV-A or UV-C radiation exposure. To ensure {{the generation of}} reproducible bioaerosols in real operating conditions of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and their homogeneous coating on filters, a reactor with an optimal geometry was developed. The bacterial aerosol was generated from standardised bacterial suspensions and the Gram-negative bacterial model Escherichia coli {{was used as the}} experimental organism. The bioaerosol was characterised in terms of particle size distribution, reproducibility and stability over time. The coating of aerosolised cells on the filters was then studied. The total number of aerosolised E. coli cells was different from the amount of cultivable bacterial cells extracted from filters, probably resulting from the stress of the aerosolisation process. Damages to the outer membrane of E. coli cells were clearly observed through SEM and epifluorescent microscopy analysis. The influence of important physical parameters in the reactor-aerosolisation duration, <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> and relative humidity- on the amount of aerosolised cells coated on filters were also investigated. Finally, the effects of UV-A or UV-C radiation were assessed on aerosolised microorganisms coated on HEPA photocatalytic filters and on photocatalytic or non-photocatalytic filters containing activated charcoal. The HEPA photocatalytic filters demonstrated a better disinfection efficiency with full damages of the aerosolised bacterial cells, probably resulting from an optimal contact between TiO 2 coating and the microorganisms. In contrast, the use of filters with activated charcoal resulted in the apparition of an inactivation threshold that could be attributed to the penetration of aerosolised cells within the activated charcoal layer and the absence of contact with the photocatalyst. However, UV-C photocatalysis was able to inactivate faster and, at the same time, mineralise biological pollutants than UV-A. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The fluidal {{behavior}} of pyroclastic flows is commonly attributed to high gas pore pressures and associated fluidization effects. We carried out experiments on flows of fluidized volcanic ash at 170 degrees C, which is {{hot enough to}} reduce cohesive effects of moisture. The flows were generated in a 3 - m- long, horizontal lock- exchange flume. The ash was fluidized and expanded uniformly in the flume reservoir by up to 43 % above loose packing and was then released. Each flow defluidized progressively down the flume until motion ceased. Initial expansion E and initial height h(0) were varied independently of one another. The flows traveled in a laminar manner. Flow fronts exhibited three main phases of transport: (1) a brief initial phase of gravitational slumping, (2) a dominant, approximately constant velocity phase, and (3) a brief stopping phase. Phase 2 <b>frontal</b> <b>velocities</b> scaled with root gh(0), like other types of dam- break flow. Deposition from initially expanded flows took place by progressive sediment aggradation {{at a rate that}} was independent of distance and varied only with E. Despite rates of shear up to 80 s(- 1), aggradation rates were identical to those determined independently, at the same value of E, in quasi-static collapse tests. Sedimentation caused the flows to thin progressively during transit until they ran out of volume. The dynamics were governed to a first order by two dimensionless parameters: (1) the initial aspect ratio h(0) /x(0) in the lock reservoir and (2) the ratio t(sett) /t(grav) of two timescales: a particle settling time t(sett) and a gravitational acceleration time t(grav) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed {{to perform the}} {{parametric}} analysis on thermo-hydraulic performance of a compact heat exchanger using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The analysis {{has been carried out}} at different <b>frontal</b> air <b>velocities</b> by varying the geometrical parameters such as fin pitch, transverse tube pitch, longitudinal tube pitch, louver pitch and louver angle. The air side performance of the heat exchanger has been evaluated by calculating Colburn factor (j) and Fanning friction factor (f). The comparison of CFD results with the experimental data exhibited a good agreement and the influence of various geometrical parameters for the selected range of values on the pressure drop, heat transfer coefficient and goodness factor was analyzed. The results obtained from the analysis will be very useful to optimize the louvered fin and flat tube compact heat exchanger for better thermo-hydraulic performance analysis without the need of time consuming and expensive experimentation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{laboratory}} experiments on the behaviour of sustained, dense granular flows in a horizontal flume, in which high-gas pore pressure was maintained throughout the flow duration by continuous injection of gas through the flume base. The flows were fed by a sustained (0. 5 - 30 s) supply of fine (75 +/- 15 mu m) particles from a hopper; the falling particles impacted an impingement surface at concentrations of similar to 3 to 45 %, where they densified rapidly to generate horizontally moving, dense granular flows. When the gas supplied through the flume base was below the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles (i. e. aerated flow conditions), three flow phases were identified: (i) an initial dilute spray of particles travelling at 1 - 2 ms- 1, followed by (ii) a dense granular flow travelling at 0. 5 - 1 m s- 1, then by (iii) sustained aggradation of the deposit by a prolonged succession of thin flow pulses. The maximum runout of the phase 2 flow was linearly dependent on the initial mass flux, and the <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> had a square-root dependence on mass flux. The frontal propagation speed during phase 3 had a linear relationship with mass flux. The total mass of particles released had no significant control on either flow velocity or runout {{in any of the}} phases. High-frequency flow unsteadiness during phase 3 generated deposit architectures with progradational and retrogradational packages and multiple internal erosive contacts. When the gas supplied through the flume base was equal to the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles (i. e. fluidized flow conditions), the flows remained within phase 2 for their entire runout, no deposit formed and the particles ran off the end of the flume. Sustained granular flows differ significantly from instantaneous flows generated by lock-exchange mechanisms, in that the sustained flows generate (by prolonged progressive aggradation) deposits that are much thicker than the flowing layer of particles at any given moment. The experiments offer a first attempt to investigate the physics of the sustained pyroclastic flows that generate thick, voluminous ignimbrites...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 844 on 13. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) Small-scale estuarine plume discharges into adjacent seas are common inshore features {{responsible for the}} transportation and dispersion of brackish water in the coastal zone. However, the physics that govern small-scale mixing in the frontal regions of river plumes are still poorly understood. The current study quantified and compared the observed hydrodynamic properties present inside a radially spreading river plume discharge from the River Teign, Teignmouth, Devon, UK, to those predicted by a generic plume model. Numerical simulations designed to replicate time dependent radial plume spreading from a constant source predicted {{the development of an}} internal interfacial bore that lagged the surface plume front through radial distance and time from initial plume release. The model was scaled from time lapse X-band radar imagery that recorded several plume discharge events. Scaled model output predicted the internal bore to form approximately 180 m behind the leading surface front. Subsequent field studies employed instrumentation capable of recording high-resolution measurements of temperature, salinity and velocity, spatially and vertically throughout the plume's buoyant layer over two ebb tidal cycles. Results suggested the plume advanced at a rate dependent on a super-critical interfacial Froude number of 0 (1. 3) and was a region of intense mixing and downward mass entrainment. Temperature contours recorded through the stratified plume gave no indication of an internal bore in its predicted position but did show an abrupt shallowing of the interfacial region some 40 to 60 m behind the surface plimie front. Super-critical interfacial Froude and critical Gradient Richardson numbers present in this region of the plume implied that this was the position of the predicted bore. The form of the bore often appeared as an ensemble of undular internal hydraulic jumps rather than a singular discontinuity as predicted by the model. Bulk mixing analysis inside the leading front based on established gravity current theory suggested that the extent of turbulent exchange in the model frontal boundary condition P, was underestimated by about a factor of 2. With the required increase in p, model simulations showed a decrease in the lag distance of internal bore formation to one where critical Froude numbers were detected inside the actual plume. Throughout both surveys, the gravity head remained a reasonably constant size due to any increase in across <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> over the ebb tidal cycle being matched by an increase in entrainment and mixing. The subsequent conclusions from the study show the outflow and mixing dynamics are controlled by the estuary's tidal modulation of estuarine brackish water outflow / plume inflow rate behind the leading plume frontal discontinuity...|$|E
40|$|Code {{and data}} files {{available}} with hard {{copy of the}} thesis in the library. Lahars and other mass flows are highly hazardous phenomena that can pose great risk to areas in their path. Due to their often unpredictable onsets, scientific observations are limited. In addition, the erosive capabilities of a lahar mean that {{the most commonly used}} monitoring and sampling methods, such as load cells and bedload traps, are often damaged early in the flow. The cost of repair and maintenance of these instrumentation prohibits comprehensive coverage of each channel that might be at risk from lahars. The development of seismic sensors as an alternative monitoring method could prove effective as they do not require contact with a flow and are therefore less at risk from damage. The complex behaviour of a lahar can be witnessed in the geophysical record of its passage which, in combination with more traditional monitoring methods, can be used to record the detailed evolution of a flow. The three-dimensional analysis of seismometer recordings can provide an approximation of the <b>frontal</b> <b>velocity</b> that may differ from maximum velocity estimates made using super-elevation calculations. Comparisons of the seismic records of different mass flow types illustrate {{that it is possible to}} differentiate between them. Frequency analysis allows for the distinction of the flow mechanisms, particle interactions, and dominant rheology of a lahar. Low frequencies are more indicative of bedload frictional motion, while higher frequencies reflect the collisional impacts of particles, either between themselves or with the substrate. Detailed records of a flow at a single site provide a comprehensive understanding of the temporal variations that occur within the duration of a lahar, while comparative analyses of numerous sites along a channel highlight its downstream evolution. While initial onset signals can be recorded at local-to-source sites, they are attenuated too quickly to be observed further downstream. The records at proximal sites can, however, reflect the stages, or packets, involved during the main bulk of lahar initiation. At more distal sites, observations show that a lahar transitions to a [minimal] 4 -phase behaviour. This consists of a frontal bow wave of ambient streamwater that increases in volume with distance from source, and immediately precedes the lahar proper. The following phases are defined by variations in sediment concentration, velocity, stage, and, in the case of Crater Lake-originating lahars, water chemistry. The understanding of the variable behaviour possible during a lahar, as well as the identification of the specific flow type recorded, is fundamental to modelling approximations of flow volumes, sediment concentrations, likely inundation areas, and probable damage by the flow. It is essential for the development of future warning systems that the variations that can occur within a single lahar are better understood, as lahars represent a serious threat to the slopes of many volcanoes worldwide...|$|E

Several cases are simulated in order to investigate the coolant temperature drop, heat transfer coefficient for the coolant and the air side along with the corresponding pressure drop. It is observed that the heat transfer and pressure drop fairly agree with experimental data.

Twenty-four healthy adults {{participated in the study}} and were assigned to either SLT (n= 12) or a control (CON) group (n= 12). The SLT group completed a four week training program, while the CON group received no training. Centre of gravity (COG) and joint angles (ankle, knee and hip) were calculated using whole body three-dimensional (3 D) kinematic measurements during single leg standing on a stable surface (SS) and on a perturbed surface (PS) before and after training. After SLT, a significant interaction was found for the SS condition in anterior-posterior COG mean velocity, whereas no changes were observed in the medio-lateral direction or in joint kinematics. In the PS condition, the medio-lateral COG mean <b>velocity,</b> <b>frontal</b> angular range of motion in the knee and hip joint, sagittal angular mean velocity in the knee joint, as well as <b>frontal</b> angular mean <b>velocity</b> in the hip joint were reduced in the SLT group only (all P< 0. 05).

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringFrom a {{multitude}} of laboratory studies conducted by various researchers during roughly the last 40 years (e. g. Hirasaki and Pope 1974, Heemskerk et al. 1984, Stavland et al. 2010), it has been identified that the behavior of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer solutions in porous media {{is more complicated than}} what the bulk rheology might suggest. For decades, laboratory studies have reported the existence of shear thickening and degradation flow regimes when HPAM polymers have been exposed to high <b>frontal</b> <b>velocities</b> during corefloods. Recently developed models have displayed the capacity to accurately predict numerical values for the apparent viscosity behavior of HPAM polymers in the shear thickening and degradation flow regimes without in-depth data from coreflood experiments. Having the ability to simulate this polymer behavior is valuable for selecting effective polymer flood design parameters, but doing this would be impossible if the simulation technology does not accurately reflect the experimental findings. This thesis sought {{to determine whether or not}} a commercially available simulator could accurately simulate results from both single- and two-phase polymer coreflood experiments conducted for a range of injection rates, which included rates that exhibiting polymer degradation behavior. The adherence to physically realistic input values with respect to experimentally derived parameters was of primary importance during the development of the models. When specific values were not available for certain simulation parameters, a reasonable range of values were investigated, and the best fitting results were selected. Through a methodical approach used to identify the best input values, two simulation models were created which produced results that were well matched with the experimental data. In the single phase simulation, the shear thinning, shear thickening, and degradation flow regimes were successfully modeled, but numerical issues arose for injection rates larger than 7. 5 mL/min. In the two phase water-wet simulation, the modeled polymer behavior spanned from the shear thinning to the shear thickening flow regimes, but did not include the degradation behavior. With this model, both the pressures and cumulative oil production were successfully matched. Ultimately, understanding how to simulate the polymer behavior on a core-scale will improve the ability to model polymer floods on the field-scale...|$|R
