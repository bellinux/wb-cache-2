40|$|Results of {{a survey}} of the level of access {{provided}} to selected free scholarly electronic journals by academic libraries is reported. A list of scholarly journals that are available electronically without any access limitations was compiled, and for each title the number of <b>holding</b> <b>institutions</b> on OCLC and its coverage by major abstracting and indexing services was determined. The twenty-five most popular titles, determined by number of <b>holding</b> <b>institutions</b> on OCLC, were searched on a random sample of library websites and catalogs to provide a separate gauge for access levels provided by institutions. Despite approximately half the titles being indexed by major vendors, including 88 % of the top twenty-five, access levels were fairly low and decreased dramatically with the size of the institution. The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and Journal of Extension provide examples of free ejournals with print counterparts. Approximately ½ and 1 / 3 of the institutions, respectively, only provide access to the print versions of those journals (and in the latter case, the print version is no longer produced, so no access to the current issues is provided) ...|$|R

Rather than being protections against harm, per se, I contend that human rights largely shield against risk impositions to protected interests. “Risk imposition” is a normative idea requiring explication, but understanding dutiful action in its terms enables human rights to provide prospective policy guidance, <b>hold</b> <b>institutions</b> accountable, operate in non-ideal circumstances, embody impartiality among persons, and define the moral status of agencies in international relations.

5000|$|Early {{cut sheet}} {{microforms}} and microfilms (to the 1930s) were printed on nitrate film, which poses high risks to their <b>holding</b> <b>institutions,</b> as nitrate film is explosive and flammable.

[...] Redox blemishes are yellow, orange or red spots 15-150 micrometres in diameter created by oxidative attacks on the film, and are largely due to poor storage conditions.|$|R

5000|$|Cultural {{heritage}} collections {{require a}} great deal of care and protection in order to ensure their safety from external loss or damage, but they also require in-depth documentation to assist in tracking the life of the object within the <b>holding</b> <b>institution.</b> To accommodate these needs, collectors adhere to collections management and collections care standards and practices, which serve to create a safe environment for collection objects with clear and precise accompanying documentation. Where collections care addresses the physical actions necessary to prevent or delay damages of cultural heritage, collection management can be defined as [...] "a process of information gathering, communication, coordination, policy formulation, evaluation, and planning." [...] These processes influence decisions about records management and the collections management policy, which outlines protocols for the collection scope, collections care, and emergency planning and response.|$|E

40|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of many former subaltern peoples and states resides in museums {{of their former}} colonial masters whether abroad or in the countries where they live. This {{can serve as a}} potent symbol of loss and humiliation. Repatriation of this heritage presents a significant challenge. Most museums operate policies that presume retention of heritage irrespective of the circumstances of its acquisition. Criteria are set which privilege the <b>holding</b> <b>institution</b> and which do not acknowledge the beliefs, custom and practise of the claimants. The contest over repatriation engages complex interacting systems. The museum operates within powerful systems of Western law, and its own ontology. The claimant group has little power other than its moral authority. Cultural rights would help redress that balance. But the recognition of cultural rights is not an international norm. This research paper uses a mixed methods approach to examine whether museum practise, and particularly museum practise in the United Kingdom, recognises cultural rights as indicated by their practise on repatriation...|$|E
