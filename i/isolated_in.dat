HSV <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clinical specimens and laboratory <b>isolates</b> were cultured <b>in</b> the absence or presence of 5 μg of ACV per ml. The frequency of ACV-resistant HSV was calculated as (average virus titer in the wells with ACV) /(average virus titer in the wells without ACV). The mutation frequency of HSV type 1 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clinical samples (directly from patient lesions) was 7. 5 × 10 − 4 ± 2. 5 × 10 − 4 (mean ± standard error), and that of HSV type 2 isolates was 15. 0 × 10 − 4 ± 4. 6 × 10 − 4. The mutation frequencies of <b>isolates</b> derived <b>in</b> the laboratory from these clinical samples were very similar. Similarly, the 50 % inhibitory concentrations for <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clinical samples and laboratory isolates were identical.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to genetically {{characterize}} Toxoplasma gondii isolates from free range chickens in regions of Brazilian territory in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) where T. gondii strains have never been studied. In total, T. gondii isolates from 22 free range chickens were included in this study. Fifty chickens from Eldorado, thirty from Rio Verde and ten from Aquidauana were sampled between January and April 2007. In relation to the genetic diversity of T. gondii <b>isolates</b> from chickens <b>in</b> MS, the magnitude of the diversity <b>in</b> the <b>isolates</b> sampled <b>in</b> this study was comparable to the overall diversity in a composite data set. These 22 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> MS revealed 11 genotypes, whereas the 321 <b>isolates</b> ever genotyped <b>in</b> Brazil have revealed 95 genotypes. The values of Simpson`s Diversity Index for the whole population of T. gondii <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> Brazil, the whole population of T. gondii <b>isolates</b> from chickens <b>in</b> Brazil and the population surveyed in this study were 0. 97, 0. 95 and 0. 90, respectively. Seven of the 11 genotypes revealed from chicken isolates from MS are newly described genotypes and six of them each have a single <b>isolate.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, the results obtained from <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> MS corroborate previous studies on T. gondii <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> Brazil, thus confirming their diversity and atypicality. Nonetheless, the applicability of PCR-RFLP markers for epidemiological inferences remains controversial. (c) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. CNP...|$|R

40|$|The culturability of {{microorganisms}} in a 10 cm core of an Australian pasture soil was investigated using a minimal agar medium with xylan as the growth substrate. Culturability decreased with increasing depth, from {{a maximum of}} 19 % of the total microscopically countable cells in the 0 - 2 cm section to 2. 4 % in the 8 - 10 cm section. Seventy-one isolates from the core were identified by comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Many of these isolates belong to groups of globally distributed soil bacteria, including well-characterized families of the classes Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, and of the subclass Actinobacteridae. Other isolates belong to groups with few or no cultivated representatives: 10 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> two subdivisions of the phylum Acidobacteria, five <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> a new order and nine <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> a new family of the class Alphaproteobacteria, two <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> a new order of the class Gammaproteobacteria, three <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> two new families of the subclass Actinobacteridae, and two <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> the subclass Rubrobacteridae.

40|$|Background: E. coli is {{regarded}} as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance in foods of animal origin. E. coli can be categories into four mainphylogenetic groups (A, B 1, B 2 and D). The commensal E. coli strains mostly are assigned to the phylo-groups A and B 1. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to determine the phylogenetic group/subgroups and antibiotic resistance patterns of ostrich E. coli <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 126 E. coli isolates were obtained from cloacae swabs of the healthy ostrich in Kerman, Iran. The E. coliisolates were confirmed using biochemical API 20 E identification system. The confirmed isolates were studied to determine phylogeneticbackground by PCR. The isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance against 12 different antibiotic disk by disk diffusion method. Results: Phylotyping of E. coli isolates indicated that 74 isolates belonged to A, 27 isolates to B 1, 7 isolates to B 2, and 18 isolates to D groups. Also the isolates fell into six phylogenetic subgroups, including 34 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> A 0, 40 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> A 1, one <b>isolate</b> <b>in</b> B 22, 6 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> B 23, 11 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> D 1 and 7 <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> subgroup D 2. In the examined E. coli isolates, the maximum rate of resistance was against tetracycline, andthe minimum rate of resistance was against amoxicillin. Twenty three antibiotic resistance patterns were detected among the isolates. Thecefoxitin and tetracycline resistance pattern was the most prevalent <b>in</b> the <b>isolates</b> that belonged to phylo-group A. Conclusions: In conclusion, the result of the present study revealed a low frequency of antibiotic resistance in ostrich E. coli isolates. The antibiotic resistance patterns were in relation to A and D phylogenetic groups. Further studies are needed to better understand thedistribution of phylogenetic groups <b>in</b> poultry <b>isolates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Leaf blotch {{and fruit}} spot of apple caused by Alternaria species occur in apple {{orchards}} in Australia. However, {{there is no}} information on {{the identity of the}} pathogens and whether one or more Alternaria species cause both diseases in Australia. Using DNA sequencing and morphological and cultural characteristics of 51 isolates obtained from apple leaves and fruit with symptoms in Australia, Alternaria species groups associated with leaf blotch and fruit spot of apples were identified. Sequences of Alternaria allergen a 1 and endopolygalacturonase gene regions revealed that multiple Alternaria species groups are associated with both diseases. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of the two genes resulted in four clades representing A. arborescens and A. arborescens-like <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clade 1, A. tenuissima/A. mali <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clade 2, A. alternata/A. tenuissima intermediate <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clade 3 and A. longipes and A. longipes-like <b>isolates</b> <b>in</b> clade 4.
