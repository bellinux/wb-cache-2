5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also <b>infest</b> humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally <b>infest</b> other animals such as rodents may <b>infest</b> humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E

40|$|In Africa, Typhlodromalus manihoti and T. aripo, two {{introduced}} predators of the cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa, occupy {{different parts}} of cassava foliage. In the present study, niche use by these two predators, as mediated by prey-induced infochemicals, was investigated. In response to prey feeding damage, cassava plant parts emit volatile blends, that attract phytoseiidae predators. When given a choice between old cassava leaves <b>infested</b> with M. tanajoa and either apices or young cassava leaves <b>infested</b> with M. tanajoa, T. aripo displayed a marked preference for odors emitted from either <b>infested</b> apices or <b>infested</b> young leaves over <b>infested</b> old leaves but showed no preference for odors from apices versus young leaves, all <b>infested</b> with M. tanajoa. Typhlodromalus manihoti did not discriminate between volatiles from the three <b>infested</b> cassava plant parts. Our data show that T. aripo uses differences in volatile blends released by <b>infested</b> cassava plant parts and restricts its fundamental niche to a realized niche, which enables coexistence with its competitor T. manihoti...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Effects {{of water}} stress and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycoperseci (Fol) {{on the growth}} of {{tomatoes}} were studied in a greenhouse experiment. Treatments consisted of five levels of water stress (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 day irrigation intervals). <b>Infested</b> soil consisting of 400 chlamydospores g 1 of Fol and non <b>infested</b> soil were used. Experiments arranged in a completely randomized design with 8 replications (4 <b>infested</b> and 4 non <b>infested</b> soil) under greenhouse conditions (18 - 35 0 C). Six week old tomato seedlings, cultivar Porimo, were exposed to water stress after transferring to <b>infested</b> and non <b>infested</b> soils. During the experiment, leaf area, final plant height, shoot dry weight and shoot nitrogen content were measured. Disease symptoms appeared earlier in treatments with high water stress than the other t reatments. Results showed that leaf area, final plant height, shoot dry weight and shoot nitrogen content were reduced both with increasing irrigation intervals and in <b>infested</b> soils. Root colonization by Fol increased with increasing irrigation intervals, but differences were not significant...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{white blood}} cell counts from Schizodon intermedius <b>infested</b> by Lernaea cyprinacea were carried out and {{compared}} using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. The observations were performed in fish <b>infested</b> by 16 - 77 adult Lernaea, fish with parasitic lesions but without attached crustaceans, and non parasitized fish (control group). The specimens of Schizodon intermedius were obtained from the University of Londrina fish farming facilities. The following leucocytes were observed: lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils and immature leucocytes. Intense lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia were observed in the <b>infested</b> hosts. Consistent increasing of monocyte percentage values occurred in the <b>infested</b> fish.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Cambial {{activity}} was studied in trees <b>infested</b> by the {{balsam woolly aphid}} and in non-infested trees of grand and subalpine fir. <b>Infested</b> and non-infested samples of grand fir were collected near Corvallis during 1968 and 1969. Samples of subalpine fir, noninfested and <b>infested,</b> were collected near Odell Lake, at approximately 5, 000 ft. elevation, during 1969. Light infestations of the aphid were observed in both species. No differences within species between <b>infested</b> and non-infested trees were noted {{in the number of}} overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells or in the dates for reactivation and cessation of mitotic activity in the cambial zone, or in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file. The relative amounts of xylem and phloem present at any given time during the growing season were the same regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} aphids. Significant differences were noted in the lengths of the fusiform initials in the <b>infested</b> samples when compared to non-infested samples in both species. Xylem production in grand fir, and phloem production in both species was significantly greater in <b>infested</b> samples. A greater number of phloem parenchyma strands were observed in <b>infested</b> samples of grand fir than in non-infested samples. The rate of cell division, as indicated by the mitotic indices, showed no significant differences between samples of <b>infested</b> and non-infested trees of either species. Differences in xylem and phloem production between <b>infested</b> and non-infested trees could not be attributed to either an increased rate of cell division or an increase in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file in <b>infested</b> samples for either species...|$|R

40|$|Cyphocharax gilbert shows {{parasitic}} castration when <b>infested</b> by the crustacean Riggia paranensis, {{being unable}} to reproduce. Fish were sampled in the middle rio Itabapoana, Brazil, to study the prevalence of parasitism, growth, and sex steroid concentrations, considering the body size, sex, and reproductive condition of specimens. Most of the fish analyzed were <b>infested</b> (56. 0 %). The presence of two lines on the scales was more frequent among <b>infested</b> fish (22. 0 %) than among fish without parasites (12. 0 % for females and 10. 0 % for males). The occurrence of three lines on the scales was rare (3. 5 % among <b>infested</b> and 2. 0 % among females without parasites). These results suggest that growth of the host is faster than that of non <b>infested</b> fish. The serum concentrations of sex steroids from fish without parasites varied at different gonadal development stages (17 beta-estradiol: 60. 0 to 976. 7 pg/ml; total testosterone: 220. 0 to 3, 887. 7 pg/ml). All <b>infested</b> fish had lower levels of the two sex steroids and undeveloped gonads. Sex steroids levels in <b>infested</b> females were close to those in females at post-spawning stages. Total testosterone concentrations of <b>infested</b> males were below those of males at early gonadal maturation stage.

40|$|Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) {{is one of}} {{the major}} citrus pests of {{economic}} importance for South Africa’s citrus industry. It is endemic to Africa, and therefore a phytosanitary pest with zero tolerance by most export markets. The cryptic nature of T. leucotreta makes visual inspection an inefficient method for detecting neonate larvae in fruit in the packhouse. Therefore, a more accurate method for sorting <b>infested</b> fruit at the packhouse, particularly for newly <b>infested</b> fruit could ensure market access. A recent study showed that fruit <b>infested</b> by T. leucotreta emit a chemical profile different from that of a healthy fruit. Several studies provide evidence that parasitoids locate their hosts feeding on fruit by exploiting the novel chemical profiles produced due to host herbivory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of using the naturally occurring behaviour of a larval parasitoid Agathis bishopi (Nixon) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) for detection of T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit, by determining which compound in <b>infested</b> fruit is attractive to parasitoids. Ytube olfactometer and flight-tunnel bioassays with healthy and T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit showed a significantly stronger response of A. bishopi female parasitoids to <b>infested</b> fruit. Among the volatile compounds associated with T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit, D-limonene elicited the strongest attraction to A. bishopi female parasitoids. Attraction of mated A. bishopi female parasitoids to T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit and D-limonene significantly increased after oviposition experience. Behavioural responses of A. bishopi female parasitoids that were associated with T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit were investigated to determine which behaviours are distinct and interpretable. Probing and oviposition behaviours were the most noticeable and were only elicited on <b>infested</b> fruit when parasitoids contacted T. leucotreta frass, indicating that chemical compounds in frass are short-range cues used for final host location. Since production of D-limonene by fruit is elevated due to herbivory by different pests including mechanical injury on fruit, response of A. bishopi female parasitoids to compounds in frass offers a more specific and potentially useful mechanism for development of a detection system for T. leucotreta <b>infested</b> fruit. Chemical analysis of T. leucotreta frass and conditioning A. bishopi parasitoids to respond behaviourally to compounds in frass is proposed...|$|R
