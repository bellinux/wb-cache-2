5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was {{difficult to deal with}} technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about the Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he might be forced to execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E
25|$|The Challengers, Ray Palmer, Firestorm, Una, Harley, Holly, and Mary Marvel {{attempt to}} <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about Karate Kid, who lays dying from the virus he's carrying. Solomon, the Monitor of Earth-8, arrives and sends {{everyone}} back to Earth. Jason leaves the group upon their arrival. Soon after, the group discovers {{that no one}} recognizes them, and that their homes and headquarters are not there. The group goes to see Dubbilex for help with Karate Kid, only to learn that he has already died. When Karate Kid's autopsy is performed, Morticoccus is accidentally released, grows and attacks the Challengers. The virus is captured by Rayner and explodes. However, it is discovered that the virus began spreading across the planet before the autopsy, causing infected humans to devolve into animalistic savages and infected animals to gain human-like traits. Una helps Buddy Blank reach his daughter's apartment and the two locate Buddy's daughter, who has been infected by the virus, and his grandson, who is immune. Una dies while protecting Buddy and his grandson from a swarm of rats, and gives Buddy her Legion Flight Ring, which he uses to take him and his grandson to Cadmus's Command D facility. The Challengers then leave the reconstituted Earth-51 and return home. After witnessing Darkseid's death, Jason returns to being a solo anti-hero while Donna, Kyle, Ray Palmer and Forager, along with the Monitor Nix Uotan, reform the Challengers and watch over the other Monitors.|$|E

The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts.

500|$|Two musical {{themes in}} Wicked run {{throughout}} the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works, the first– Elphaba's theme– came from The Survival of St. Joan, {{on which he}} worked as musical director. [...] "I always liked this tune a lot and I never could <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with it," [...] he remarked {{in an interview in}} 2004. The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's brass section, with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, [...] "like a giant shadow terrorizing you". When played by the piano with some electric bass in [...] "As Long As You're Mine", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered bridge, the theme forms the core of the song [...] "No One Mourns the Wicked" [...] and its reprises.|$|E
