40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>hydrogen-based</b> clean <b>energy</b> systems {{due to the}} global climate change, air pollu-tion and energy security has lead to several studies of hydrogen production, separation and storage in industry and science [1, 2]. In the current study, we have investigated the diffusion of hydrogen within a novel Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF- 7, Figure 1 a). ZIFs are a subfamily of porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [3, 4]. For investigating diffusion behavior of hydrogen in this lattice, we have applied Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. At the studied temperatures {{in a series of}} MD simulations performed with a rigid lattice, no diffusion of any gas was observed in ZIF- 7. The same behavior has been reported by A. Battisti et al.

The ongoing development of power-to-gas (PtG) technologies that supports large-scale utilization of hydrogen is therefore expected to support hydrogen economy with a final breakthrough.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis has been to develop an {{optimisation}} method for a <b>hydrogen-based</b> renewable <b>energy</b> supply system. The cost-effective application of such system is also analysed. The main cost intensive components, used in the system are optimised {{on the basis of}} the lifetime and the investment cost of the different components. The main cost intensive components are the renewable energy converter (REC), the battery, the electrolyser, the gas tank and the fuel cell. The sizes of the first four components are interdependent. A comparative analysis of hydrogen and diesel generator based renewable energy supply system is performed. Photovoltaic and wind energy converter is considered as energy converter and energy is supplied to a microwave repeater station. The hourly average solar radiation and wind speed for whole year as well as the load profile of the microwave repeater station is considered as input data for present optimisation method. In this optimisation method, the different components have different lifetime. It is expressed in different units. For example, the REC lifetime is expressed in year where as the battery life is expressed in full cycles and the electrolyser and fuel cell's lifetime is expressed in terms of operating hours. In present optimisation method the battery capacity is considered in such a way that the lifetime of the system becomes integer multiple of the battery lifetime. The life of the electrolyser, the fuel cell and the tank does not end at the end of the system's lifetime. The cost of the components at the end of the system's lifetime is calculated {{on the basis of the}} remaining lifetime of the components, general escalation and the discount rate. (orig.)

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} U. S. geographic {{analysis of}} the cost of hydrogen from electrolysis. Wind-based water electrolysis represents a viable path to renewably-produced hydrogen production. It might be used for <b>hydrogen-based</b> transportation fuels, <b>energy</b> storage to augment electricity grid services, or as a supplement for other industrial hydrogen uses. This analysis focuses on the levelized production, costs of producing green hydrogen, rather than market prices which would require more extensive knowledge of an hourly or daily hydrogen market. However, the costs of hydrogen presented here do include a small profit from an internal rate of return on the system. The cost of renewable wind-based hydrogen production is very sensitive to the cost of the wind electricity. Using differently priced grid electricity to supplement the system had only a small effect on the cost of hydrogen; because wind electricity was always used either directly or indirectly to fully generate the hydrogen. Wind classes 3 - 6 across the U. S. were examined and the costs of hydrogen ranged from $ 3. 74 kg to $ 5. 86 /kg. These costs do not quite meet the 2015 DOE targets for central or distributed hydrogen production ($ 3. 10 /kg and $ 3. 70 /kg, respectively), so more work is needed on reducing the cost of wind electricity and the electrolyzers. If the PTC and ITC are claimed, however, many of the sites will meet both targets. For a subset of distributed refueling stations where there is also inexpensive, open space nearby this could be an alternative to central hydrogen production and distribution...|$|R

40|$|Petroleum-based liquid {{hydrocarbons}} is exclusively major energy {{source in the}} transportation sector. Thus, it is the major CO{sub 2 } source which is the associated with greenhouse effect. In the United States alone, petroleum consumption in the transportation sector approaches 13. 8 {{million barrels per day}} (Mbbl/d). It is corresponding to a release of 0. 53 gigatons of carbon per year (GtC/yr), which accounts for approximate 7. 6 % of the current global release of CO{sub 2 } from all of the fossil fuel usage (7 GtC/yr). For the long term, the conventional petroleum production is predicted to peak in as little as the next 10 years to as high as the next 50 years. Negative environmental consequences, the frequently roaring petroleum prices, increasing petroleum utilization and concerns about competitive supplies of petroleum have driven dramatic interest in producing alternative transportation fuels, such as electricity-based, hydrogen-based and bio-based transportation alternative fuels. Use of either of electricity-based or <b>hydrogen-based</b> alternative <b>energy</b> in the transportation sector is currently laden with technical and economical challenges. The current energy density of commercial batteries is 175 Wh/kg of battery. At a storage pressure of 680 atm, the lower heating value (LHV) of H{sub 2 } is 1. 32 kWh/liter. In contrast, the corresponding energy density for gasoline can reach as high as 8. 88 kWh/liter. Furthermore, the convenience of using a liquid hydrocarbon fuel through the existing infrastructures is a big deterrent to replacement by both batteries and hydrogen. Biomass-derived ethanol and bio-diesel (biofuels) can be two promising and predominant U. S. alternative transportation fuels. Both their energy densities and physical properties are comparable to their relatives of petroleum-based gasoline and diesel, however, biofuels are significantly environmental-benign. Ethanol can be made from the sugar-based or starch-based biomass materials, which is easily fermented to create ethanol. In the United States almost all starch ethanol is mainly manufactured from corn grains. The technology for manufacturing corn ethanol can be considered mature as of the late 1980 s. In 2005, 14. 3 % of the U. S. corn harvest was processed to produce 1. 48 x 10 {sup 10 } liters of ethanol, energetically equivalent to 1. 72 % of U. S. gasoline usage. Soybean oil is extracted from 1. 5 % of the U. S. soybean harvest to produce 2. 56 x 10 {sup 8 } liters of bio-diesel, which was 0. 09 % of U. S. diesel usage. However, reaching maximum rates of bio-fuel supply from corn and soybeans is unlikely because these crops are presently major contributors to human food supplies through livestock feed and direct consumption. Moreover, there currently arguments on that the conversion of many types of many natural landscapes to grow corn for feedstock is likely to create substantial carbon emissions that will exacerbate globe warming. On the other hand, there is a large underutilized resource of cellulose biomass from trees, grasses, and nonedible parts of crops that could serve as a feedstock. One of the potentially significant new bio-fuels is so called "cellulosic ethanol", which is dependent on break-down by microbes or enzymes. Because of technological limitations (the wider variety of molecular structures in cellulose and hemicellulose requires a wider variety of microorganisms to break them down) and other cost hurdles (such as lower kinetics), cellulosic ethanol can currently remain in lab scales. Considering farm yields, commodity and fuel prices, farm energy and agrichemical inputs, production plant efficiencies, byproduct production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and other environmental effects, a life-cycle evaluation of competitive indicated that corn ethanol yields 25 % more energy than the energy invested in its production, whereas soybean bio-diesel yields 93 % more. Relative to the fossil fuels they displace, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced 12 % by the production and combustion of ethanol and 41 % by bio-diesel. Bio-diesel also releases less air pollutants per net energy gain than ethanol. Bio-diesel has advantages over ethanol due to its lower agricultural inputs and more efficient conversion. Thus, to be a viable alternative, a bio-fuel firstly should be producible in large quantities without reducing food supplies. In this aspect, larger quantity supplies of cellulose biomass are likely viable alternatives. U. S. Congress has introduced an initiative and subsequently rolled into the basic energy package, which encourages the production of fuel from purely renewable resources, biomass. Secondly, a bio-fuel should also provide a net energy gain, have environmental benefits and be economically competitive. In this aspect, bio-diesel has advantages over ethanol. The commonwealth of Kentucky is fortunate to have a diverse and abundant supply of renewable energy resources. Both Kentucky Governor Beshear in the energy plan for Kentucky "Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky's Future", and Kentucky Renewable Energy Consortium, outlined strategies on developing energy in renewable, sustainable and efficient ways. Smart utilization of diversified renewable energy resources using advanced technologies developed by Kentucky public universities, and promotion of these technologies to the market place by collaboration between universities and private industry, are specially encouraged. Thus, the initially question answering Governor's strategic plan is if there is any economical way to make utilization of larger quantities of cellulose and hemicellulose for production of bio-fuels, especially bio-diesel. There are some possible options of commercially available technologies to convert cellulose based biomass energy to bio-fuels. Cellulose based biomass can be firstly gasified to obtain synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and H{sub 2 }), which is followed up by being converted into liquid hydrocarbon fuels or oxygenate hydrocarbon fuel through Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis. Methanol production is regarded to be the most economic starting step in many-year practices of the development of F-T synthesis technology since only C{sub 1 } synthesis through F-T process can potentially achieve 100 % conversion efficiency. Mobil's F-T synthesis process is based on this understanding. Considering the economical advantages of bio-diesel production over ethanol and necessary supply of methanol during bio-diesel production, a new opportunity for bio-diesel production with total supplies of biomass-based raw materials through more economic reaction pathways is likely identified in this proposal. The bio-oil part of biomass can be transesterified under available methanol (or mixed alcohols), which can be synthesized in the most easy part of F-T synthesis process using synthesis gas from gasification of cellulose fractions of biomass. We propose a novel concept to make sense of bio-diesel production economically though a coupling reaction of bio-oil transesterification and methanol synthesis. It will overcome problems of current bio-diesel producing process based on separated handling of methanol and bio-oil...|$|R

The U. S. National Research Council has recommended the use of water-splitting technologies to produce hydrogen using energy derived from a nuclear reactor. For the past several years, the Idaho National Laboratory has been actively studying the use of solid oxide fuel cells in conjunction with nuclear power for large-scale, high-temperature, electrolytic hydrogen production...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} renewable energy sources. The use of hydrogen as fuel particularly in automotives is hampered by the lack of a safe and economical storage medium. Materials with high hydrogen storage capacities are desirable for storage applications. Carbon based materials are well known for its capability as absorbents due to its adsorptive and large surface area properties. Thus, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered to be a promising medium for hydrogen storage in <b>hydrogen-based</b> <b>energy</b> system. Since the pioneering report on the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in 1991 by Iijima, scientists and researchers worldwide are very interested to investigate in depth this new family of carbon because of its myriad properties and potential applications. In this study, CNT's have been successfully synthesized by using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) method. The as-synthesized CNTs were characterized using SEM/FE-SEM, EDAX, nitrogen adsorption (NA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The structures of CNT formed were dependent on the catalytic support used. The as-synthesized CNTs are expected to have good storage capacity for hydrogen and fuel cell application...|$|E
