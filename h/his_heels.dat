5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Slipknot began touring at {{the first}} ever Mayhem Festival, a music festival founded by Kevin Lyman and John Reese. During the opening date of the Mayhem Festival 2008 on July 9 at Auburn, Washington, turntablist Sid Wilson broke both of <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> after jumping from an {{elevated}} area of the stage and landing incorrectly. Despite the injury, he promised to perform on all dates of the tour in a wheelchair. Wilson returned to the band, in a wheelchair and with both his legs in casts, on the second date of the festival at Mountain View, California; he did, however, perform without the wheelchair at times.|$|E
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E
5|$|Died with a {{toothache}} in <b>his</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{turned on}} <b>his</b> <b>heel!</b> <b>His</b> muttered speech was profane, but inarticulate. He sprang into the hansom by Grahame's side.|$|R
5|$|And he died wid de toofache in <b>his</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|R
25|$|Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, himself {{acutely aware}} of the dire {{consequences}} of the fall of Ulm, was planning to move towards Vienna, in order to reinforce the remains of the Austrian army and link up with the Russians. However, in order to avoid having Masséna's men on <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> he decided to suddenly turn and face the French, hoping that by defeating them he would ensure the success of his march towards inner Austria.|$|E
25|$|Hot on <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> is the leprechaun Og, {{desperate to}} recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those {{involved}} in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do-well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in dance; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an African-American botanist determined to grow mentholated tobacco; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his bigotry {{as if it were a}} badge of honor.|$|E
25|$|As the {{campaign}} entered week 2, it was {{anticipated that the}} Liberals would push a series of highly negative ads to combat advertising by the Conservatives that attacked Dalton McGuinty. However, instead they went positive and stayed positive throughout {{the campaign}}. It was Eves who went on the defensive as the Liberals worked the media to put the Premier on <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> Stung by years of arrogance by the PC Party toward reporters, the media were quick to pile on.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas bowed, and bidding him good-morning, turned upon <b>his</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|R

60|$|Sir Rowland snorted, and, {{turning on}} <b>his</b> <b>heel,</b> {{made for the}} door.|$|R
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{success of}} Casablanca redefined Bogart's career. For the first time, Bogart could be cast successfully {{as both a}} tough, strong man and vulnerable love interest. Despite his elevated standing, he {{did not yet have}} a contractual right of script refusal. When he got weak scripts he simply dug in <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> and locked horns again with the front office, as he did on the film Conflict (1945). Though he submitted to Jack Warner on it, he successfully turned down God is My Co-Pilot (1945).|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Bird had {{the best}} {{statistical}} season of his career, but the Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals. Bird started the 1988–89 season, but ended his season after six games to have bone spurs surgically removed from both of <b>his</b> <b>heels.</b> He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, through the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. He averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists a game in his last three seasons with the Celtics, and shot better than 45% from the field in each. Bird led the Celtics to playoff appearances in each of those three seasons.|$|E
25|$|This time though, the openers began solidly {{putting on}} 50 {{for the first}} time in the series. When Ramesh was dismissed, Ganguly sent in VVS Laxman. Rahul Dravid had been {{struggling}} for runs for a while and Laxman had been stroking the ball well before his unfortunate dismissal. Interestingly, Laxman had been asked to open the innings in this match but had refused. He seemed to pick up from where he had left off, batting serenely, and at times aggressively – a reminder that there were no demons in the pitch. Das departed, unfortunate to hit the stumps with <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> while having executed an immaculate pull shot to end a promising partnership with Laxman. Tendulkar soon followed, for a second failure in the match but Laxman found a willing ally in Sourav Ganguly. The pair set about repairing the damage done raising a hundred for the 4th wicket, but just when it seemed India would end the day with some semblance of balance, McGrath induced an edge that was lapped up gleefully by Gilchrist to dismiss Ganguly 2 runs short of a deserved half century. Out came Rahul Dravid, with scorecard reading 232/4. Laxman duly completed a hundred in Dravid's company.|$|E
60|$|And turning upon <b>his</b> <b>heel,</b> {{without another}} word he quitted the apartment.|$|R

25|$|The 2011–12 {{season for}} the Tar Heels was more {{successful}} despite numerous injuries to key players. With losses to UNLV, Kentucky {{as well as a}} 33-point defeat against Florida State, Williams guided <b>his</b> <b>Heels</b> to another ACC Regular Season Championship after defeating Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium to close out the regular season (Duke won the first meeting in Chapel Hill). UNC entered the 2012 ACC Tournament as the #1 seed. The Heels beat Maryland in the quarterfinals and NC State in the semifinals. John Henson injured his wrist in the Maryland game and did not play in the semifinals or championship game where UNC lost to Florida State, 85-83. UNC was then awarded the #1 seed in the Midwest bracket of the 2012 NCAA Tournament. Without Henson, Dexter Strickland and sixth-man Leslie McDonald (who were both sidelined with season-ending injuries) Carolina beat Vermont {{in the second round of}} the Tournament. Henson returned to the lineup for the third-round game against Creighton. The Heels defeated Creighton, however starting PG Kendall Marshall injured his wrist in the second half of that game. Marshall had to undergo surgery and was unable to play for the rest of the season. Carolina turned to first-year PG Stilman White who helped lead the Heels to an OT win over the Ohio Bobcats in the Sweet 16. Carolina then faced #2 seed Kansas in the Elite Eight. Greatly undermanned, the Heels played Kansas close but Kansas pulled ahead late for the win. Roy Williams' 2011-2012 team finished the season with a record of 32-6, 14-2 in the ACC.|$|E
500|$|Turntablist Sid Wilson broke both of <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> after {{jumping from}} an {{elevated}} {{area of a}} stage and landing incorrectly. He performed all dates of the tour, in a wheelchair. Drummer Joey Jordison suffered a broken ankle, causing four concerts to be cancelled. Towards {{the end of the}} leg Fehn left the tour due to a [...] "tragic death in his family", forcing him to miss the final two dates of the leg in Spain. Shawn Crahan left the Canadian part of the tour to return home to his family.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was educated}} at Camden Street Junior School and Loughborough Grammar School. Johnson's uncle, Edgar Charles Rossell, {{who had won}} the Military Cross with the Royal Fusiliers in 1916, paid for Johnson's {{education}} at Loughborough. According to his brother Ross, during his time there, Johnson was nearly expelled after refusing punishment for a misdemeanour, believing it to be unjustified: [...] "he was very principled and simply dug <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> in". Among Johnson's hobbies and interests were shooting and sports; he shot rabbits and birds in the local countryside.|$|E
60|$|Without remark, Moosa {{turned on}} <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> and {{proceeded}} to obey orders.|$|R
60|$|John Dory muttered {{something}} between his lips, {{and turned on}} <b>his</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{right angles}} to this line the pirate now stepped forward, making as before seven long paces. Then he stopped, dug <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> into the ground, and beckoned to his men. Up they came running, {{carrying}} picks and spades, and with great alacrity they began to dig {{at the place where}} the captain had marked with <b>his</b> <b>heel.</b>|$|R
500|$|On 14September, {{on their}} way back to Framheim, they left most of their {{equipment}} at the 80°S depot, to lighten the sledges. Next day, in freezing temperatures with a strong headwind, several dogs froze to death while others, too weak to continue, were placed upon the sledges. On 16September, [...] from Framheim, Amundsen ordered his men to push for home as quickly as possible. Not having a sledge of his own, he leapt onto Wisting's, and with Helmer Hanssen and his team raced away, leaving the rest behind. The three arrived back at Framheim after nine hours, followed by Stubberud and Bjaaland two hours later and Hassel shortly after. [...] Johansen and Prestrud were still out on the ice, without food or fuel; Prestrud's dogs had failed, and <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> were badly frostbitten. They reached Framheim after midnight, more than seventeen hours after they had turned for home.|$|E
500|$|Following {{performances}} by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, The Jacksons {{took to the}} stage for their first group performance together in eight years. The brothers sang a medley of their old hits. After they finished with [...] "I'll Be There", they left Michael alone on stage. He addressed the audience and then went into his routine. He wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose—his right hand on his hat and his left leg bent. During a musical interlude, the singer executed a move that many believe to have sealed {{his status as a}} pop icon. Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun on <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> and landed en pointe. It was the first time Jackson had performed the moonwalk in public; he had practiced it in his kitchen prior to the show.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Haber was loaned {{out for a}} third time, joining Scottish Premier League side St Johnstone on a season-long loan. On signing Haber for the season, St Johnstone manager Derek McInnes stated — [...] "West Brom {{have high}} hopes for him but having stepped up a level into the Premiership {{they wanted him to}} go out on loan rather than be kicking <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> at The Hawthorns. He is young, hungry, has real pace and he's keen to learn". A day later, he played in Alan Main's {{testimonial}} match, against a Manchester United XI. Haber made his competitive debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Hearts on August 14, 2010, playing the opening 72 minutes of the match. He scored his first goal for the club five weeks later, on September 21, as he ran onto Alan Maybury's pass to finish neatly as St Johnstone beat Queen of the South 3–0 in the Scottish League Cup. He quickly doubled his goal tally when he scored in the club's 2–0 home league victory over Hibernian on October 2, 2010, coming on as a late second-half substitute and doubling St Johnstone's advantage in injury-time. After making 14 appearances, and scoring twice, during {{the first three months of}} the season, Haber snapped his anterior cruciate ligament in a 3–0 home defeat to Kilmarnock on November 6, 2010, turning [...] "awkwardly on the slick McDiarmid Park surface" [...] in [...] "an innocuous incident". He returned to West Brom to undergo surgery, with the injury ultimately ruling Haber out for the remainder of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Blake's Victorian biographer Alexander Gilchrist (1828–1861) wrote that, {{three decades}} earlier in 1790, [...] "Blake, {{for the only}} time in his life, saw a ghost... Standing one evening at his garden-door in Lambeth, and chancing to look up, he saw a horrible grim figure, 'scaly, speckled, very awful,' {{stalking}} downstairs towards him. More frightened than ever before or after, he took to <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> and ran out of the house." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....among spruce, birch and {{oak trees}} romped flying squirrels, roamed roe deer, elk and wild boar. Mole and shrew {{tunnelled}} through the grounds. And: Beavers damming {{the waters of}} the juvenile Neckar river. Hares flitted and horses galloped across open landscapes. Theoretically, nature provided steaks of elephant, the woolly rhinoceros and hippopotamus. Whether the [...] "Heidelberger" [...] ventured on such prey, must be doubted. Almost certainly he took to <b>his</b> <b>heels</b> in front of bear, wolf, leopard, saber-toothed cat and hyena." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "To proceed, {{if anyone}} amongst {{you used to}} worship Muhammad, then Muhammad has passed away, but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die. Allah said, [...] "And Muhammad is but a messenger; the {{messengers}} have come before him; if then he dies or is killed will you turn back upon your heels? And whoever turns back upon <b>his</b> <b>heels,</b> he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful." [...] (3.144) ...|$|E
