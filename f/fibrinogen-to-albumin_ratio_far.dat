50|$|In the United States and Canada, {{floor space}} ratio (FSR) and floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> are both used.|$|R
5000|$|The school distinguishes {{itself through}} a {{curriculum}} that focuses on [...] "Faith and the Arts" [...] with a student-to-teacher <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> smaller than traditional public high schools.|$|R
5000|$|The {{floor area}} <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> {{can be used}} in zoning {{to limit the number of}} people that a {{building}} can hold instead of controlling a building's external shape.|$|R
50|$|Common {{exclusions}} to {{the total}} calculation of square footage {{for the purpose of}} floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, stair towers, elevator shafts, and parking garages.|$|R
50|$|Floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> is the <b>ratio</b> of a building's total {{floor area}} (zoning floor area) {{to the size}} of the piece of land upon which it is built. The terms can also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio.|$|R
40|$|Pyroelectric {{conversion}} {{in space}} deserves {{a close look}} as preliminary calculations indicate that a system specific power of 350 to 850 watts per kilogram will be feasible. This power-to-weight <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> exceeds state-of-the-art photovoltaic systems (40 to 66 watts/kg) and surpasses proposed thin blanket photovoltaics (about 300 watts/kg). In addition to its high specific power, the pyroelectric approach promises to be far less expensive than photovoltaics...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{the zoning}} code from the 1950s, a 2:1 floor-area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> was adopted for East Colfax. These ratios determine the square {{footage of the}} building {{in relation to the}} lot size. Builders in the 1950s who tore down historic buildings along East Colfax for the purpose of developing a brand new property were required to abide by the car-friendly codes and provide for automobile use.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of tire hydroplaning at highway speeds reveal, {{in addition to}} inflation pressure, tire-footprint aspect <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR),</b> defined as width divided by length of tire surface in contact with pavement, significantly influences speed at which dynamic hydroplaning begins. Tire speeds and forces developed during tests of up to 65 mi/h (105 km/h) were monitored on flooded test surface to identify development of hydroplaning. Study focused on automotive tires because FAR's of automotive tires vary more than those of aircraft tires...|$|R
50|$|Opponents of the {{building}} charge that DMCI Homes violated Manila's zoning laws by seeking to build a 49-story high-rise residential building {{in an area where}} only school and government buildings of up to seven floors may be constructed. Furthermore, the local zoning ordinance covering the condominium's lot specifies a maximum floor-to-area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> of 4—that is, the total floor area must not be more than four times the lot area. As designed, Torre de Manila's FAR was 7.79, almost twice the allowed limit.|$|R
50|$|Probabilistic {{forecast}} skill scores may use metrics {{such as the}} Ranked Probabilistic Skill Score (RPSS) or the Continuous RPSS (CRPSS), among others. Categorical skill metrics such as the False Alarm <b>Ratio</b> (<b>FAR),</b> the Probability of Detection (POD), the Critical Success Index (CSI), and Equitable Threat Score (ETC) {{are also}} relevant for some forecasting applications. Skill is often, but not exclusively, expressed as the relative representation that compares the forecast performance of a particular forecast prediction {{to that of a}} reference, benchmark prediction—a formulation called a 'Skill Score'.|$|R

At the same time these developments have given equal opportunity for the construction and destruction. Among the destructive activities that arose of late or mostly based on IT related internet developments which enforced to expand the criminal activities across the globe using email as the media.

In the present note we try to evaluate the optimum input longitudinal emittance {{with respect to the}} space charge induced emittance growth as well as to evaluate the range of the longitudinal emittances where the beam motion is still far from the resonances with the nominal optics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAir path {{control of}} a spark {{ignition}} engine without an EGR loop, equipped with variable-valve-timing (VVT) actuators, is addressed in this paper. VVT devices are used to produce internal exhaust gas recirculation, providing beneficial effects in terms of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions reduction. However, VVT actuators affect the fresh air charge in the cylinders. This {{has an impact on}} the torque output (leading to driveability problems) and on the fuel/air <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> (leading to pollution peaks). To compensate for these undesirable effects, a new approach is proposed. Supportive experimental results show the relevance of this approach...|$|R
40|$|The area {{of crime}} {{investigation}} has extended its roots to cyber media and has emerged exponentially with the technological strides. Among the various media used in Digital Forensics, Email Forensics {{took up the}} leading segment. In order to investigate the cyber crimes, there is an immense need to analyze the bulky email gatherings forensically. Data mining methods help in analyzing these large collections of data. Mixtures of data mining models along with the related methodologies are proposed in this paper to facilitate the email forensic assessor.

50|$|One of the {{purposes}} of the 1916 zoning ordinance of New York City was to prevent tall buildings from obstructing too much light and air. The 1916 zoning ordinance sought to control building size by regulating height and setback requirements for towers. In 1961, a revision to the zoning ordinance introduced the concept of floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR).</b> Buildings built before 1961 often have FARs that would be unachievable today, such as the Empire State Building which has an FAR of 25 - meaning that it earns considerably greater rent than a newer building on the same land could hope for.|$|R
50|$|In most {{of their}} chalcogenides, {{transition}} metals adopt oxidation states of II or greater. Nonetheless, several examples exist where the metal/chalcogenide <b>ratio</b> is <b>far</b> less than one. Such compounds typically have extensive metal-metal bonding.|$|R
50|$|A {{build-out}} calculation multiplies {{the land}} area by density factors. Residential density {{is most often}} expressed as residential dwelling units per acre (DU/ac), but a minimum lot size is also used (especially in zoning). (Note: outside the United States, the metric system usually uses hectares as the area unit of measurement). A floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> typically describes non-residential development, based on the ratio of building floor space to land area, both using the same unit of measure. Additional analysis might estimate the number of buildings or building coverage {{based on the number}} of dwelling units per building, the number of stories and/or the building size in square feet.|$|R
40|$|Investment-driven {{growth has}} long been {{regarded}} as a key development strategy in China. This paper investigates empirically the validity of this view. Post- 1990 data analyses and macroeconometric model simulations show that market demand has become a regular force in driving investment since reforms, that non-demand-driven investment growth contributes to increasing capital-output <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> more than output growth, that government investment exerts {{a pivotal role in}} amplifying investment cycles, albeit effective in promoting employment, and that delayed and rising consumption from current investment surge can help sustain the impact of growth even with constant-returns-to-scale in the long-run GDP.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{bounding box}} Gabor filter based minutiae extraction scheme for fingerprint recognition system is presented. The proposed method uses improving alternatives for the image enhancement process, leading consequently {{to an increase}} of the reliability in the minutiae extraction task. In the first stages, image normalization, median filtering and orientation field of the fingerprint are calculated. The local orientation of the ridges will serve as parameter for the next processing stages. Details for the morphological filtering used to ridge extraction and back ground noise elimination are described. Conclusions in terms of GAR (Genuine Acceptance <b>ratio),</b> <b>FAR</b> (False acceptance <b>ratio)</b> and FRR (False rejection ratio) of this method are compared with Gabor filter based approach...|$|R
50|$|Floor Area <b>Ratios</b> (<b>FAR)</b> are {{recommended}} by the national government to manage growth and {{have been used to}} deter landowners from building homes outside the growth boundaries (city/town zones) of each suburb. It is common practice to violate the FARs by building structures that are larger than recommended, with many suburban homes being in direct violation of Greek planning laws. Only recently have actions been taken on by the government to extend the growth boundaries, create new much needed urban layouts and address current issues by introducing new planning laws. However actual implementation of such actions for each municipality is usually expected to be complete in 5 years time, from the time that the government announced it.|$|R
40|$|Maximum {{floor area}} <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> {{regulation}} is widely imposed in cities to mitigate negative population externalities (e. g. congestion). This paper presents determination of optimal FAR regulation in a two-zone {{city with a}} growing population. Results show the following. 1) Maximum FAR regulation alone is generally insufficient. It should be accompanied by minimum FAR regulation in one zone. 2) Optimal regulation {{at a particular time}} depends on expected changes in zonal populations over the longest replacement time among newly built buildings at that time. 3) Zonal optimal FAR is expected to vary with time, which might even necessitate replacement of maximum FAR with minimum FAR, and vice versa.

40|$|Cities are {{structured}} into sub-units {{such as the}} city center or business districts and peripheral areas. From a spatial perspective, discrimination or delineation of the city center is a very challenging task as there exist numerous ways to characterize city centers: besides functional characteristics, also morphological features can be used. In this paper, we present a study which links the floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> with individual perception of citizens to investigate the correlation between perception and morphology. Urban morphology from large-area digital surface models from Cartosat- 1 and socio-economic panel data is used to identify a potential perceptional border between the city center and the periphery when the FAR drops below 50...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the urban indicators analysis conducted within Warsaw’s ventilation corridors from 1992 to 2011. The literature review shows that the Floor Area <b>Ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> index {{is one of the best}} indicators to detect urban development; therefore, this was the core of the analysis. Three periods were analysed (1992 – 2002 – 2011), as such a long time-span allows the assumption that change will be visible. The ventilation corridors were divided into 500 m and 100 m grids and the FAR index was calculated for each cell. The results highlight alarming changes within some of the corridors, indicating areas that are crucial to sufficient air flow in Warsaw...|$|R
50|$|Variable density (VD) {{recording}} systems {{developed from}} Movietone gradually lost market share to variable area (VA) ones developed from Photophone from the 1940s onwards, {{a process that}} gathered pace as VA-related patents expired. Though both methods are theoretically capable of achieving similar standards of recording, duplication and reproduction, quality control in the lab proved {{to be far more}} critical in the duplication of VD tracks than VA ones: slight errors in printer light settings and sensitometry and densitometry control will affect the signal-to-noise <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> more on a VD track than on a VA one. For this reason archives have tended to remaster original VD tracks to VA negatives for preservation and the creation of new prints.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} a muon {{collider}} is ideally suited {{for the study of}} heavy H/A scalars, cousins of the Higgs boson found in two-Higgs-doublet models and required in supersymmetric models. The key aspects of H/A are: (1) they are narrow, yet have a width-to-mass <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> larger than the expected muon collider beam-energy resolution, and (2) the larger muon Yukawa allows efficient s-channel production. We study in detail a representative Natural Supersymmetry model which has a 1. 5 TeV H/A with mH−mA= 10 GeV. The large event rates at resonant peak allow the determination of the individual H and A resonance parameters (including CP) and the decays into electroweakinos provide a wealth of information unavailable to any other present or planned collider...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies on}} {{influences}} by setback regulation and height control to building activities through simulating using building form models which satisfy relating regulations {{in a case}} of residential zoning area. As result of the study it is clarified that the combination of building form and site figure which could satisfy most easily the setback regulations is oblong in the depth direction and their layout possible range becomes smaller according to the bigger designated floor area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> because its building coverage ratio also becomes bigger. Height control 12 m in area of 200 % FAR and 15 m in area of 300 % FAR are easily satisfied and these height control would be effective to realize better landscape using with the setback regulation...|$|R
50|$|Reciprocity {{failure is}} an {{important}} effect {{in the field of}} film-based astrophotography. Deep-sky objects such as galaxies and nebulae are often so faint that they are not visible to the un-aided eye. To make matters worse, many objects' spectra do not line up with the film emulsion's sensitivity curves. Many of these targets are small and require long focal lengths, which can push the focal <b>ratio</b> <b>far</b> above 5. Combined, these parameters make these targets extremely difficult to capture with film; exposures from 30 minutes to well over an hour are typical. As a typical example, capturing an image of the Andromeda Galaxy at 4 will take about 30 minutes; to get the same density at 8 would require an exposure of about 200 minutes.|$|R

The completion of the LIC Building in 1959, the tallest building in the country at that time, marked the transition from lime-and-brick construction to concrete columns in the region. The presence of the weather radar at the Chennai Port, however, prohibited the construction of buildings taller than 60m around a radius of 10km. In addition, the floor-area <b>ratio</b> (<b>FAR)</b> in the central business district is also 1.5, much less than that of smaller cities of the country. This resulted in the city expanding horizontally, unlike other metropolitan cities where vertical growth is prominent. On the contrary, the peripheral regions, especially on the southern and south-western sides, are experiencing vertical growth with the construction of buildings up to 60 floors.|$|R

The objective is to maintain the in-cylinder FAR at a prescribed set point, determined primarily {{by the state of}} the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC), so that the pollutants in the exhaust are removed with the highest efficiency. The FAR controller must also reject disturbances due to canister vapor purge and inaccuracies in air charge estimation and wall-wetting (WW) compensation. Two adaptive controller designs are consid-ered. The first design is based on feedforward adaptation while the second design is based on both feedback and feedforward adaptation incorporating the recently developed Adaptive Posicast Controller (APC).
