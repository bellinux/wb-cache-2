5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled {{out of the tunnel}} for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just {{a few inches from}} the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
60|$|Harry led {{him forward}} where the boat's sheer was higher {{and he could}} stand a couple of <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the water.|$|R
60|$|The {{kitchen was}} a little out-house, not unlike a {{gigantic}} dog-kennel, separated by a space of six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the principal dwelling.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{a hundred}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away, {{she saw a}} patch of violently {{disturbed}} snow--snow stained a dreadful colour, a snow of scarlet crystals! Three strides and Trafford was in sight.|$|R
500|$|The burnt baby {{skeleton}} {{was built}} from scratch. Originally, {{the crew had}} planned on renting a real fetal skeleton, but the $3,000 cost forced them to make their own. Office manager Donovan Brown noted that, [...] "we got {{two or three of}} those adults skeleton models, cut a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> off a leg here and shortened an arm there, glued them together to a plaster model of a fetal skull we found, and put together something that worked wonderfully".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Fawkes {{called the}} trolley his Aerial Swallow, a cigar-shaped, {{suspended}} monorail {{driven by a}} propeller that he promised would carry passengers from Burbank to downtown Los Angeles in 10minutes. The first open car accommodated about 20 passengers and was suspended from an overhead track and supported by wooden beams. In 1911, the monorail car made its first and only run through his Burbank ranch, with a line between Lake and Flower Streets. The monorail was considered a failure after gliding just a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and falling to pieces. Nobody was injured but Joseph Fawkes' pride was badly hurt as Aerial Swallow became known as [...] "Fawkes' Folly." [...] City officials viewed his test run as a failure and focused on getting a Pacific Electric Streetcar line into Burbank.|$|E
2500|$|The chancel {{still remains}} in the east wing and has some reconstructed colonial features. It is on a {{platform}} raised a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the church floor. On {{either side of the}} window opening are simple rectangular tablets bearing on the left The Lord’s Prayer above the Apostles' Creed and on the right Exodus XX (The Ten Commandments) under which is printed the Summary of the Law. In the middle is a reredos, obviously of non-colonial origin with an opening for the window incorporated within it. It bears, from the top down: 1) a cross placed so as to intersect center of the circular window; 2) a truncated tympanum, 3) a square-columned pilaster {{on either side of the}} window, and 4) a bottom forming a flat window sill. [...] The chancel is physically separated from the rest of the church by [...] vertical panels a few feet north and south of the window openings and a rail with 8 turned balusters on either side and a central opening. There are south and north facing [...] seats in the space between the side panels and the outer walls, on the north a built-in slip pew and on the south a short bench.|$|E
60|$|After {{crawling}} {{for forty}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> over this caked mud, Smith suddenly {{found himself on}} a rising stair. Then he understood the plan; the tomb itself was on a higher level.|$|R
6000|$|Arrived at the Shubak al-Nabi, Hamid {{took his}} stand about six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{out of reach}} of the railing, and at that respectful {{distance}} from, and facing[FN#33] the Hazirah (or presence), ...|$|R
25|$|In California and Geneva (Switzerland), ravens {{have been}} {{witnessed}} taking walnuts into their beaks, flying up to 60 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in the air, and dropping {{them to the}} ground to crack the shells and eat the nut inside.|$|R
2500|$|In the WomensWallStreet articles, Jacobsen {{detailed}} the activity {{she took to}} be suspicious. She claimed that before boarding, the men did not interact or seem {{to be part of}} a group. [...] Further, she claimed that during boarding, each man made eye contact with each of the others and nodded as if in agreement. One man, who wore an orthopedic shoe, complained loudly, just before takeoff, that he needed to switch seats. Once in flight, one of the men took a large McDonald's bag to a lavatory, exiting with the bag nearly empty, and giving the thumbs up sign as he passed two other suspicious men. Some of the other men also took objects with them to the lavatory, such as a mass of cloth, a camera, and a cell phone. Throughout the flight, the men would get up in unison, walk to the lavatories, and congregate in the aisles in groups of two and three. One of the men, wearing a suit and sunglasses, stood a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away from the cockpit door. When the captain announced clearance for landing, seven of the men stood in unison and went to the lavatory, each taking about four minutes. The last man to exit the lavatory supposedly dragged his forefinger across his neck as he passed one of the other men, mouthing the word [...] "No." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} folded {{himself up}} another <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> until his knees {{were higher than}} his head, and lit a cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|... "But Mr.--Mr. Lee--listen to me, will you?" [...] {{burst out}} Neale. [...] "It's all {{here in my}} notes. You've hurried over the line and you just slipped up a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in your {{observations}} of that section." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on the upper}} {{surfaces}} of the leaves on rutaceous plants at ten <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above the ground. The newly laid egg is spherical and light green but darkens over time to orange yellow.|$|R
50|$|The falls {{can be seen}} {{partially}} {{seen from}} Clear Creek Road from where it crosses Asbestos Creek and views of the upper 500 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the falls can likely only be attained {{from the other side}} of the valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course not}} quite so tall as yourself, say six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> with a slight, {{feminine}} beard--no? you shake your head; well, smooth-faced and rosy, immense breadth of shoulders--ah! I have often pictured to myself that sister of yours--" ...|$|R
60|$|In another instant {{we were at}} {{the edge}} of the cliff, and a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> below us was spread the dense, impenetrable blanket of mist. I stopped and hesitated, for the next step might be my last.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] he whispered. [...] "Jove, he's gone a {{long way}} with it, too!" [...] he muttered, looking upward. [...] "Another <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and he would have been outside. I wonder the place didn't collapse." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} door {{suddenly}} quite wide, but he made no motion to depart. On the contrary two men, who must have been standing within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of it, stepped quickly in. Phineas Duge closed the door.|$|E
60|$|He had again {{approached}} to within three <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> {{and again the}} playful steed had protruded its nose and even touched his hand, but before that hand could grasp the halter, tail and heels were in the air, and away it went a second time.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] he {{said with}} a moan. [...] "Each step now is {{carrying}} us lower. I remember hearing some of the old hands say the abandoned drifts were a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> farther down the hill. We must be considerably below the deepest shaft." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bensington evidently {{enjoyed his}} line of high {{intellectual}} detachment. [...] "The thing that interests me most, Redwood, of all this, is to think that his brain {{at the top of}} him will also, so far as my reasoning goes, be five-and-thirty <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above our level.... What's the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it IS strange," [...] remarked {{the small}} {{voice of the}} kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the air a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away {{from the edge of}} the roof.|$|E
60|$|The indefatigable {{stage manager}} ran {{in and out}} among us while we sang, driving this couple back a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> this other forward, herding this group closer together, {{throughout}} another making space, suggesting {{the idea of a}} sheep-dog at work.|$|E
6000|$|... "A <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of steel," [...] Rotherby explained, {{and struck}} the hilt of his sword. [...] "I might pick a quarrel with him. 'Twould not be difficult. Come upon him unawares, say, and strike him. That should force a fight." ...|$|E
50|$|Eilean Bàn now {{supports}} a pier of the Skye Bridge, built during the 1990s. Despite modern traffic a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above it, {{the island is}} a commemorative otter sanctuary and houses a museum dedicated to Maxwell. Another memorial is a bronze otter erected in the grounds of Port William Golf Course.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} manned flight {{was made in}} a hot air balloon built by the Montgolfier brothers on 21 November 1783. The flight started in Paris and reached a height of 500 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The pilots, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes, covered about 5½ miles in 25 minutes.|$|R
60|$|The {{smallest}} of the pines rose two hundred feet above her; and they ran up until they dwindled to insignificance far aloft {{at the foot of}} a great scarp of rock that rose beyond them for a thousand <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and then gave place in turn to climbing fields of snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "You missed me twice," [...] {{he began}} coolly, {{shifting}} both pistols to one hand. [...] "The last time within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By every rule of single combat your life belongs to me. That {{does not mean}} that I want to take it now." ...|$|E
60|$|The big {{weighing}} machines {{had been}} pushed into corners, and all round the sloping walls swords, cullivers and muskets were piled in orderly array, also a row of iron boxes standing a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart from one another and away from any other objects in the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{heart and}} lungs! I never {{see such a}} boy," [...] so I present Carshot's refrain; and {{even when he was}} within a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the customer's face the disciplined ear of Kipps would still at times develop a featureless, {{intercalary}} murmur into--well, [...] "my heart and lungs!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the external landing bay are shown as very expansive. Vipers are shown making combat landings and sliding or skipping a considerable distance with no automated arresting device to stop them. From what is seen on the TV series Colonial One can dock on one of Glacticas flight pods with relative ease. It appears Colonial One is small to midsize ship about 500-600 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in length (as seen in the pilot she has a large cargo hangar that can hold a Viper and still has considerable room left over, and we are told in the pilot (E1, p1) can hold close to 150 people) and 70-80 feet in width. This would mean Galacticas flight decks are at least 200-feet, probably closer to 250-300 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in width, roughly the same a Gerald Ford class aircraft carrier.|$|R
60|$|There {{were three}} or four men in morions behind Don Miguel, and Lord Julian {{realized}} the position. He released his hilt, {{and a couple of}} <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of steel slid softly back into the scabbard. But Don Miguel smiled, with a flash of white teeth behind his grizzled beard, and held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|At a {{distance}} of some five {{hundred yards from the}} river's bank rose a sheer precipice of granite, two hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in height, which had no doubt once formed the bank itself -- the intermediate space of land now utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining, and deepening and embanking the stream.|$|R
