25|$|The first {{inclusive}} tour charter at Vigra {{was carried out}} by Stjernereiser in June 1977, contracting a Sud Aviation Caravelle from Transeuropa to Palma de Mallorca. The short runway meant that the aircraft could not take a full tank of fuel and therefore stopped in Stavanger to refuel. Vigra saw a limited amount of charter, largely since all flight had to have an <b>intermediate</b> <b>landing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aeroflot Flight 3352 was a Tupolev Tu-154 airline flight on a {{domestic}} route from Krasnodar to Novosibirsk, with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>landing</b> in Omsk. While landing at Omsk Airport on Thursday, 11 October 1984, the aircraft crashed into maintenance {{vehicles on the}} runway, killing 174 people on board and 4 on the ground. While a chain of mistakes in airport operations contributed to the accident, its major cause was an air traffic controller falling asleep on duty. As of 2015, this remains the deadliest aviation accident on Russian territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} left Australia in May {{to participate}} in the Borneo Campaign. The advance echelon embarked on ships bound for Morotai on 11 May and arrived there on the 22nd of that month. A further echelon embarked for Labuan on 5 June. While No. 93 Squadron's ground party was established at Labuan shortly after 13 June, the aircraft could not be brought forward due to either the <b>intermediate</b> <b>landing</b> ground at Tarakan being unserviceable or Labuan's airstrip needing to be extended. As a result, while No. 93 Squadron was originally intended to be operational at Labuan from 25 July as part of No. 86 Wing, its first two aircraft did not arrive there until 23 July. The remainder of the squadron departed from Kingaroy on 31 July and arrived at Labuan on 5 August.|$|E

25|$|Norwegian won {{the tender}} for {{military}} {{air transport services}} from 2008, resulting in the airline commencing flights from Bardufoss to Oslo, with SAS terminating the service. Norwegian issued a tender for ground handling, which resulted in Røros Flyservice winning ahead of the incumbent SAS Ground Services. This resulted in a court case which deemed the action conveyance and forced Røros Flyservice to pay the same wage as in SAS. Røros Flyservice spun operation into the subsidiary Bardufoss Flyservice, which ultimately went bankrupt. SAS operated a summer route from Bardufoss to Oslo each summer from 2010 to 2012. Norwegian started with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>landing</b> in Bodø {{on one of their}} daily Oslo flights from 2011. The Ministry of Defence decided in January 2012 to build a new fire station.

A fundamental distinction with the existing literature lies {{in the nature of}} inequality under consideration. We investigate how land inequality across landlords only influences the intensity of the fight against a rebel group comprised of landless individuals. We show that conflict intensity is non-monotonic in land inequality. In particular, the most severe conflicts occur for <b>intermediate</b> <b>land</b> inequality levels. Moreover, a Pareto improving—and thus voluntary—transfer of land from the smaller to the larger landlord may exist. Conflict - Land redistribution - Inequality;...|$|R

2500|$|The basis {{was that}} Stavanger Airport, Sola on the Norwegian West Coast {{was to be}} the hub. The {{delegation}} hoped to procure a Boeing 314, giving a capacity for 20 passengers and [...] of freight. One <b>intermediate</b> <b>landing,</b> planned at Botwood in Newfoundland, was needed before reaching New York. The trip was planned to take 26 and a half hours, comparing to the 13 days it took the delegation to reach Washington, D.C. Preparatory meetings with the Scandinavian ambassadors started on 26 January, followed by two months of negotiations with American authorities, manufacturers, airlines and airports, to insure rights to all aspects of the operations, including training of crew, insurance, agreements with the United States Postal Service, choice of route, weather services and schedules. The neutral American authorities were interested in establishing a route to the then-neutral Scandinavian countries, and the negotiations went well, with all necessary permissions and contracts gained. Pan Am and Juan Trippe set as a condition that the four countries establish a single consortium to function as Pan Am's counter-party. It was decided that Aerotransport initially would function as the counter-party.|$|E

Drought tolerance has been evaluated by the 13 C discrimination method in six land races of emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum SCHRANK), compared with land races, obsolete cultivars and modern varieties of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results of a two-year trial show {{that most of the}} genetic resources of emmer wheat, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>land</b> races of wheat are predisposed to drought tolerance. These varieties respond to dry conditions more sensitively, as they close their pores earlier (a lower value of the discrimination of 13 C isotope).

While climate {{and land use}} are external forcing, wildfire is an integral component of ecosystem functioning which inevitably {{poses a threat to}} humans. With a view to gaining an insight into the mechanisms underlying fire dynamics, fire control, and prevention, we formulated a model that predicts the wildfire regime in fire-prone Mediterranean ecoregions. The model is based on the positive feedback between forest expansion following cropland abandonment, fuel abundance, and fire. Our results demonstrate that progressive land abandonment leads to different fire dynamics in the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. Starting at a no-fire regime when the land is almost completely cultivated, the ecosystem reaches a chaotic fire regime, passing through <b>intermediate</b> <b>land</b> development stages characterized by limit cycle fire dynamics. Wildfires are more devastating, albeit more predictable, in these intermediate stages when fire frequency is higher...|$|R
