In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a <b>joint-venture</b> <b>agreement</b> with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{the resort}} at Baja Mar was {{developed}} in 1975 by Grupo Valcas, a resort developer. Planning, development and initial construction of {{what would become the}} Bajamar Ocean Front Golf Resort was begun by Grupo Valcas as well. The master infrastructure of the community was developed so that, unlike nearby cities, it would maintain underground basic utilities. The resort company also developed the first 18 holes of the master planned golf course network. The resort opened to the general public in July 1976 and has since been given the nickname of The Pebble Beach South of the Border. Further development of the resort occurred in 1991 when the original developer entered a partnership with another hotel and resort developer to complete the master planned property.

40|$|Many {{partnership}} contracts (and other <b>joint-venture</b> <b>agreements)</b> include so-called ?Texas Shootout Clauses? {{to govern}} future breakups. In a Texas Shootout, one partner names a single buy-sell {{price and the}} other partner has the option {{to buy or sell}} at that price. While the prior literature has considered the allocative efficiency of the Texas Shootout, this paper focuses on the incentives of private parties to make these offers to begin with. We consider a model where sole ownership is more efficient than joint ownership. Although both partners are equally capable, one has private information about the common value of the asset. When given the choice, they avoid making buy-sell offers because these offers give away bargaining surplus (the partners are "gun shy"). Instead, they often (but not always) prefer to make simple offers to buy or simple offers to sell and bargaining failures arise. Texas Shootout contracts that assign trigger rights 2 ̆ 013 where one party can force the other to name a price 2 ̆ 013 increase efficiency and are jointly desirable...|$|R
40|$|Imports of {{tractors}} and other farm machinery {{have become increasingly}} important to the U. S. farm machinery industry. Aggregate imports increased from approximately $ 100 million in 1970 to $ 950 million in 1980, with {{tractors and}} harvesting machinery accounting for the largest share of this total. - From 1982 to 1983, the U. S. machinery trade balance for tractors and harvesters shifted from a positive $ 278 million to a deficit of $ 93 million. Imports of tractors and harvesting machinery totalling $ 150 million from Japan and $ 185 million from the Federal Republic of Germany significantly contributed to the trade deficit in 1983. [...] The growth in foreign penetration into the U. S. machinery market has been 3 /achieved with little resistance from U. S. manufacturers. - Increasing farm sizes {{during the past two}} decades have prompted U. S. manufacturers to target 4 /their efforts toward large machinery production. - As the demand for small tractors expanded during the 1970 's, Japan willing entered the U. S. market to fill the void. These imports are sold both under the labels of foreign manufac-turers, and under the labels of U. S. firms through <b>joint-venture</b> <b>agreements.</b> In 1983, all tractors less than 40 h. p. on the U. S market were produced abroad. * Data for 1970 imports of harvesting machinery is not available, so this figure is estimated by assuming these imports constitute roughly 25 % of the annual total imports...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 West Coast fruit cooperatives working {{together}} in joint-venture trading companies may well lower {{the prices of}} their fruit for export through economies of scale. However, present and future foreign demand for American fruit may constrain any economies of scale that are realized in <b>joint-venture</b> <b>agreements.</b> The major objective of this thesis is to analyze the import demand for fresh American oranges, apples, and grapes of one important buying area, Hong Kong. Two theoretical constructs are used to model the import demand for American oranges, apples, and grapes in Hong Kong. One relies on more traditional assumptions of product homogeneity. The other utilizes the Strotzian utility tree. The resulting models are estimated using Ordinary Least Squares. Four conclusions may {{be drawn from the}} estimated models. First, Hong Kong consumers have very elastic responses to changes in the prices of American oranges, apples, and grapes relative to the prices of oranges, apples, and grapes from other sources. Second, this result is especially true when below average demand conditions prevail. Hence, lower prices realized through joint-venture trading companies increase the competitiveness of American fruit at these weaker times. Third, the per capita quantity demanded of American oranges, apples, and grapes will increase as the incomes of Hong Kong's inhabitants rise. Fourth, the statistical problems encountered in the larger models preclude any definite conclusions regarding the price effects of other fruit on the demand for American oranges, apples, and grapes or the price effects which the American fruit may have on each other...|$|R
