This paper presents the results of a comparative investigation of four spatial disaggregation methodologies to determine their relative accuracies. These methodologies include binary dasymetric, a regression model, a locally fitted regression model and threeclass dasymetric, each of which provides different solutions for explaining spatially heterogeneous density when population data is spatially disaggregated. In contrast to previous studies, we apply the spatial disaggregation techniques to a comparably larger and more varied geographical area which allows the spatial disaggregation techniques to be more rigorously tested.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{presents a}} new “intelligent ” <b>dasymetric</b> mapping <b>technique</b> (IDM), which combines an analyst’s domain knowledge with a data-driven methodology {{to specify the}} functional relationship of the ancillary classes with the underlying statistical surface being mapped.

A summary statistics table characterizing the resulting dasymetric map {{can be used to}} compare the quality of the output of different IDM parameterizations. A case study of four population variables is used to demonstrate IDM and provide a visual and quantitative error assessment comparing various IDM parameterizations with areal weighting and conventional “binary ” dasymetric mapping.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of socio-economic data often implies {{the combination of}} data bases originating from different administrative sources so that data have been collected on several separate partitions of the zone of interest into administrative units.

We propose {{a review of the literature}} on statistical methods of spatial reallocation rules (spatial interpolation). Indeed one can distinguish several types of reallocation depending on whether the initial data and the final output are areal data or point data. We concentrate here on the areal-to-areal change of support case when initial and final data have an areal support with a particular attention to disaggregation for continuous data.

40|$|Population {{figures are}} usually {{collected}} by national statistical institutes at small enumeration units (e. g. census tracts or building units). However, still for {{many countries in}} Europe, data are distributed at coarser geographical units like municipalities. This level of resolution is insufficient for analysis in many fields. In addition, the heterogeneity {{of the size of}} the geographical units causes great distortions in analysis, i. e. the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) (Openshaw 1984). <b>Dasymetric</b> mapping <b>techniques</b> have long been applied world-wide to derive finer (and MAUP-free) depictions of the population distribution. These techniques disaggregate population figures reported at coarse source zones into a finer set of zones using ancillary geographical data.

In this article we test new geographical datasets to produce an updated and improved European population grid map. It is tested whether using more detailed ancillary data in the dasymetric mapping significantly yields higher accuracies.

40|$|Reducing {{exposure}} to degraded air quality {{is essential for}} building healthy cities. Although air quality and population vary at fine spatial scales, current regulatory and public health frameworks assess human exposures using county- or city-scales. We build on a spatial analysis <b>technique,</b> <b>dasymetric</b> mapping, for allocating urban populations that, together with emerging fine-scale measurements of air pollution, addresses three objectives: (1) evaluate the role of spatial scale in estimating exposure; (2) identify urban communities that are disproportionately burdened by poor air quality; and (3) estimate reduction in mobile sources of pollutants due to local tree-planting efforts using nitrogen dioxide. Our results show a maximum value of 197 % difference between cadastrally-informed dasymetric system (CIDS) and standard estimations of population {{exposure to}} degraded air quality for small spatial extent analyses, {{and a lack of}} substantial difference for large spatial extent analyses.

Inconsistent and inclusive results from existing studies on air pollution and stroke justify the need to continue to investigate the linkage between stroke and air pollution. No studies have been done to investigate the association between stroke and greenness. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine if there is association of stroke with air pollution, income and greenness in northwest Florida. Results Our study used an ecological geographical approach and <b>dasymetric</b> mapping <b>technique.</b> We adopted a Bayesian hierarchical model with a convolution prior considering five census tract specific covariates. A 95 % credible set which defines an interval having a 0. 95 posterior probability of containing the parameter for each covariate was calculated from Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The 95 % credible sets are (- 0. 286, - 0. 097) for household income, (0. 034, 0. 144) for traffic air pollution effect, (0. 419, 1. 495) for emission density of monitored point source polluters, (0. 413, 1. 522) for simple point density of point source polluters without emission data, and (- 0. 289,- 0. 031) for greenness. Household income and greenness show negative effects (the posterior densities primarily cover negative values). Air pollution covariates have positive effects (the 95 % credible sets cover positive values). Conclusion High risk of stroke mortality was found in areas with low income level, high air pollution level, and low level of exposure to green space. </p...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of future population and employment has become a focus of recent academic enquiry and planning policy concerns. This is largely driven by the rapid urban expansion in major Australian cities {{and the need to}} plan ahead for new housing growth and demand for urban infrastructure and services. At a national level forecasts for population and employment are produced by the government and research institutions; however there is a further need to break these forecasts down to a disaggregate geographic scale for growth management within regions. Appropriate planning for the urban growth needs forecasts for fine-grained spatial units. This thesis has developed methodologies to predict the future settlement of the population, employment and urban form by applying a spatial disaggregation approach. The methodology uses the existing regional forecasts reported at regional geographic units and applies a novel spatially-based technique to step-down the regional forecasts to smaller geographical units. South East Queensland (SEQ) is the experimental context for the methodologies developed in the thesis, being one of the fastest-growing metropolitan regions in Australia. The research examines whether spatial disaggregation methodologies {{that can be used to}} enhance the forecasts for urban planning purposes and to derive a deeper understanding of the urban spatial structure under growth conditions. The first part of this thesis develops a method by which the SEQ population forecasts can be spatially disaggregated. This is related to a classical problem in geographical analysis called to modifiable area unit problem, where spatial data disaggregation may give inaccurate results due to spatial heterogeneity in the explanatory variables. Several statistical regression and <b>dasymetric</b> <b>techniques</b> are evaluated to spatially disaggregate population forecasts over the study area and to assess their relative accuracies. An important contribution arising from this research is that: i) it extends the dasymetric method beyond its current simple form to techniques that incorporate more complex density assumptions to disaggregate the data and, ii) it selects a method based on balancing the costs and errors of the disaggregation for a study area. The outputs of the method are spatially disaggregated population forecasts across the smaller areas that can be directly used for urban form analysis and are also directly available for subsequent employment disaggregation. The second part in this thesis develops a method to spatially disaggregate the employment forecasts and examine their impact on the urban form. A new method for spatially disaggregating the employment data is evaluated; it analyses the trend and spatial pattern of historic regional employment patterns based on employment determinants (for example, the local population and the proximity of an area to a shopping centre). The method we apply, namely geographically weighted regression (GWR), accounts for spatial effects of data autocorrelation and heterogeneity. Autocorrelation is where certain variables for employment determinants are related in space, and hence violate traditional statistical independence assumptions, and heterogeneity is where the associations between variables change across space. The method uses a locally-fitted relationship to estimate employment in the smaller geography whilst being constrained by the regional forecast. Results show that, by accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the local dependency of employment, the GWR method generates superior estimates over a global regression model. The spatially disaggregate projections developed in this thesis can be used to better understand questions on urban form. From a planning perspective, the results of spatial disaggregation indicate that the future growth of the population for SEQ is likely to maintain a spatially-dispersed growth pattern, whilst the employment is likely to follow a more polycentric distribution focused around the new activity centres. Overall, the thesis demonstrates that the spatial disaggregation method can be applied to supplement the regional forecasts to seek a deeper understanding of the future urban growth patterns. The development, application and validation of the spatial disaggregation methods will enhance the planner’s toolbox whilst responding to the data issues to inform urban planning and future development in a region...|$|R
40|$|While {{environmental}} justice (EJ) {{research in the}} U. S. has traditionally focused on inequities {{in the distribution of}} technological hazards, the disproportionate impacts of Hurricane Katrina on racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged households have prompted researchers to investigate the EJ implications of natural hazards such as flooding. Recent EJ research has also emphasized the need to examine social inequities in access to environmental amenities. Unlike technological hazards such as air pollution and toxic waste sites, areas exposed to natural hazards such as hurricanes and floods have indivisible amenities associated with them. Coastal property owners are exposed to flood hazards, but also enjoy water views and unhampered access to oceans and the unique recreational opportunities that beaches offer. Conversely, dense urban development and associated impervious surfaces increase likelihood of floods in inland areas which may lack the amenities of proximity to open water. This dissertation contributes to the emerging literature on EJ and social vulnerability to natural hazards by analyzing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities in the distribution of flood risk exposure in the Miami Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Florida [...] one of the most hurricane-prone areas in the world {{and one of the most}} ethnically diverse MSAs in the U. S. The case study evaluates the EJ implications of residential exposure to coastal flood risk, inland flood risk, and no flood risk, in conjunction with coastal water related amenities, using geographic information science (GIS) -based techniques and logistic regression modeling to estimate flood risk exposure. Geospatial data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are utilized to delineate coastal and inland 100 -year flood hazard zones. Socio-demographic variables previously utilized in EJ research are obtained from tract level data published in the 2010 census and 2007 - 2011 American Community Survey five-year estimates. Principal components analysis is employed to condense several socio-demographic attributes into two neighborhood deprivation indices that represent economic insecurity and instability, respectively. Indivisible coastal water related amenities are represented by control variables of percent seasonal homes and proximity to public beach access sites. Results indicate that racial/ethnic minorities and those with greater social vulnerability based on the neighborhood deprivation indices are more likely to reside in inland flood zones and areas outside 100 -year flood zones, while residents in coastal flood zones are disproportionately non-Hispanic White. Moreover, residents exposed to coastal flood risk tend to live in areas with ample coastal water related amenities, while racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with higher neighborhood deprivation who are exposed to inland flood risk or no flood risk reside in areas without coastal water related amenities. This dissertation elucidates the importance of EJ research on privilege and access to environmental amenities in conjunction with environmental hazards because areas exposed to natural hazards are likely to offer indivisible benefits. Estimating people and places exposed to hazards for EJ research becomes difficult when the boundaries of census areal units containing socio-demographic data do not match the boundaries of hazard exposure areas. This challenge is addressed with an application of dasymetric spatial interpolation using GIS-based techniques to disaggregate census tracts to inhabited parcels. Several spatial interpolation methods are assessed for relative accuracy in estimating population densities for the Miami MSA, and the output units from the most accurate method are employed in EJ regression analyses. The dasymetric mapping efforts utilized herein contribute to research on the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and its effects on statistical analyses. Since the <b>dasymetric</b> mapping <b>technique</b> used for EJ analyses disaggregates census tracts to the inhabited parcel level, the results of the associated analyses for flood hazards exposure and access to coastal water related amenities should be more reliable than those based on tracts. The enhanced accuracy associated with inhabited parcels is a result of using a more precise geospatial depiction of residential populations, which leads to a more accurate portrayal of disproportionate exposure to flood hazards. Consequently, this dissertation contributes methodologically to GIS-based <b>techniques</b> of <b>dasymetric</b> spatial interpolation and empirically to EJ analysis of flood hazards with indivisible coastal water related amenities...|$|R
