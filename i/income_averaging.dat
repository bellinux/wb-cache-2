He hit upon a scheme to access the <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> provisions of division 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA). <b>Income</b> <b>averaging</b> allowed a taxpayer to spread income over multiple tax years and was meant for primary producers (farmers etc.) with highly variable incomes.

50|$|Cridland v Federal Commissioner of Taxation was a 1977 High Court of Australia case {{concerning}} a novel tax scheme whereby some 5,000 university students became primary producers (as in farmers) for tax purposes, allowing them certain <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> benefits.

50|$|In some {{countries}} a married person or couple benefits from various taxation advantages {{not available to}} a single person. For example, spouses may be allowed to average their combined incomes. This is advantageous to a married couple with disparate incomes. To compensate for this, countries may provide a higher tax bracket for the averaged income of a married couple. While <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> might still benefit a married couple with a stay-at-home spouse, such averaging would cause a married couple with roughly equal personal incomes to pay more total tax than they would as two single persons.

The butter was sent via a daily milk train which departed Swanbourne each morning at 0830 also carrying supplies brought to the station by cart from local farms. The Rothschilds used to send horses by rail to Swanbourne for a day's hunting with the Whaddon Chase.Although receipts had declined by the 1930s, the station remained prosperous until after the Second World War.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the {{dominant}} norm in fundamental tax reform has shifted from income taxation to consumption taxation, among academics no less than policymakers.

Likewise, few have recognized that the grounds for unease about the case for <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> (as an ideal system, leaving aside administrative concerns) apply equally to the case for consumption taxation. Within a welfare economics framework, the case for both norms is close to irrefutable if one makes three key assumptions: that markets are complete, that individuals engage in consistent rational choice given their preferences, and that the only relevant information about taxpayer “ability’ is that provided by an undifferentiated measure of lifetime earnings. Where these assumptions fail to hold, (1) allowing <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> between periods may be undesirable, (2) the case for a consumption tax becomes less clearcut, and (3) as revealed by the “new dynamic public finance” literature in economics, there may actually be a strong rationale for taxing saving...|$|E

40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA 86) {{repealed}} <b>income</b> <b>averaging</b> {{under the}} assumption that the lower and wider tax brackets of the new law would prevent taxpayers with volatile incomes from suffering tax inequities. This study objectively tests this assumption. ^ Simulations are conducted, with the use of IRS panel data tapes, to measure the magnitude of the tax inequities at ten different Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) levels under the TRA 86. Regression analysis and descriptive statistics are used to determine factors associated with tax inequities from fluctuating incomes. A Delphi survey is undertaken using nationally recognized tax policy experts, to determine if the inequities found in the simulations justify the costs of reintroducing <b>income</b> <b>averaging.</b> The tax policy experts use a macro perspective, not an individual taxpayer perspective, to determine a point at which inequities from volatile incomes are large enough to warrant the reintroduction of <b>income</b> <b>averaging.</b> ^ The simulation discovered that in every AGI level at least 25 percent of the population suffers inequities. Classifying the taxpayers by AGI, then ranking the taxpayers from the smallest to the largest inequity, the median annual inequity for the top 10 percent of each AGI ranges from 270 to 4, 830.
