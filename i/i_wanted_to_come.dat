But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me." ...|$|E
500|$|American author Jennifer Roberson {{was known}} for writing fantasy novels before she moved into {{historical}} fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, [...] "One thing I'd always wanted to try–another ‘someday’ dream– was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic." [...] She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend {{from the perspective of}} Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a [...] "recounting" [...] of the original story, because [...] "there is none"; rather, Lady of the Forest was [...] "purely [...] own concoction." [...] Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, [...] "I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, the key was logic—I interwove historical fact with the fantasy of the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{describe}} the couple as intimate lesbian partners, citing {{as an example}} Bates' 1891 letter to Coman: [...] "It was never very possible to leave Wellesley good, because so many love-anchors held me there, and it seemed least of all possible when I had just found the long-desired way to your dearest heart...Of course <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you, very much as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Heaven." [...] Others contest {{the use of the}} term lesbian to describe such a [...] "Boston marriage". Writes one: [...] "We cannot say with certainty what sexual connotations these relationships conveyed. We do know that these relationships were deeply intellectual; they fostered verbal and physical expressions of love." ...|$|R

[...] Hinojosa's bilingual set included {{her version of}} Guthrie's [...] "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" [...] in Spanish. In an interview with The Oklahoman, Hinojosa said: [...] "Of course, it’s wonderful. For me to come solo is how <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> because something like a festival celebrating Woody Guthrie to me is about the lyrics and the stories. [...] I was doing it Woody’s way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
