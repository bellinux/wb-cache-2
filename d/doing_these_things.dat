He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
25|$|The critic Diana Postlethwaite {{wrote of}} this period for Martineau: Being homebound is {{a major part of}} the process of {{becoming}} feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> They define femininity for her.Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.|$|E
25|$|All {{evidence}} {{indicated that}} crew error {{was in no}} way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter, and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble. Although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats, <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> would have added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds.|$|E

25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E
25|$|For juries {{to fulfill}} their role of {{analyzing}} {{the facts of the}} case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from media or the internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a crime scene). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. <b>Doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> may constitute reversible error. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury sequestered for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.|$|E

For me, I have a lot of ideas and sometimes it just comes down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010, General Richards {{said there}} was no desire to [...] "open up another front" [...] in the Middle East but {{suggested}} that in future it [...] "might be" [...] necessary. David Cameron told Parliament that Britain would [...] "take every step to cut out the terrorist cancer that lurks in the Arabian Peninsula", but Gen Richards said an intelligence-led approach was the current strategy. Richards added: [...] "Clearly, the primary agencies dealing with this are our intelligence and security agencies. But the military are already helping with their [...] training. I don't think we want to open up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment. Our role is to remain very close to them, to help them where they most need it and in the meanwhile focus our efforts on Afghanistan and assisting Pakistan to ensure they don't become the threat Yemen is beginning to be.|$|E
