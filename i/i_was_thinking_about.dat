I was picturing one of his movies, {{and one of the}} female characters. I have a whole thing worked out. All Quentin has to do is show up with a camera. I can't afford a director's fee." [...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't really think of myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Post-release, {{the games}} director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, {{contemplated}} adding an easier difficulty level, saying: [...] "Dark Souls is rather difficult {{and a number}} of people may hesitate to play. This fact is really sad to me and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> whether <b>I</b> should prepare another difficulty that everyone can complete or carefully send all gamers the messages behind our difficult games." [...] Namco Bandai claimed Miyazakis statement was mistranslated, and should have read [...] "This fact is really sad to me and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> how to make everyone complete the game while maintaining the current difficulty and carefully send all gamers the messages behind it." ...|$|R

"I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Drew asking Swift, [...] "Hey, are you gonna go to {{the game}} on Friday?" [...] Swift responds, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. Why?" [...] He then admits it was just curiosity, informs Swift about a girl he met, and walks away. The video then transcends to Swift, wearing a long {{aquamarine}} evening gown, lying beside an acoustic guitar on a mattress in a bedroom. She performs the song until the scene transitions to Swift and Drew at the library, where he parodies a novel and she chuckles. The librarian requests for the two to maintain silence, so they converse quietly. Afterwards, Swift is in a chemistry laboratory, where she is mixing substances. Distracted by Drew approaching her, she accidentally pours too much of one substance and causes it to spill. They both rapidly attempt to clean the mess generated. As the song approaches its bridge, Swift and Drew walk towards each other, both smiling, but Drew then kisses his girlfriend, as Swift watches in agony. The video again transcends to the performance scene, where it concludes. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the mattress, crying, and standing beside a fireplace in the bedroom. The video received a nomination for [...] "Number One Streamed Music Video" [...] at the web-hosted 2007 CMT Online Awards, but lost to Sugarland's [...] "Stay" [...] (2007). The video received a nomination for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Tokio Hotel's video for [...] "Ready, Set, Go!" [...] (2007). To date, the video has over 92 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{it struck}} me then," [...] she admitted. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that Lord Arranmore {{could not have been}} the person whom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> It <b>is</b> ridiculous of me to attach so much {{importance}} to a mere likeness." ...|$|R

2500|$|One-time friend Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins wrote {{lyrics to}} the Massive Attack song [...] "Teardrop", {{thinking}} of Buckley's death, stating: [...] "That was so weird ...

And sure enough, by the end of lunch, we'd all signed up to do six hours on plants." ...|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} {{recording}} studio experience for McCready and Vedder. Regarding McCready, Cornell said, [...] "You almost kind of had to yell at him {{to get him to}} realize that in the five-and-a-half minute solo of 'Reach Down', that was his time and that he wasn't going to be stepping on anybody else." [...] The song [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said [...] "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> doing it, just instinctively".|$|E

2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This could be my final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when I started. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> my regeneration scene from the outset, that’s my terrible melancholic nature, when you accept the job you know there’ll come a day, inevitably, when you’ll be saying goodbye.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pierre {{has since}} looked back on Go with mixed emotions; he later cited {{it as his}} {{personal}} least favorite album by the band. He remembered the band were [...] "burnt out and miserable" [...] while recording, noting that drummer Thaxton left the band a year later due to depression. He personally was struggling with dark thoughts as well: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> death a lot and {{had a lot of}} back pain and was grumpy and it was winter. [...] A {{lot of people who were}} close to me died around that time and I just felt this strange floating sensation like I was sleepwalking through life. It wasn't bad or good, it was just weird and I feel like that somehow translated to that record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Bob and Sara Dylan {{sold their}} Woodstock home and {{purchased}} a modest property on the Point Dume peninsula, north of Malibu, California. They commenced constructing a large home on this site, {{and the subsequent}} re-modelling of the house occupied the next two years. Sounes writes that during this period, tensions {{began to appear in}} their marriage. The Dylans still retained a house in Manhattan. In April 1974, Dylan began to take art classes with artist Norman Raeben in New York. Dylan would later say in an interview that the art lessons caused problems in his marriage: [...] "I went home after that first day and my wife never did understand me ever since that day. That's when our marriage started breaking up. She never knew what I was talking about, what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about,</b> and I couldn't possibly explain it." ...|$|E

Everybody <b>is</b> going ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> death all the time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zuckerberg {{founded the}} Start-up: Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, [...] "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate." [...] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2015, {{the song}} [...] "Help Is Coming" [...] from the Afterglow album, was {{released}} as a download and limited edition 7" [...] single {{to raise money}} for the charity Save the Children. The B-side, [...] "Anthem", was a previously unreleased track that was initially recorded in 1995, with the final vocal added in 2015. [...] The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of [...] "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families.
