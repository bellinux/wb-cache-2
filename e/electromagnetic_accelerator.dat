5000|$|Estimates of {{the cost}} per unit mass of {{launching}} cargo or people from the Moon vary and the cost impacts of future technological improvements are difficult to predict. An upper bound {{on the cost of}} launching material from the Moon might be about $40,000,000 per kilogram, based on dividing the Apollo program costs by the amount of material returned. At the other extreme, the incremental cost of launching material from the Moon using an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerator</b> could be quite low. The efficiency of launching material from the Moon with a proposed electric accelerator is suggested to be about 50%. If the carriage of a mass driver weighs the same as the cargo, two kilograms must be accelerated to orbital velocity for each kilogram put into orbit. The overall system efficiency would then drop to 25%. So 1.4 kilowatt-hours would be needed to launch an incremental kilogram of cargo to low orbit from the Moon. At $0.1/kilowatt-hour, a typical cost for electrical power on Earth, that amounts to $0.16 for the energy to launch a kilogram of cargo into orbit. For the actual cost of an operating system, energy loss for power conditioning, the cost of radiating waste heat, the cost of maintaining all systems, and the interest cost of the capital investment are considerations.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Augmented <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerators</b> are advanced mass accelerators {{which are}} using an additional magnetic field {{to support the}} launching process. In conventional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerators</b> the electrical current through the rails and the armature {{has to be very}} large in order to achieve a sufficiently high electromagnetic force which accelerates the projectile. Due to magnetic flux diffusion effects, the electrical current is concentrated {{on the back of the}} armature, resulting in high current concentration and therefore heat generation. Together with the sliding contact between the armature and the rails, abrasive wear of the materials can occur and cause a transition from the solid contact to a plasma contact, which further increases the temperature and the wear of the rail/armature interface. To decrease the electrical current through the armature without decreasing the accelerating force on the projectile, an additional energy input mechanism has to be implemented, realized by an additional magnetic field, augmenting the magnetic field generated by the current through the main rails.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of current sheet canting in pulsed <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerators</b> is {{the departure of}} the plasma sheet (that carries the current) from a plane that is perpendicular to the electrodes to one that is skewed (or tipped), which negatively impacts accelerator efciency. In the present study, it is postulated that depletion of plasma near the anode, which results from axial density gradient induced diamagnetic drift, occurs during {{the early stages of the}} discharge, creating a density gradient normal to the anode, with a characteristic length on the order of the ion skin depth. Rapid penetration of the magnetic eld through this region ensues, due to the Hall effect, leading to a canted current front ahead of the initial current con-duction channel. Once the current sheet reaches appreciable speeds, entrainment of stationary propellant replenishes plasma in the anode region, inhibiting further Hall-convective transport of the magnetic eld; however, the previously established tilted current sheet continues to drive plasma toward the cathode and accumulate it there. This proposed sequence of events has been incorporated into a phenomenological model. The model predicts that canting can be reduced by using low atomic mass propellants with high propellant loading number density; the model results are shown to give good agreement with experimen-tally measured canting angle mass dependence trends...|$|R

The measured critical wave parameters are in excellent agreement with theoretical instability boundary predictions. The instability is current driven and affects {{a wide spectrum of}} longitudinal (electrostatic) oscillations. Current driven instabilities, which are intrinsic to the high-current-carrying magnetized plasma of the magnetoplasmadynmic (MPD) accelerator, were investigated with a kinetic theoretical model based on first principles. Analytical limits of the appropriate dispersion relation yield unstable ion acoustic waves for T(i) /T(e) much less than 1 and electron acoustic waves for T(i) /T(e) much greater than 1. The resulting set of nonlinear equations for the case of T(i) /T(e) = 1, of most interest to the MPD thruster Plasma Wave Experiment, was numerically solved to yield a multiparameter set of stability boundaries. Under certain conditions, marginally stable waves traveling almost perpendicular to the magnetic field would travel at a velocity equal to that of the electron current. Such waves were termed current waves. Unstable current waves near the upper stability boundary were observed experimentally and are in accordance with theoretical predictions.

Therefore, several technological approaches among them laser driven particle acceleration are under investigation. Parallel {{to the development of}} suitable high intensity lasers, research is necessary to transfer laser accelerated particle beams to radiotherapy, since the relevant parameters of laser driven particle beams dramatically differ from those of beams delivered by conventional accelerators: The duty cycle is low, whereas the number of particles and thus the dose rate per pulse are high.

The study presents and discusses {{the state of the art}} of these systems, comparing their properties and commenting their possibilities and limitations by near future potential applications. In a long prospective, the magnetic levitation launch-assist system could be a solution for aircraft like operations for heavy payloads measured in Mg with subsonic velocities up 200 m/s at about 1 G, while for low Earth orbit LEO start of launch packages with weight in the range between 100 kg and 2000 kg a suitable solution could be coil accelerator.

40|$|A {{detailed}} experimental {{characterization of}} current sheet evolution in a pulsed <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerator</b> is presented based on temporally and spatially resolved {{measurements of the}} magnetic field in the device. The dynamics of current sheets generally depart from the ideal snowplow dynamics and are consequently associated with various non-idealities. Magnetic probes (B-dot probes) were used at 432 spatial loca-tions in the device to obtain {{a description of the}} magnetic field evolution. The corresponding current sheet evolution was ab-stracted from the magnetic field data and shows a complex structure of the current sheet during the initial part of its evolution. The measurements show the current sheet evolves from a sheet perpendicular to the electrodes to a structure exhibiting a main trunk and a canted branch near the anode. The canted branch evolves into a final canted current sheet front, short circuiting the trunk and leaving it behind in its wake. These observed features are in good agreement with the phenomenological description derived previously from a photographic survey of the discharge. The magnetic field measurements compliment the previous photographic survey as the latter indicates the location of the discharge (through filtered ion emission) but cannot show directly where the cur-rent sheet is located.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{reflections}} undertaken {{about a possible}} space-launch project {{on the basis of}} the use of electromagnetic launch technology. It is assumed that the direct access to space is not possible using a single-stage system only, since for such a system muzzle velocities of approx. 10 km/s are required. Therefore, combined electrical-chemical multistage systems are considered. Multi-stage chemical rockets have been realized for LEO (Low earth Orbit) projects but it turned out that they are rather ineffective. For example, modern vertically launched rocket carrier burns more than one third of its propellant up to altitude of 15 km. In contrast, the injection of small payloads in LEO by means of propelled vehicles (e. g. rockets) which are launched from <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>accelerators</b> is a concept that probably enables the access to space at reduced cost. Such a solution has serious consequences for all stages, in particular for the accelerator and payload carrier design. The paper is divided into two parts. First, some general aspects (size, forces, energy and power) of an electromagnetic launcher, which could be able to achieve the required muzzle momentum for such a mission, are discussed. More specifically, the design of such a launcher with respect to the type of <b>electromagnetic</b> Lorentz Rail <b>Accelerators</b> (known also as railgun) and to the armature technology is considered and also some of the inter-stage aspects of such a system are investigated. Special attention is paid to solutions increasing the launch efficiency of the electromagnetic launcher. The second part of the paper considers details of the rocket stages. The propelled payload carrier with very high initial velocity is exposed to harsh aerothermal loads during the ascent flight through the dense atmosphere. The analysis shows that a ground-based <b>electromagnetic</b> Lorentz rail <b>accelerator</b> (LRA) is limited to a start velocity of about 4. 5 km/sec if the present state of technology is considered. At higher velocities the payload carrier will be destroyed due to the extreme heat loads. In the paper possible solutions for aerothermal protection, based on passive Thermal Protection Systems (TPS), effusion and film cooling, ablation or their combinations are analyzed and discussed. Also, the shape of the projectile has to be optimized to reduce the aerodynamic drag and to enable static stability. Some solutions to achieve this goal are here suggested. Concerning possible trajectories for such mission, a feasibility study is performed. It indicates that the injection orbit or payload mass can be increased if the initial velocity is kept constant as 4. 5 km/sec. Examples of such calculations for a two-stage LEO launcher are shown: the initial flight path angle the and velocity, the thrust profile of engines for both (booster and kick–off) stages influence the trajectory profile and payload mass. ...|$|R
