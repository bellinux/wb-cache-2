5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was hired to do the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood {{interest}} in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued {{the idea of}} developing an [...] "American" [...] version unrelated to the Swedish film adaptation released that year. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony. Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, [...] "They sent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'We want to do this. [...] We will {{think of it as}} one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'" [...] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} The Mikado, Bond met Lewis Ransome, a young civil {{engineer}} from a wealthy Quaker family. [...] He {{had just returned from}} America, and the two compared travel experiences. Ransome admitted to Bond that, after watching The Mikado, he had mentioned to his sister that he [...] "liked the little one with the big sash best. So next day when she saw a photograph of you in a shop window she went in and bought it. She gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I have it now." [...] Thus, despite Bond's aversion to romance, began a long friendship that led, twelve years later, to Bond's second marriage. Ransome, several years younger than Bond, proposed marriage on many occasions {{over the course of the}} relationship, but Bond told him that she would not marry while she continued on the stage. Over the years, the two spent many of Bond's days off (Sundays) relaxing together in the country.|$|E

500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1178, {{five or more}} monks from Canterbury {{reported}} an upheaval on the Moon shortly after sunset. [...] "There was a bright new moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted toward the east; and suddenly the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of this division a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out, over a considerable distance, fire, hot coals, and sparks. Meanwhile {{the body of the}} moon which was below writhed, as it were, in anxiety, and, {{to put it in the}} words of those who reported <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> saw it with their own eyes, the moon throbbed like a wounded snake. Afterwards it resumed its proper state. This phenomenon was repeated a dozen times or more, the flame assuming various twisting shapes at random and then returning to normal. Then after these transformations the moon from horn to horn, that is along its whole length, took on a blackish appearance." [...] This description appears outlandish perhaps due to lacking public understanding of astronomical phenomena. In 1976, Jack Hartung proposed that this described the formation of the Giordano Bruno crater. However, more recent studies suggest that it appears very unlikely the 1178 event was related to the formation of Crater Giordano Bruno, or was even a true transient lunar phenomenon at all. The millions of tons of lunar debris ejected from an impact large enough to leave a 22-km-wide crater would have resulted in an unprecedentedly intense, week-long meteor storm on Earth. No accounts of such a memorable storm have been found in any known historical records, including several astronomical archives from around the world. In light of this, it is suspected that the group of monks (the event's only known witnesses) saw the atmospheric explosion of a directly oncoming meteor in chance alignment, from their specific vantage point, with the far more distant moon.|$|E
2500|$|Easter Sunday - a heavy gunfight in Belfast left a RUC constable dead, {{with six}} IRA members arrested in Cawnpore Street in response. In Dublin, Irish Special Branch {{attempted}} to arrest Lasarian Mangan and Brendan Behan. [...] When Mangan seemed to hesitate in using his gun, Behan was heard to shout [...] "Use it, use it. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I will shoot the bastards.". Behan was later arrested in Dublin and received fourteen years in prison. The third {{incident in the}} time line involved Frank Morris, who began shooting when detained at a RUC border checkpoint in Strabane. He was captured 10 hours later that day, found hiding, immersed up to his neck in river water.|$|E

2500|$|Although rookie hazing was customary, Cobb {{could not}} endure it in good humor and soon became alienated from his teammates. He later {{attributed}} his hostile temperament to this experience: [...] "These old-timers turned {{me into a}} snarling wildcat." [...] Tigers manager Hughie Jennings later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players, some of whom sought to force him off the team. [...] "I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning", Jennings recalled. [...] "Well, he proved <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I told the other players to let him alone.

2500|$|It {{was then}} that French {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï was introduced by Madonna's partner Guy Oseary.

I just flipped over it and said, 'Please {{find out if he}} wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï spoke little English, and Madonna commented: [...] "The first couple of days we were recording, I wanted to rip my hair out. [...] It didn't seem like there was any way for us to communicate. His manager had to come in and translate everything at first." ...|$|E

[...] Ahmadzaï always preferred taking musical risks and hence he wanted the collaborations with Madonna to get out the best from the artist. [...] "The challenge was to make something current appear, something hidden in her personality. Everybody knows [...] as a chameleon, as a businesswoman. I wanted to show her potential as a musician," [...] Ahmadzaï noted. [...] "Music" [...] features production by Ahmadzaï, who Madonna has called a [...] "genius".|$|E

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
