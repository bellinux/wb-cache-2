25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. <b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, although not without some initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become more comfortable in dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon has serious objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room. Early in season 10, the couple is very happy to be finally living alone after Sheldon moves in with Amy.|$|E

"The meeting {{which took}} place after Easter in 1967 lasted two minutes … I told him in a few words the purpose of my visit: for him to bless the Congregation of the Holy Ghost which was due to hold an {{extraordinary}} General Chapter meeting … Then Padre Pio cried out. 'Me, bless an archbishop, no, no, it is you who should be blessing me!' And he bowed, to receive the blessing.

He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse. <b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> her lifeless lips and declared [...] "For you I lived [...] for you I die." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from their honeymoon, Scott and Charlene {{moved in with}} Madge and Henry, and they struggled financially. Just three months after their wedding, producers decided to throw temptation at the couple to keep their relationship interesting. Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, quipped that [...] "a happy soap couple is considered the kiss of death". Scott {{was the first to}} cheat when <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> Jane Harris (Annie Jones), while she helped him study for his HSC. After Jane confessed to Charlene, she threw Scott out and refused to talk to him. In a bid to reunite the couple, Jane told Charlene that she would steal Scott away from her unless she did something about it. The couple soon reunited. The following year, Charlene had a brief affair with her driving instructor Steve Fisher (Michael Pope).|$|E

500|$|The {{initiation}} {{ceremony for}} newly appointed privy counsellors {{is held in}} private and typically requires kneeling on a stool before the sovereign and then kissing hands. According to The Royal Encyclopaedia: [...] "The new privy counsellor or minister will extend his or her right hand, palm upwards, and, taking the Queen's hand lightly, will kiss it {{with no more than}} a touch of the lips." [...] The ceremony has caused difficulties for privy counsellors who advocate republicanism; Tony Benn said in his diaries that <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> his own thumb, rather than the Queen's hand, while Jeremy Corbyn reportedly did not kneel. Not all members of the privy council go through the initiation ceremony; appointments are frequently made by an Order in Council, although it is [...] "rare for a party leader to use such a course." ...|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{spent most}} of 1946 campaigning in the district, and worked hard to extend his name {{recognition}} beyond his hometown of Whittier. [...] In 1952, as Nixon ran for vice president, the Madera News-Tribune set forth its view of why Nixon beat Voorhis, [...] "He rang doorbells, he talked on street corners and in auditoriums, <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> babies, patted old ladies on the cheek, and otherwise made himself known wherever and whenever two people would stop and listen to him. He made friends with the press and radio, he {{went out of his}} way to be congenial and likable." [...] Bullock indicated that regardless of the tactics used, Nixon would likely have beaten the incumbent given the national Republican tide that swept the party into power in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1931.|$|E
500|$|Anne's masques were {{responsible}} for almost all the courtly female performance {{in the first two}} decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses of 1604, she played Pallas Athena, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in The Masque of Blackness of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as [...] "blackamores". Letter writer Dudley Carleton reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> her hand [...] "though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips". Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song [...] "Then <b>He</b> <b>Kissed</b> Me". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He believed that the line [...] "I'm crazy for you, Touch me once and you'll know it's true" [...] was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation.|$|E
500|$|Spector's records {{backed by}} the Wrecking Crew usually {{featured}} arrangements by Jack Nitzsche. [...] For Spector the unit operated under the name [...] "the Phil Spector Wall of Sound Orchestra" [...] and was an essential component in creating his [...] "Wall of Sound" [...] style starting with [...] "He's a Rebel" [...] {{and a series of}} several more hits by the Crystals ("Da Doo Ron Ron" [...] and [...] "Then <b>He</b> <b>Kissed</b> Me") and other girl groups, such as the Ronettes ("Be My Baby" [...] and [...] "Baby, I Love You"). [...] It was on these recordings that the Wrecking Crew emerged in their most recognizable form and became the most coveted session players in Los Angeles' thriving recording scene. [...] With them, Spector went on to produce other records by the Righteous Brothers ("You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'", [...] "Ebb Tide", and [...] "Unchained Melody") and Ike and Tina Turner ("River Deep – Mountain High").|$|E
500|$|When Theresa [...] "had {{her eye on}} Ste" [...] for a {{potential}} boyfriend, Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail quipped [...] "Given his history of violence towards women, that might be realised more literally than she would like." [...] When <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> Brendan, Stephen said Ste had {{joined the ranks of}} [...] "very confused young men" [...] that have featured in Hollyoaks. She added he had [...] "banged about wanting to be a good boyfriend and dad for aeons" [...] and being the victim of domestic violence was ironic for him. She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence. She opined that Richardson gave an [...] "incredible performance" [...] and felt she was not alone in perceiving the storyline to be [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and [...] "deeply moving". She later expressed her view that [...] "Ste hasn’t experienced much normality in his young life". She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day. The Liverpool Daily Post said [...] "You know you're not flavour of the month when even Ste Hay looks down his nose at you." ...|$|E

500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling his T-shirt business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We all started with good motives, but there was lots of naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E
500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] was {{directed}} by Dean Holland, his third directorial credit after [...] "Greg Pikitis" [...] and [...] "Sweetums". The script read-through and filming took place in March 2010. Rob Lowe's first day of filming took place on his birthday, March 17, which was {{the same day the}} scene where <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> Rashida Jones was shot. The original cut of [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was a full 30 minutes and had to be cut down to 22 minutes for broadcast. The staff of Parks and Recreation had difficulty editing the episode down because the script involved so many interconnected subplots between the characters. Screenwriter Harris Wittels said, [...] "As soon as you'd cut one thing, you had to cut something else because it was tied to another piece." [...] Among the scenes cut were an extended cold open in which Ron gives April a handgun for her 21st birthday, much to the chagrin of Leslie. Also cut was a scene in which Ron chastises Leslie for yelling at Ben at the Snakehole Lounge and orders her to apologize to him so she will not be fired. Instead, the episode was changed to reflect that Leslie decided to apologize to Ben herself, with the line from Leslie [...] "I have to go swallow my pride" [...] added just before she spoke to Ben.|$|E
