60|$|There is, of course, much to deplore in {{the present}} state of affairs--much that is very melancholy. The {{constitution}} is not a model one, and no prospect of even comparative liberty of the Press has been offered. At the same time, I hope still. As tranquillity is established, there will be certain modifications; this, indeed, has been intimated, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>Press</b> will by degrees attain to its emancipation. Meanwhile, the 'Athenæum' and other English papers say wrongly that there is a censure established on books. There is a censure on pamphlets and newspapers--on books, no.

50|$|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I wouldn't go that far. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> corps {{dropped the}} ball at the beginning. When the lead-up to the war began, the press corps was under {{enormous}} pressure from corporate executives, frankly, {{to make sure that}} this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president's high approval ratings.|$|E

"Our {{articles}} poked fun at respected people, challenged long-established {{ideas and}} disproved widely-accepted 'facts' - not because these points were {{especially important in}} themselves but because they got {{people to think about}} queer things in new ways. Ideas come and go, but our beliefs about the bigger picture will always affect how we respond to new ideas in <b>the</b> future. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Stonewall will be a very different organisation in a couple of years, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> gay <b>press</b> will be different and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> London Mardi Gras will be a thing of the past. None of that will be down to Outcast directly, but we've done our bit. We've contributed to the debate, and the debate goes on." ...|$|R
5000|$|I have a theory, {{but it is}} only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, {{who later}} adopted the name Charles Sprague and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the [...] "Financial Times" [...] in London. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in <b>the</b> {{newspaper}} <b>press.</b> It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, I never asked him about this when I got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|In his own Targ Editions volume, Abacus Now, William Targ wrote: [...] "Print {{can be as}} {{beautiful}} as music; it {{has the power to}} move, it is as volatile as stage magic. As a typophile and bookman, now on my own, I look more closely into the genius and works {{of the men and women}} who enriched our lives with beautiful books. I observe closely the contemporary typographic scene, the people engaged with the magical 26 letters by which we live... <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> private <b>press</b> printer will save <b>the</b> world; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that if we are seeking the pure of heart and a wholesome commitment, such a person may be found more readily beside a hand press than, say, in an advertising agency or in the House of Representatives - or in City Hall." [...] William Targ died on July 22, 1999, at the age of 92, in his Manhattan home. He was survived by his wife, Roslyn, of Manhattan, a literary agent; a son, Russell, of Palo Alto, California; two grandchildren, one of whom is Elisabeth Targ, and four great-grandchildren.|$|R
5000|$|Each episode {{begins with}} a cold opening showing one or both {{brothers}} {{in the middle of}} some activity, typically involving something imaginary. After greeting the audience, David introduces [...] "The Remote" [...] by pretending to be holding a remote control. He explains that The Remote can control the action on-screen. He demonstrates by pressing various buttons, which control Shane's actions. For example, [...] "Fast Forward" [...] causes Shane to move and speak fast, [...] "Pause" [...] causes him to freeze, [...] "Rewind", which causes anyone to move and speak backwards, [...] "Mute", which causes Shane to speak without any sound. In many episodes, David discovers a previously unknown [...] "Wild-card Button," [...] such as [...] "Humongous" [...] (and its opposite, the [...] "Minute" [...] button). This button causes some strange and/or undesired effect. He presses unknown buttons on the remote after saying [...] "Hmm" [...] or [...] "Ooh, I wonder what this button does." [...] David then offers The Remote to the viewer and [...] "hands it over" [...] by reaching off-screen downward. The brothers direct the viewer to [...] "press the Play button." [...] At this point, a strange and/or undesired effect happens ("Uh-oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> someone <b>pressed</b> <b>the</b> _____ button"). The brothers encourage the viewer to fix the situation by pressing a button for opposite effect. When they ask the viewer to [...] "press play" [...] a second time, Shane says [...] "But whatever you do, don't <b>press</b> <b>the</b> -" [...] but he is almost finished when the joke is repeated, and the viewer must again <b>press</b> <b>the</b> button for the opposite effect. Finally, Shane and David ask the viewer to [...] "Just press Play" [...] a third time, and the opening credits begin.|$|R

Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also <b>the</b> writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R

The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> President is doing fine.
