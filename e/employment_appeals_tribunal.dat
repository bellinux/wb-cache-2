25|$|As {{manager of}} Shamrock Rovers, Collins {{struggled}} {{both on and}} off the pitch. Following a points deduction because the club presented fraudulent documents to the FAI licensing committee, after a season of poor results and in-fighting at the club, Shamrock Rovers faced relegation. Collins was first suspended for a week in November 2005 pending the resolution of an internal investigation. After Rovers were relegated for the first time ever Collins' contract was terminated.

2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] was {{nothing to do with the}} promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the <b>Employment</b> <b>Appeals</b> <b>Tribunal,</b> that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed to fall outside the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to employment policy he brought was one of upholding labour market flexibility. The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, and he sat in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E

50|$|Where a party {{believes}} the Tribunal has misapplied {{the law or}} acted perversely, the review process is inappropriate and the party must <b>appeal</b> to the <b>Employment</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>Tribunal.</b> For example, the right of an Employment Judge to strike-out {{all or part of}} a claim while sitting alone in a Case Management Discussion would be outside the power of the Employment Judge, and therefore amount to an error of law that the <b>Employment</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>Tribunal</b> could reverse.|$|R
