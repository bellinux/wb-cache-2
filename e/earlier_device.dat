50|$|During this time, Tainter {{worked with}} the Bells on several inventions, amongst them the {{photophone}} and phonograph, which they developed into the Graphophone, a substantial improvement of Edison's <b>earlier</b> <b>device,</b> for which Tainter received several patents along with the Bells. Edison subsequently sued the Volta Graphophone Company (of which Tainter was part owner) for patent infringement, but the case was settled by a compromise between the two.In 1886, he married Lila R. Munro, {{and over the next}} years worked in Washington, perfecting his graphophone and founding a company trying to market the Graphophone as a dictation machine: the first Dictaphone. In 1887 Tainter invented the helically wound paper tube as an improved graphophone cylinder. This design was light and strong, and came to be widely used in applications far removed from its original intent, such as mailing tubes and product containers.|$|E
50|$|English and French writers adopted this {{interpretation}} in different ways. When {{it appeared in}} George Wither's A collection of emblems: ancient and modern (1635), he was reusing the German plates of Gabriel Rollenhagen from twenty years <b>earlier.</b> <b>Device</b> 23 pictures the bear scrambling up a tree, his head surrounded by angry bees, and has the title Patior Ut Potiar (suffering for success). The accompanying poem points out that as the bear is prepared to suffer in pursuit of its appetite, so should the virtuous aspire to grow. James Merrick's poem of “The bears and the bees” (1763) introduces two of the animals (as had the 16th century illustration of Flowers of Virtue and of Manners). Though it concludes that “Pleasure’s ever bought with pain”, it does not draw the same moral parallel. The poem was much reprinted, including by Thomas Bewick in his 1818 edition of Select Fables of Aesop.|$|E
50|$|The reactor {{was called}} LOPO (for low power) because its power output was {{virtually}} zero. LOPO served the purposes {{for which it}} had been intended: determination of the critical mass of a simple fuel configuration and testing of a new reactor concept. LOPO achieved criticality, in May 1944 after one final addition of enriched uranium. Enrico Fermi himself was at the controls. LOPO was dismantled {{to make way for}} a second Water Boiler that could be operated at power levels up to 5.5 kilowatts. Named HYPO (for high power), this version used solution of uranyl nitrate as fuel whereas the <b>earlier</b> <b>device</b> had used enriched uranyl sulfate. This reactor became operative in December 1944. Many of the key neutron measurements needed in the design of the early atomic bombs were made with HYPO. By 1950 higher neutron fluxes were desirable, consequently, extensive modifications were made to HYPO to permit operation at power levels up to 35 kilowatts. This reactor was, of course, named SUPO. SUPO was operated almost daily until its deactivation in 1974.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{explosives}} {{operations have}} been and may continue {{to be an important}} component of the DOE mission at the NTS. This mission has been to conduct the nation`s nuclear testing program in a safe, secure, and efficient manner while assuring full compliance with state and federal regulations, and DOE order`s and directives. These operations have generally included assembly, disassembly or modification, staging, transportation, and tesbng of nuclear explosive devices. They may also include maintenance, repair, retrofit, and surveillance. The Device Assembly Facility (DAF) was constructed to provide a dedicated facility in which to prepare nuclear explosives assemblies for their intended disposition. This facility will provide for combined operations (replacing two separate facilities) and incorporates state-of-the-art safety and security features while minimizing the risks of environmental impacts. The facility has been completed but not yet operated, so the impacts to be considered will b e based on normal operations and not on the impacts of construction activities. The impacts will arise from nuclear explosives operations that require the handling of high explosives in combination with special nuclear materials. Wastes from operation of the <b>earlier</b> <b>device</b> assembly facilities have included grams of epoxies, pints of solvents, and small quantities of waste explosives. These are hazardous (includes radioactive) wastes and are disposed of in accordance with state and federal regulations. Assuming similar operations at the DAF, non-hazardous (includes non-radioactive) solid waste would be transported to a permitted landfill. Waste explosives would be sent to the Area 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit. Other hazardous waste would be sent to the Area 5 Radioactive Waste. Management Site for shipment or burial...|$|E
40|$|Coherent {{control is}} a {{fundamental}} challenge in quantum information processing (QIP). Our system of interest employs a local, isolated electron spin to coherently control nuclear spins. Coupled electron/nuclear spins are a promising candidate for QIP: nuclear spins are used for information storage and computation due to their long coherence times, while the electron {{is used as a}} spin actuator for initialization, information transfer, control, and readout. This is the first implementation of a local processor using the central qubit architecture. In this work, a robust integrated system for coherent control of these spins is proposed. The system includes a mechanical and cryogenic system for sample handling, cooling, and suspension; computer software for experimental control and optimal control pulse determination; and a custom-designed pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer with digital signal acquisition and processing. The spectrometer enhances and expands past contributions of J. S. Hodges and J. C. Yang, who built a first generation device capable of amplitude modulated control pulses. The new device features improved noise properties, higher power, better carrier and sideband rejection, and a more customizable analysis via digital signal processing. It also implements both amplitude and phase modulation of control pulses. Further, it introduces the ability to address different resonances in the spin system by switching intermediate frequencies while maintaining phase coherence. Our work concludes with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis that demonstrates improvement of more than a factor of 15 compared to the <b>earlier</b> <b>device.</b> by Mohamed Osama Abutaleb.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} heart activity {{based on}} implantable accelerometer devices {{have been demonstrated}} as efficient method that could provide higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional electrocardiography (ECG) method. The method can be specified for detection of ischemia on patient who has undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. The current implantable accelerometer devices are sutured to the heart surface {{and have to be}} removed before closing the patient’s chest since the device dimension is not suitable for closed chest implantation. According to a surgical point of view, a heart muscle implantable accelerometer device can properly present the heart motion without interfering with surrounding organs. The device can be suitable for both intraoperative and postoperative monitoring procedures. However, the heart muscle implantation requires miniaturization of the device to provide minimal tissue trauma and simple implantation procedure. This study focuses on development of a MEMSbased 3 -axis heart muscle implantable accelerometer device. The device is to be implanted into the heart muscle, remain in place after the thorax is closed, and be pulled out though an opening in chest wall after a few days when the intensive care is no longer needed. Five different versions of the heart muscle implantable accelerometer device were proposed and developed with regards to the prerequisites for the heart implantable medical devices including the regulatory compliances, and the clinical demands and the requirements of device components. These devices were categorised into two main groups built on two different commercial accelerometer sensors. In comparison to the earlier implantable accelerometer device, the dimensions of these five versions were significantly reduced in this study. The overall diameter of <b>earlier</b> <b>device</b> was 11 mm which was far different from the 3. 2 mmdiameter of the first version device and 2. 0 mmdiameter of the fifth version. A novel structure of heart muscle implantable accelerometer device was first conducted in the second version device which has been able to corporate with the pacing/sensing functionality as a temporary pacing wire. This study also suggested specific experimental set-ups for qualifying essential safety requirements (e. g. leakage current, tensile strength, flexural endurance, insulation strength) based on the standards and regulation for the implantable devices. Tests of the complete devices showed leakage currents are at least 1000 times less than the limit for heart implantable applications. This study also pointed out that the pulling strength of a device is important for accomplishing the implantation and removal of the device. Different versions of device provided different pulling strength which varied from 12 N up to 100 N. The muscle-implantation stability of different versions were demonstrated in this study depend on the device dimension, encapsulation structure, cable flexibility and the implantation method. The implantation procedures of different device versions and quality of the acceleration signals were verified and validated in several animal trials reported in detail in this stud...|$|E
