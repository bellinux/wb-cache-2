5|$|House Democrats <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} {{negotiate}} changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of Nicholas Altomanović's lands created friction between Tvrtko and George of Zeta, since the latter seized coastal župas which Tvrtko <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> annex. In early 1377, Tvrtko successfully plotted with the Travunians {{the takeover of}} Trebinje, Konavli, and Dračevica, making his final conquests of the Serbian lands. By that time, Serbia {{had been reduced to}} a patchwork of independent lordships.|$|E
5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} the {{diversion}} General Eisenhower had hoped for. The decision by Heidrich not to oppose the landings was made without reference to Kesselring's headquarters. Heidrich <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E

5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The Rules of the Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience. On June 29 the film was screened for the Minister of National Education and Fine Arts Jean Zay and for the jury of the annual Louis Delluc Prize for the best French film. When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and The Rules of the Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The Rules of the Game was highly anticipated and Zay <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> award it the prize. Renoir later {{said he thought the}} film would be commercially successful.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be {{on the trail of}} some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
5|$|According to Oricon, Avex Trax <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> ship {{approximately}} 400,000 total {{units in}} its first week of sales; as a result, the sales mark were printed and distributed for several stores throughout Japan. Rock 'n' Roll Circus debuted at {{number one on the}} Japanese Daily Oricon Albums Chart, staying there for an entire week. This resulted in the album debuting atop the Japanese Weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with an estimated 205,000 sold units {{in its first}} week of sales. This became the highest selling album by a female artist for first week sales of 2010. Rock 'n' Roll Circus became Hamasaki's tenth studio album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart for both Daily and Weekly rankings, making Hamasaki the first artist to have at least one album {{at the top of the}} charts for 12 consecutive years. Hamasaki also became the only female artist to have the most number one albums on Oricon since her debut with eleven entries, apart from Guilty which reached number two. It slipped to number three the following week, shifting 45,686 in Japan. It stayed in the top 10 for five weeks, and the top 300 with 23 weeks overall.|$|E

5|$|Hunt's 2001 {{scholarship}} came {{to fruition}} {{when he joined}} the Brisbane Broncos' main squad {{at the end of the}} 2003 season. He participated in the team's off-season training in early 2004, under the guidance of Broncos' coach Wayne Bennett, and was selected to participate in the Broncos' pre-season trial games in February. Hunt <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> play most of the 2004 season in the Queensland Cup, the second-tier rugby league competition in Queensland. However, after Darren Lockyer's shift to the five-eighth position and Hunt playing both trial games on the wing and scoring a try in the first game against the Melbourne Storm, he was selected to make his National Rugby League (NRL) debut for the Broncos in the first round of the 2004 season against the New Zealand Warriors, making him the youngest ever Bronco at seventeen. Coach Bennett's decision to name Hunt as the starting fullback was somewhat surprising, due to Hunt's original selection, the week before the match, on the interchange bench. He replaced Motu Tony in the fullback position.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April, Kane captained Tottenham for {{the first}} time in a 0–0 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. Two weeks later, he scored his 30th goal of the season in a 3–1 win against Newcastle United at St James' Park, making him the first Tottenham player to reach that {{milestone}} since Gary Lineker in 1991–92. Later that month, he was included as one of two forwards in the PFA Team of the Year, alongside Chelsea's Diego Costa. He was also voted the PFA Young Player of the Year. On 24 May 2015, he headed in an Eric Dier cross for the only goal of an away win at Everton on the final day of the season to confirm fifth place for Tottenham, thus qualifying them to the group stage of the following season's UEFA Europa League. It was his 21st goal of the league campaign, equalling a Premier League club record alongside Teddy Sheringham, Jürgen Klinsmann and Gareth Bale. At the end of the season, Kane remarked that he had done more in the single campaign than he <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> do in his whole career.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake is a lie, which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time as Galaxy Games protoype installation, Computer Space was released. It was the first coin-operated video game to be commercially sold (and the first widely {{available}} video game of any kind). While it did well in its initial locations near college campuses, it performed very poorly in bars and arcades where pinball and other arcade games were typically placed; while it was commercially successful and made over US$1,000,000, it did not meet the high expectations of Nutting, who <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> sell more than 1,500 units. Bushnell and Dabney immediately started work on another game, using the same television set design as Computer Space, as well as founding their own company Atari, Inc. to back their projects. While initially this game was to be a driving game that Bushnell planned to design, their first employee, Allan Alcorn, took a prototype ping-pong game suggestion of Bushnell's and expanded on it to create a game the company immediately seized on. They were unable to find a manufacturer, but on the evidence of the success of their prototype installation, decided to produce the game cabinets themselves. Pong was released in 1972, a year after Computer Space. It was immensely commercially successful, selling over 8,000 units. It inspired copycat games to be sold in America, Europe, and Japan, and led to the popularization of the medium.|$|E
5|$|At Homs, {{the brigade}} rested {{for two days}} and on 19 October headed for Er Rastan, with orders to repair a bridge over the River Orontes, which had been {{destroyed}} by retreating Turkish forces. The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron Royal Engineers, was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching Hama on 21 October. The brigade <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to Aleppo. The brigade was preceded by seven light armoured cars, but {{the remainder of the}} division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near Khan Tuman. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of Aleppo. The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-Alexandretta road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo, but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October, the position had been evacuated. Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo, so the brigade set off in pursuit. At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking Haritan to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons. The armoured cars of No. 12 Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at 11:30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack.|$|E
