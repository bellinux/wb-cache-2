50|$|The OM-1 is an all-mechanical SLR. It {{has a large}} {{viewfinder}} with interchangeable screens but a fixed prism. It {{also has}} a through-the-lens <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> controlling a <b>needle</b> visible in the viewfinder. It has a compact body, essentially retained on later models. The shutter speed dial is located around the lens mount, which allows photographers to keep the camera at the eye between shots more easily than SLRs with the dial located on the top plate.|$|R
50|$|The Olympus OM-1 was a {{manually-operated}} 35 mm single-lens {{reflex camera}} forming {{the basis of}} the OM system in 1972. At first called the Olympus M-1, Leica disputed this designation and it was changed to OM-1. It was designed by a team led by Yoshihisa Maitani with a through-the-lens <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> controlling a <b>needle</b> visible in the viewfinder. It was noted for its reduction of size, weight and noise. One feature unique to the OM-1, compared {{to the rest of the}} OM system, was its mirror lock-up facility which made it ideal for astrophotography and macrophotography.|$|R
50|$|The Contarex was {{the first}} 35mm SLR focal plane shutter camera {{providing}} direct meter coupling to the shutter-, aperture-, and film speed-settings; they are interconnected by cords. An aperture simulator for the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> in the Cyclops window uses an iris {{in front of the}} selenium meter cell. The <b>meter</b> <b>needle,</b> to be aligned with an index triangle, is visible both in a top plate window and to the right in the viewfinder.|$|R
50|$|The Contaflex Super, {{launched}} the following year, {{was based on}} the Rapid and had a coupled selenium <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> on the front side of the prism. It is easily recognized by the wheel on the front plate for the setting of the film speed (DIN). The <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> was visible in the finder {{as well as on the}} top plate from the outside. It is not to be confused with the Super (new) that will be discussed later.|$|R

50|$|Canon's sudden {{switch from}} professionally {{oriented}} SLR cameras to advanced amateur cameras happened in March 1964 {{when they left}} the Canon Canonflex range and launched the Canon FX with the FL lens mount. It has a built in CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> with a circular window on the right-hand camera front. The Canon FP without <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> was added later the same year. The cameras were well built, but the metering technology was several years behind the Minolta SR-7 which pioneered that technology in 1962. Then just half a year later, in the spring of 1965 Canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable Pellix. The new camera featured the much-expected TTL <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> facility, albeit employing the stop-down metering method.|$|R

50|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> uses a {{circular}} CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is to {{estimate}} the subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|R

50|$|Both units add the {{possibility}} of shutter-priority auto exposure mode by setting the lens's aperture ring to 'A'. The aperture needle disappears from the meter display, and the <b>meter</b> <b>needle</b> indicates what aperture the AE system has selected. Also, using either of the motor drive systems also enables use of electronic interval timers and remote shutter releases, both wired and wireless.|$|R

50|$|However, by the 1960s the clamour for in-camera <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> was rising. It was {{possible}} to attach an external CdS (Cadmium sulfide) <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> to the later AP-derived models, but in 1960 the next breakthrough arrived. At the 1960 photokina camera show, Asahi exhibited the Spot-matic prototype. This camera took exposure measurements, via a spotmeter, through the taking lens, an incredible innovation. The camera excited tremendous attention and in 1964 the first production Spotmatic (hyphen dropped) emerged. The Spotmatic was virtually identical to the prototype; however, the spotmeter was replaced with an all-over average-reading <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> {{in order to give}} more consistent results. The camera was an instant success and was snapped up by the thousands, although Asahi had been beaten into production by the Topcon RE Super which went on sale in April 1963; the Topcon failed to attract the same degree of commercial success. The Spotmatic was replaced by the Spotmatic II with many upgrades 1971 - 1976.|$|R
