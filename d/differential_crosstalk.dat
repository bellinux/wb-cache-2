40|$|Abstractβ-Catenin/Tcf and NF-κB {{pathways}} play {{an important}} role in biological functions. We determined the underlying mechanisms of differential interaction between two pathways in various human cancer cell lines. NF-κB positively regulated β-catenin/Tcf pathways in human glioblastoma, whereas it has an opposite effect on β-catenin/Tcf pathways in colon, liver, and breast cancer cells. Expression of lucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (lzts 2) was positively regulated by NF-κB activity in colon, liver, and breast cancer cells, whereas negatively regulated in glioma cells. Downregulation of lzts 2 increased the β-catenin/Tcf promoter activity and inhibited NF-κB-induced modulation of the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. These data indicate that the <b>differential</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between β-catenin/Tcf and NF-κB pathway in various cancer cells is resulted from the differences in the regulation of NF-κB-induced lzts 2 expression...|$|E
40|$|Studies with mutants in {{four members}} of the five-membered Arabidopsis {{phytochrome}} (phy) family (phyA, phyB, phyD, and phyE) have revealed differential photosensory and/or physiological functions among them, but identification of a phyC mutant has proven elusive. We now report the isolation of multiple phyC mutant alleles using reverse-genetics strategies. Molecular analysis shows that these mutants have undetectable levels of phyC protein, suggesting that they are null for the photoreceptor. phyC mutant seedlings were indistinguishable from wild-type seedlings under constant far-red light (FRc), and phyC deficiency had no effect in the phyA mutant background under FRc, suggesting that phyC does not participate in the control of seedling deetiolation under FRc. However, when grown under constant red light (Rc), phyC seedlings exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity, observable as longer hypocotyls and smaller cotyledons than those seen in the wild type. Although less severe, this phenotype resembles the effect of phyB mutations on photoresponsiveness, indicating that both photoreceptors function in regulating seedling deetiolation in response to Rc. On the other hand, phyB phyC double mutants did not show any apparent decrease in sensitivity to Rc compared with phyB seedlings, indicating that the phyC mutation in the phyB-deficient background does not have an additive effect. These results suggest that phyB is necessary for phyC function. This functional dependence correlates with constitutively lower levels of phyC observed in the phyB mutant compared with the wild type, a decrease that seems to be regulated post-transcriptionally. phyC mutants flowered early when grown in short-day photoperiods, indicating that phyC plays a role in the perception of daylength. phyB phyC double mutant plants flowered similarly to phyB plants, indicating that in the phyB background, phyC deficiency does not further accelerate flowering. Under long-day photoperiods, phyA phyC double mutant plants flowered later than phyA plants, suggesting that phyC is able to promote flowering in the absence of phyA. Together, these results suggest that phyC is involved in photomorphogenesis throughout the life cycle of the plant, with a photosensory specificity similar to that of phyB/D/E and with a complex pattern of <b>differential</b> <b>crosstalk</b> with phyA and phyB in the photoregulation of multiple developmental processes...|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the low impedance required by matching, PCB signal traces carry much more current than their on-chip counterparts. This larger current induces crosstalk primarily in a magnetic or inductive mode as opposed to a capacitive mode. To combat this crosstalk, digital PCB designers must remain acutely aware of not only the intended signal path for every signal, but also the path of returning signal current for every signal. The signal itself and its returning signal current path are equally capable of generating inductive <b>crosstalk.</b> <b>Differential</b> trace pairs help to reduce these effects.|$|R
40|$|In this Ph. D. thesis, a novel non-MC Random {{differential}} Equation based Statistical Timing Analysis (RESTA) {{method is}} proposed, which considers both process variations and electrical circuit effects, such as multiple input simultaneous switching and crosstalk effects. To make the approach practical {{for analysis of}} large circuits at high accuracy, we propose a Simplified Transistor Model (STM) for transistor-level timing analysis. For statistical delay calculation, instead of simulating thousands of times using Monte Carlo methods or simulating at many corners using corner-based methods, RESTA simulates only once, solving random <b>differential</b> equations directly. <b>Crosstalk</b> effects {{are taken into account}} based on our proposed Piecewise Linear Delay change curve Model (PLDM) for statistical interconnect delay calculation.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{biological}} {{phenomenon of}} cell fusion {{has been linked}} to several characteristics of tumour progression, including an enhanced metastatogenic capacity and an enhanced drug resistance of hybrid cells. We demonstrated recently that M 13 SV 1 -EGFP-Neo breast epithelial cells exhibiting stem cell characteristics spontaneously fused with MDA-MB- 435 -Hyg breast cancer cells, thereby giving rise to stable M 13 MDA 435 hybrid cells, which are characterised by a unique gene expression profile and migratory behaviour. Here we investigated the involvement of the PLC-β/γ 1, PI 3 K/AKT and RAS-RAF-ERK signal transduction cascades in the EGF and SDF- 1 α induced migration of two M 13 MDA 435 hybrid cell clones in comparison to their parental cells. Results Analysis of the migratory behaviour by using the three-dimensional collagen matrix migration assay showed that M 13 SV 1 -EGFP-Neo cells as well as M 13 MDA 435 hybrid cells, but not the breast cancer cell line, responded to EGF stimulation with an increased locomotory activity. By contrast, SDF- 1 α solely stimulated the migration of M 13 SV 1 -EGFP-Neo cells, whereas the migratory activity of the other cell lines was blocked. Analysis of signal transduction cascades revealed a putative <b>differential</b> RAF-AKT <b>crosstalk</b> in M 13 MDA 435 - 1 and - 3 hybrid cell clones. The PI 3 K inhibitor Ly 294002 effectively blocked the EGF induced migration of M 13 MDA 435 - 3 hybrid cells, whereas the EGF induced locomotion of M 13 MDA 435 - 1 hybrid cells was markedly increased. Analysis of RAF- 1 S 259 phosphorylation, being a major mediator of the negative regulation of RAF- 1 by AKT, showed decreased pRAF- 1 S 259 levels in LY 294002 treated M 13 MDA 435 - 1 hybrid cells. By contrast, pRAF- 1 S 259 levels remained unaltered in the other cell lines. Inhibition of PI 3 K/AKT signalling by Ly 294002 relieves the AKT mediated phosphorylation of RAF- 1, thereby restoring MAPK signalling. Conclusions Here we show that hybrid cells could evolve exhibiting a <b>differential</b> active RAF-AKT <b>crosstalk.</b> Because PI 3 K/AKT signalling has been chosen as a target for anti-cancer therapies our data might point to a possible severe side effect of AKT targeted cancer therapies. Inhibition of PI 3 K/AKT signalling in RAF-AKT crosstalk positive cancer (hybrid) cells could result in a progression of these cells. Thus, not only the receptor (activation) status, but also the activation of signal transduction molecules should be analysed thoroughly prior to therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Data {{services}} {{delivered on}} telephone twisted pair wiring can potentially suffer from crosstalk due to data services on other twisted pairs in proximity, limiting the data rate, the maximum loop length and {{the quantity and}} variety of data services that a bundle can support. The crosstalk from other data services couples to the twisted pair in common mode and leaks to differential mode due to imperfect line balance. This thesis uses the common mode signal as a reference to an adaptive wideband crosstalk canceller, {{in an attempt to}} remove or at least lower the effect of crosstalk on the useful differential signal. Simulation results show the potential benefits of using this technique to reduce the level of crosstalk on an ADSL <b>differential</b> signal with <b>crosstalk</b> coming from data services commonly found in the telephone bundles. This technique is not limited to ADSL but can be applied to any technology using twisted pair wiring as its transmission medium...|$|R
40|$|Coordination of the {{specific}} functions of α 5 β 1 and αvβ 3 integrins is crucial for the precise regulation of cell adhesion, spreading and migration, yet the contribution of <b>differential</b> integrin-specific <b>crosstalk</b> to these processes remains unclear. To determine {{the specific}} functions of αvβ 3 and α 5 β 1 integrins, we used nanoarrays of gold particles presenting immobilized, integrin-selective peptidomimetic ligands. Integrin binding to the peptidomimetics is highly selective, and cells can spread on both ligands. However, spreading is faster and the projected cell area is greater on α 5 β 1 ligand; both depend on ligand spacing. Quantitative analysis of adhesion plaques shows that focal adhesion size is increased in cells adhering to αvβ 3 ligand at 30 and 60 nm spacings. Analysis of αvβ 3 and α 5 β 1 integrin clusters indicates that fibrillar adhesions are more prominent in cells adhering to α 5 β 1 ligand, while clusters are mostly localized at the cell margins in cells adhering to αvβ 3 ligand. αvβ 3 integrin clusters are more pronounced on αvβ 3 ligand, though {{they can also be}} detected in cells adhering to α 5 β 1 ligand. Furthermore, α 5 β 1 integrin clusters are present in cells adhering to α 5 β 1 ligand, and often colocalize with αvβ 3 clusters. Taken together, these findings indicate that the activation of αvβ 3 integrin by ligand binding is dispensable for initial adhesion and spreading, but essential to formation of stable focal adhesions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In-band crosstalk, due to {{multiple}} interferers, {{has been identified}} {{as one of the most}} severe impairments in optical transparent networks, especially in the ones with a large number of nodes and a high wavelength density. Due to its robustness to in-band <b>crosstalk</b> <b>differential</b> phase-shift keying (DPSK) emerges as an attractive modulation scheme to be used in such environ-ments. This paper proposes a rigorous formulation to estimate the performance of direct-detection DPSK receivers using an eigen-function expansion technique in the time domain. The method takes into account both the in-band crosstalk, due to an arbitrary number of interfering terms, and the amplified spontaneous emission noise and is able to deal with any combination of optical and electrical filter shapes. Using this method the accuracy of an approximation based on the wideband optical filtering assump-tion was evaluated and shown that the approximation, although not providing reliable results for the error probabilities, can be used with confidence to compute power penalties due to in-band crosstalk. Furthermore, the crosstalk tolerance of DPSK over on-off keying was quantified and shown that this tolerance is reduced when the number of interferers increases.

40|$|Eukaryotes have {{developed}} evolutionarily conserved mechanisms {{to respond to}} diverse ranges of internal and external perturbations e. g., changes in oxygen/nutrient levels, temperature oscillations, protein folding load, viral/bacterial attacks and graft implants. Alterations and malfunctions within these core regulatory architectures provide a peek into shifts towards cancerous and disease states. These core architectures include signal integrators and actuators, positive and negative feedback mechanisms which mediate the effectiveness and ultimate outcome of the response. Contemporary modeling approaches {{in the era of}} genomics revolution and high-throughput technology presents a unique systems level insight into many areas of biology, ecology, developmental biology and immunology. In my research, I have used a combination of bottom-up analysis (signaling networks based analysis) and a top-down analysis (using microarray/high throughput experimental data) to investigate stress responses in eukaryotes. Using the bottom-up analysis scheme, we assembled a series of molecular modules describing different aspects of the cellular response to stress. Some of these modules included the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), Hypoxic Response (HR) and Tumor Angiogenesis, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), Translation Initiation and Renal Allograft Failure. These modules were modeled using mass action kinetics with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based framework to investigate the internal regula- tory cores. For example, in UPR we identified the differential negative feedback of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4) as the key in the adaptation phase via regulation of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). Similarly in HR, we identified the role of activator protein 1 (AP 1) in mediating the autocrine response via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL 8) signaling modules. Model generation was done using UNIVERSAL, an in house software freely available at google code. We addressed issues pertaining to uncertainties within these models by developing POETs, a multi-objective optimizing algorithm which allowed us to train our models with experimental data from the literature. POETs presented us with an advantage by generating an ensemble of models consistent with experimental data. The diversity within these ensembles were used to study different operational paradigms within these modules. For example, in EMT we identified the <b>differential</b> modes of <b>crosstalk</b> between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and SMADs in mediating the cellular transformation. These different modes of operation suggest insights into different diseases and irregularities in cellular adaptation. We subsequently analyzed these models using parameter independent structural analysis tools like extreme pathways and parameter dependent tools such as fragility and robustness to identify targets relevant to therapeutic interventions. These configurations represent experimentally testable hypothesis and potentially new strategies to manipulate the cellular responses. At an intermediate (length-scale) level, we developed multiscale modeling strategies by inductively extrapolating the consequences of cell signaling to tissue/organ function. We employed this (signaling assisted multiscale modeling (SAMM)) strategy to investigate tumor growth and angiogenesis. Using a top down strategy, we used microarray datasets to investigate cellular signaling, identify malfunctions and create predictive models to infer patient outcome in case of hypoxia induced tumor growth and angiogenesis...|$|R
