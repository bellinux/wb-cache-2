2500|$|Following the Restoration, diverse republican parties {{appeared}} once again, {{for example}} Castelar's Partido Demócrata—later the Partido Demócrata Posibilista (PDP) – and Cristino Martos's Partido Progresista Demócrata. Nonetheless, these parties, {{immersed in a}} system of <b>inequal</b> censitary suffrage between 1878 and 1890, were unable to compete with the large dynastic parties: the Liberal-Conservative Party of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo and Liberal Party of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta. Later Francisco Pi formed the Partido Republicano Democrático Federal (PRDF), Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla and José María Esquerdo created Partido Republicano Progresista (PRP), and Nicolás Salmerón established the Partido Republicano Centralista (PRC). These parties contributed a diverse set of independent republican deputies to the Spanish parliament. Factions of the PDP and the PRP branched off and fused to form the Partido Republicano Nacional. In 1898 the Fusión Republicana was formed, and in 1903 the creation of the Republican Union Party attempted to represent and fuse all streams of republican thought. However, two parties split from the Republican Union: Alejandro Lerroux's Partido Republicano Radical and Vicente Blasco's Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista. In that time the Catalan Centre Nacionalista Republicà (CNR) appeared. Following the acts of [...] "Tragic Week" [...] in Barcelona in 1909, republican parties and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party ("PSOE" [...] in Spanish) joined together to form the Conjunción Republicano-Socialista, {{at the same time as}} the Catalan sectors of the Republican Union, the CNR, and the PRDF formed the Republican Nationalist Federal Union. Later Melquiades Álvarez split from the Conjunción Republicano-Socialista to form the Reformist Party.|$|E

5000|$|Sokoloff and Engerman {{hypothesize that}} in {{societies}} founded with greater inequality, the elites gained {{more power to}} influence the choice of legal and economic institutions. In those countries which are <b>inequal,</b> small elites restrict majority people's rights, such as education and votes, to perpetuate the social structures and continue to make themselves [...] "elites." [...] The U.S. began its economic growth largely through slave labor and trade of the output of that labor. As the elites enacted policy to generate more economic equality, for example by increasing literacy rates, the U.S. GDP per capita pulled ahead of other long-since established countries along with the literacy rates. It is essential to note that factor endowments {{played a crucial role}} in shaping the colonies institutions and economic growth; colonies with a richer quality of soil grew cash crops such as sugar, coffee, and cotton, which were most efficiently grown using plantation systems. As such, the demand for not only slave labor but also peonage within these colonies grew. Due to the vast inequality that the society developed due to a small elite population in comparison to the vast laborer population, they were able to maintain the wealth and power within the elite class via establishing a guarded franchise. The inequalities within the cash crop colonies resulted in their economy not being able to expand and grow as fast as the U.S and Canada, due to restrictive policies. Those policies in <b>inequal</b> countries curb the intellectual development of most people who are only required to do simple manual jobs; however, US and Canada encourage their people to take part in education. As a result, US and Canada excel with higher productivities which are supported by advanced technology.|$|E
5000|$|The first post-apartheid City Council {{was created}} in 1995. The council adopted the slogan [...] "One City, One Taxpayer" [...] in order to {{highlight}} its primary goal of addressing <b>inequal</b> tax revenue distribution. To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would help pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a substantially autonomous local regional authority {{that was to be}} overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like Sandton and Randburg, poorer neighbouring townships such as Soweto and Alexandra, and informal settlements like Orange Farm. The four councils or Metropolitan Local Councils (MLCs) were the Northern MLCl, Southern MLC, Eastern MLC and Western MLC (sometimes referred to as Metropolitan Substructures), under a central metropolitan council. This arrangement ended in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875 Platou {{applied to}} become {{professor}} of jurisprudence, but lost out to Bernhard Getz. He instead became assessor in Oslo City Court in 1876. He also wrote the work Om Livsforsikringskontraktens Natur on insurance law, released in 1887. He {{was a member}} of several law-preparing commissions. His ideal was Roman law, and he regarded the attempts of making Norwegian laws without using Roman law as [...] "smelling of whey cheese". In October 1890 he was finally appointed as a professor of jurisprudence at the Royal Frederick University. He was a productive author, with works such as Forelæsninger over norsk Arveret (1899, inheritance law), Forelæsninger over Ægteskabs Stiftelse og Skilsmisse (1899, marital law), Forelæsninger over norsk Søret (1900, maritime law), Forelæsninger over norsk Selskabsret (two volumes 1906 and 1911, corporate law), Umyndiges Retshandler (1911), Forelæsninger over udvalgte Emner af Privatrettens almindelige Del (two volumes 1912 and 1914) and Forelæsninger over Retskildernes Theori (1915). It has been noted that these works were [...] "qualitatively of highly <b>inequal</b> value", with Forelæsninger over norsk Arveret and Forelæsninger over norsk Søret being the most important.|$|E

5000|$|Dangal {{performed}} {{particularly well}} in China. This was attributed partly to Khan's popularity in China {{owing to the}} success of his previous films 3 Idiots (2009) and PK (2014) there. It was also reported that the audiences could relate to the underlying social theme of Dangal in that it portrayed the success story of sisters in the backdrop of a patriarchal and gender <b>inequal</b> society, much like the conditions inherent in China. Another factor was that the film filled a [...] "vacuum" [...] created by lack of interest among filmgoers due to [...] "poor quality of domestic films" [...] and China's ban on the [...] "wildly popular" [...] Korea dramas on television and streaming platforms due Korea's acceptance to the deployment of American THAAD missile defense system, in August 2016. Consequently, an earning of between 200 crore and 300 crore was expected. On the day of its release, 5 May 2017, Dangal had a screen share of 13.3 per cent with 30,000 screenings, much lower than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, (43.9 per cent), the number one film for the previous week. On its fourth day, the first Monday, it rose to 17.7 per cent, and an occupancy rate of over 33 per cent was reported, as against a highest of 24.7 per cent for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Immediately after, aided by word-of-mouth publicity, people reportedly thronged the theatres, and screenings were increased to 35,000 on the second Saturday and 55,000 the following day. During the time, the film began trending in Sina Weibo. The run continued into its third week with 2.7 million tickets sold on the Sunday. As the film grossed 900 crore in the country on 29 May, Forbes wrote, [...] "Dangal has inspired a simultaneous outpouring of pride, wonderment, and even disbelief in India's film community. No Indian movie has ever earned so much money, so quickly, in a market outside India." [...] With 27 per cent share in ticket sales, it was the highest earning film in China for the month.|$|E
