40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the effects of saline, heparin 2 units (U) per ml saline, and heparin 10 U/ml saline flush solutions on the duration of intravenous (i. v.) locks and the incidence of i. v. infiltration in neonates. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind experiment. SETTING: Tertiary-care nursery. PARTICIPANTS: Neonates (N = 90) hospitalized at birth in the intensive, intermediate care, or newborn units. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total hours <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> <b>i.</b> v. was inserted to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> <b>i.</b> v. was removed; hours <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> <b>i.</b> v. was first flushed to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> <b>i.</b> v. was removed; number of i. vs. removed because of infiltration. RESULTS: No statistical or clinical differences between the three groups for duration of i. v. nor for incidence of complications. CONCLUSIONS: The use of heparin in i. v. lock flush solution did not affect the duration of i. v. locks nor the incidence of infiltration in neonates...|$|R

2500|$|At the time, Freud was {{tolerant}} {{of what happened}} between Jung and Spielrein, and regarded it {{as an example of}} countertransference. Later, he confessed to Spielrein that it had played a part in the schism between him and Jung: [...] "His behavior was too bad. My opinion changed a great deal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> received that first letter from you". The relationship between Jung and Spielrein demonstrated to Freud that a therapist's emotions and humanity could not be kept out of the psychoanalytic relationship. Jung had come to the same conclusion. Before this episode, Freud apparently believed that a doctor could numb his emotions when analyzing patients. When Jung came to Freud about his relationship with Spielrein, Freud changed his ideas about the relationship between doctor and patient. Spielrein herself seems to have regarded her experiences with Jung as overall more beneficial than otherwise. She continued to yearn for him for several years afterwards, and wrote to Freud that she found it harder to forgive Jung for leaving the psychoanalytic movement than for [...] "that business with me".|$|E

2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument.

There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times."

[...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E
