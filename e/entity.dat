5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the <b>entity</b> travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The <b>entity</b> suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the <b>entity.</b> The agents and police return to the crack house, where the <b>entity</b> has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the <b>entity</b> disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E

A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the <b>entity</b> needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the <b>entity.</b> Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the <b>entity</b> back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and the <b>entity</b> cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the <b>entity</b> escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the <b>entity</b> from attacking another victim.|$|E

40|$|From Page 40 {{on to be}} rewritten. 2 We {{suggest a}} new {{approach}} to domain analysis. The approach is based on the idea of formal concepts [23].

This idea is then concretised, 3 considerably, in the form of analysing <b>entities</b> into either endurant <b>entities</b> and perdurant <b>entities,</b> and endurant <b>entities</b> into discrete, and, when so, into either atomic or composite, or continuous <b>entities</b> and, for discrete endurants, with qualities of unique identity, mereology and attributes.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of geographical <b>entities</b> between the raster and vector data structures introduces {{errors in the}} <b>entities</b> position. The vector to raster conversion results {{in a loss of}} information, since, when a Boolean classification of each pixel is used, the <b>entities</b> shape must follow the shape of the pixels. Thus, the information about the position of the <b>entities</b> in the vector data structure is lost with the conversion. This loss can be minimized if, instead of making a Boolean classification of the pixels, a fuzzy classification is performed, building Fuzzy Geographical <b>Entities.</b> These <b>entities</b> keep, for each pixel, the information about the pixel area that was inside the vector <b>entities</b> and therefore only the information about the position of the <b>entities</b> boundaries inside the pixels is lost. The Fuzzy Geographical <b>Entities</b> obtained through the previous conversion may be converted back to the vector data structure. An algorithm was developed to reconstruct the boundaries of the vector geographical <b>entities</b> using the information stored in the raster Fuzzy Geographical <b>Entities.</b> Since the grades of membership represent partial membership of the pixels to the <b>entities,</b> this information is valuable to reconstruct the <b>entities</b> boundaries in the vector data structure, generatin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Comparing <b>entities</b> is an {{important}} part of decision making. Several approaches have been reported for mining comparable <b>entities</b> from Web sources to improve user experience in comparing <b>entities</b> online. However, these efforts extract only <b>entities</b> explicitly compared in the corpora, and may exclude <b>entities</b> that occur less-frequently but potentially comparable. The prerequisite step of this task is to find comparable <b>entities.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel Bootstrapping algorithm to address the task by mining comparable <b>entities</b> from comparative questions in a collection of questions (e. g., that users posted on-line). For example, a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method can be used to identify comparative questions, comparative patterns, and extract comparable <b>entities.</b> The comparable <b>entities</b> can be used to help users make alternate decisions by comparing relevant mining <b>entities,</b> instead of providing merely recommendation, as is currently provided. By using bootstrapping technique <b>entities</b> has to be extracted with a specific relation. However, our task is different from the previous one that it requires not only extracting <b>entities</b> but also ensuring that the <b>entities</b> are extracted from comparative questions (comparative question identification), which is generally not required in information extraction task. Finally, the ranking is provided based on the user’s perspective for <b>entities</b> listed. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework can outperform the baseline systems...|$|R
