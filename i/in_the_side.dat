5|$|A {{particular}} thorn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Scottish Crown at {{the turn}} of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206).

The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
