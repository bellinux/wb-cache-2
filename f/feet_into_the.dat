5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of}} the French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E

5|$|Water brakes {{were first}} {{introduced}} on SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a splashdown element, in which {{a body of water}} surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air behind it.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, and like the previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

25|$|The game's combat uses ragdoll physics, {{which allows}} {{characters}} {{to be launched}} several <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, {{making it possible to}} juggle enemies by striking them repeatedly. Enemies can also be thrown or otherwise knocked into one another, causing all of them to take damage at once.|$|E
25|$|Several notable {{buildings}} were relatively {{untouched by the}} quake. One significant example is the Torre Latinoamericana. Despite being 44 stories tall, it survived the 1985 event almost undamaged. It was constructed with two hundred piles extending down over a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stable earth stratum.|$|E

25|$|On 16 May 1929 Scholefield {{was killed}} when the {{aircraft}} crashed and burned at Shepperton {{on the shore of}} the River Thames. Scholefield and his Mechanic S.W. Sherratt were test flying the Vanguard airliner from Brooklands Aerodrome when control was lost and the aircraft nose-dived from 2000 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. Observers had seen something fluttering away from the tail just before the aircraft dived. Scholefield was killed in the burnt wreck, and Sherratt who had jumped from the aircraft died from the fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} Balinese Room, {{a former}} mafia-run nightclub on a pier that had extended 600 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and had withstood many serious storms, was swept away as Ike's eye {{crossed over the}} eastern half of Galveston Island. The elevated structure,a pier, which had hosted performers ranging from Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and George Burns to Groucho Marx and Sammy Davis, Jr., had recently been renovated and returned to profitability after years of neglect and disrepair, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|The pool ranges {{in depth}} from four feet to depths of over eight feet near the grand waterfall, with a two-foot kiddy pool near the {{lifeguard}} station; {{the station is}} atop a bridge leading out to an island with two full size palm trees on it. A grotto, where natural water-filled caves stretch back over twelve <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hillside, is located across the pool from the island. There is a sandy sunning area for sunbathers and a café area that is commonly used for weddings and receptions. A walking path surrounds the whole complex.|$|E

25|$|The first Whirlwind {{was written}} off on 7 August when Pilot Officer McDermott had a tyre blow out while taking off in P6966. In {{spite of this}} {{he managed to get}} the {{aircraft}} airborne. Flying Control advised him of the dangerous condition of his undercarriage. PO McDermott bailed out of the aircraft between Grangemouth and Stirling. The aircraft dived in and buried itself eight <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. On recent inspection of the salvaged wreck of P6966, it was noticed that the defective tyre fitted was not of the correct size for a Whirlwind. Instead, it was the correct size for a Hurricane which 263 Squadron was also flying.|$|E
25|$|Flight 185 {{remained}} {{level at}} FL350 until it started a rapid and nearly vertical dive around 16:12. While descending through , {{parts of the}} aircraft, including a great extent of the tail section, started to separate from the aircraft's fuselage due to high forces arising from the nearly supersonic dive. Seconds later, the aircraft impacted the Musi River, near Palembang, Sumatra, killing all 104 people on board. The time it took the aircraft to dive from cruise altitude to the river was less than one minute. The plane was travelling faster {{than the speed of}} sound for a few seconds before impact. Parts of the wreckage were embedded 15 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> riverbed.|$|E
25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air {{and at the top}} features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E

25|$|Columns were drilled 80 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{ground at}} the blast site and then back filled with a colored soil mix to measure the {{expected}} horizontal and vertical displacement. Various military targets were also placed around the blast site. Local residents in Medicine Hat may have seen unusual cargo arriving on rail flatcars including heavy Jupiter and Nike configuration rockets. Other targets included a minefield, chambers and tunnels, reinforced concrete arches, fiberglass shelters, full scale troop models exposed and inside vehicles and gas masks. 60% of the targets were buried. Smoke mortars were installed to provide a white trail by which the shock wave could be tracked high above ground. An RCAF Neptune aircraft was also immediately above the test area for aerial photography.|$|E
25|$|Knievel and his daredevils debuted on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The {{show was}} a huge success. Knievel {{received}} several offers to host the show after their first performance. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt {{in which he would}} jump, spread-eagled, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle hit him in the groin, tossing him fifteen <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air. He was hospitalized {{as a result of his}} injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.|$|E
25|$|Except in {{the north}} and south ends of the island, the avenues would begin with First Avenue on the east side and run through Twelfth Avenue in the west. In addition, where the island was wider, there would be four {{additional}} lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D. Some of the avenues, such as Twelfth Avenue, ran through land that did not as yet exist, but the state legislation which created the Commission also authorized the city to extend its boundaries 400 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hudson and East Rivers, so the land required for these new streets would eventually be created. Broadway, an existing road, {{was not included in the}} 1811 plan, and was added to the grid later.|$|E
