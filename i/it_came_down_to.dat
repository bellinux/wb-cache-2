25|$|The Japanese threw {{themselves}} repeatedly {{against the}} defences {{of the two}} strong points, in the battles of Imphal and Kohima, but could not break through. At times the supply situation was perilous, but never totally critical. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a battle of attrition, and the British forces could simply afford to fight that kind of battle for longer. In the end, the Japanese ran out of supplies, and suffered large casualties. They broke and fled back into Burma, pursued by elements of Fourteenth Army.|$|E
25|$|The Bucs {{made the}} playoffs again by winning their {{division}} in the 1981 season. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a thrilling final game at Detroit; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR Kevin House and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT David Logan sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Bucs, 38–0, in the divisional round.|$|E
25|$|The Manhattan Project had pursued both avenues, and the {{scientists}} who had worked at Los Alamos were aware of work there with composite cores that used both; but there were concerns that Britain might not have the money, resources or skilled manpower for this.

A reactor and separation plant capable of producing enough plutonium for fifteen bombs per year was costed at around £20 million.|$|E

25|$|After one day off {{the semifinals}} started with Sweden versus the Czech Republic. The first period was equal with both teams scoring one goal. Andreas Engqvist scored {{midway through the}} second period to put Sweden up 2–1. This lead held into very late in the third period. With 1:13 {{left in the third}} period the Czechs pulled their goalie to get a six on five {{opportunity}} and Karel Rachůnek scored the 2–2 equalizer with just 7.5 seconds left, putting the game into overtime.

25|$|The third Test, {{the only}} one ever to be played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143 runs, {{following}} a brilliant century by Victor Trumper before lunch on the first day.

Tate hit a four, but was bowled by Jack Saunders with the fourth ball of his over. England came back to win the final Test, conceding a first-innings deficit of 141, then going to 48 for five needing 263 to win, before Gilbert Jessop hit a hundred in 75 minutes and England won by one wicket.|$|E

Pompey is protected from investigation by his prominent master, however, and reveals himself as a real Marxist when the Negro uprisings break out. Featherston allows Negro workers to serve an artillery piece to repel a US attack.

25|$|In 1988–89 {{the tournament}} was renamed to the Geddes Grant Shield, and with that, Jamaica's run of finals {{appearances}} was ended, {{as they were}} knocked out by Windward Islands on run rate per wicket lost. The Windward Islands {{went on to the}} final with Guyana, and after being set 155 to win, they lost their first three wickets for five runs. Opener Darwin Telemaque then put on 43 with captain Julian Charles before retiring hurt, and two wickets from Guyana captain Roger Harper sent the Windwards to 85 for 6. Needing 70, and with only three men left, Telemaque returned – only to have two of his partners run out, and the Windwards were 99 for 8. Telemaque stuck in, however, adding 39 with Ian Allen, before number 11 Dominique Lewis came in to bat in his List A debut with 17 needed. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last over, and the Windwards managed to take the winning runs, becoming one-wicket victors.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the final}} week of play, the Senators needed three points in three games to {{guarantee}} a playoff position ahead of the Washington Capitals, who held an edge in a tie-breaker between the teams. In the first game, Montreal would defeat the Senators 3–0. According to The Globe and Mail, before the next game on April 3 in Toronto, Ottawa employed the use of sports psychologist Dr. Max Offenberger. The Senators defeated the Maple Leafs 8–2 and Antoine Vermette scored a hat-trick. Three of the Senators' goals were scored short-handed; {{it was the third}} time in franchise history that the Senators had scored three short-handed goals in a single game, with the two previous games being a 5–2 home win against the Florida Panthers on November 18, 2000, and a 7–2 road win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 2, 2006. However, they lost Alfredsson and Fisher to injuries, adding to Chris Kelly, who was already sidelined. The Capitals continued to win, and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Senators final game, on April 4 at home against the Boston Bruins, needing one point to clinch a spot. Despite a 2–1 Senators' loss that night, the Carolina Hurricanes fell to the Florida Panthers and the Senators clinched a playoff berth for the 11th-straight season.|$|E

500|$|The name Aspirin {{was derived}} from the name of the {{chemical}} ASA—Acetylspirsäure in German. Spirsäure (salicylic acid) was named for the meadowsweet plant, Spirea ulmaria, from which it could be derived. Aspirin took a- for the acetylation, -spir- from Spirsäure, and added -in as a typical drug name ending to make it easy to say. In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Aspirin and Euspirin; Aspirin, they feared, might remind customers of aspiration, but Arthur Eichengrün argued that Eu- (meaning [...] "good") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on Aspirin.|$|E
500|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{making the}} monster (The Ubermenscher), the staffers were torn.

[...] Makeup supervisor John Vulich eventually {{came up with a}} design for the monster that was, effectively, a foam suit. The suit was made out of urethane to give it a bubbly appearance.

As the film was eventually edited, however, {{more and more of the}} monster was cut, until it became more of an [...] "unseen" [...] menace. Various X-Files staffers later gave the character a variety of nicknames, including [...] "Gumby on Steroids," [...] "Mr. Butterworth," [...] "Fecal Fred," [...] and [...] "The Shit Monster." ...|$|E

Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning The Rock, but Kurt Angle, a Team Alliance member, revealed his true allegiance by hitting Austin {{in the head with a}} title belt. The Rock then pinned Austin, forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock closed out 2001 by losing the World Championship at Vengeance to Chris Jericho, who would unify the WWF and WCW titles later that night.|$|E
500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches.

The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I {{think it was the}} best music for the whole record.

500|$|The first Ryder Cup {{match was}} contested in June 1927. The {{competition}} held at Worcester Country Club was won 9½–2½ by the United States. British captain Ted Ray cited the Americans' [...] "superior putting" [...] {{as the reason}} for their victory. Great Britain improved for the 1929 competition, winning 7–5 at Moortown Golf Club. However, they were unable to replicate this performance in 1931. In 100 degree heat and missing a number of their best players, they were unable to match the Americans at the Scioto Country Club and lost 9–3. The 1933 contest at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club was a closer affair than previous matches. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the final match between Syd Easterbrook and Denny Shute. The American Shute had a putt to win the competition, but missed two in succession leaving Easterbrook with a putt to win the contest, which he made to secure a 6½–5½ victory for the British team. The United States regained the Cup in 1935, when they beat Great Britain 9–3 at Ridgewood Country Club. They became the first team to win the competition outside of their own country in 1937 when they beat the British team 8–4 at Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club.|$|E
