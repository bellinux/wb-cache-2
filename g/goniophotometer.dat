40|$|To {{enable the}} fast and {{accurate}} cataloging of material samples, I designed a filtration device for selecting specific visible and near-infrared light wavelengths {{related to the}} red, green, and blue sensitivity peaks of a visible detection camera and the pixel response for a near-infrared camera. This filter device functions {{in conjunction with the}} Department of Architecture's Daylighting Laboratory <b>goniophotometer</b> to profile the complete reflection and transmission properties for sample building materials. The resulting data is used in computer simulations and material optimization. The <b>goniophotometer</b> uses two types of detection cameras, color and infrared, to measure the light that is transmitted or reflected off a sample of material. The spectral sensitivity variances of the cameras create inaccuracies in the resulting data when full-spectrum light is used. To remove these inaccuracies, the light is filtered into smaller sections of the full spectrum and the data is recombined by software, to remove these inaccuracies. The device to filter the light {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The final filter design uses a geneva drive to index wheels containing pairs of high-pass and low-pass filters into the light path between the light source and the test specimen. (cont.) The device satisfies the design specifications dictated by the usability, function and spatial constraints. This design should prove to be very reliable and flexible through its continued use in studying building materials.

To encourage such {{use of natural}} light, a dual experimental device is being developed at MIT to help {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various daylighting approaches, {{to be used as a}} <b>goniophotometer</b> for materials and coatings analysis and as a heliodon for studying scale models. The <b>goniophotometer</b> will be used to conduct detailed assessments of the bidirectional transmission or reflecting distribution function ("BT(R) DF") properties of building materials, using a CCD camera to produce a luminance map of the emerging light distribution. The heliodon mode will be used to as an educational tool to perform qualitative evaluations of shadow patterns by simulating sunlight illumination on scale models. This thesis focuses on several aspects of this larger project. This thesis first describes the design of an illumination system appropriate for both functions of the joint goniophotometer/heliodon.

This thesis then describes the design and manufacture of a light collection system for the <b>goniophotometer</b> mode, specifically the design and fabrication of an acrylic semi-ellipsoid with a half-mirrored coating that focuses the collected light at the CCD camera used for collection and analysis. Finally, this thesis describes the calibration of the light detection system (the color CCD camera) to make its spectral sensitivity match that of the human eye. With this calibration, the CCD camera will be useful not only as a component of the goniophotometer/heliodon system, but may also be adapted to serve as a freestanding multi-point luminance meter for the characterization of BT(R) DFs for various materials of interest. by Courtney A.

40|$|To obtain {{realistic}} {{results in}} lighting simulation software, realistic models of light sources are needed. A near-field {{model of a}} light source is accurate, and {{can be obtained by}} a near-field <b>goniophotometer.</b> This type of <b>goniophotometer</b> is conventionally equipped with a V(Î») -filter. However, the advent of new light sources with spatial- or angular color variations necessitates the inclusion of spectral information about the source. We demonstrate a method to include spectral information of a light source in ray tracing. We measured the relative angular variation of the spectrum of an OLED using a spectroradiometer mounted on a near-field <b>goniophotometer.</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) is exploited {{to reduce the amount of}} data that needs to be stored. Also a photometric ray file of the OLED was obtained. To construct a set of monochromatic ray files, the luminous flux in the original ray file is redistributed over a set of wavelengths and stored in separate ray files. The redistribution depends on the angle of emission and the spectral irradiance measured in that direction. These ray files are then inserted in ray tracing software TracePro. Using the OLED as a test source, the absolute spectral irradiance is calculated at an arbitrary position. The result is validated using a spectroradiometer to obtain the absolute spectral irradiance at that particular point. A good agreement between the simulated and measured absolute spectral irradiance is found. Furthermore, a set of tristimulus ray files is constructed and used in ray tracing software to generate a uâ€²vâ€²-color coordinate distribution on a surface. These values are in agreement with the color coordinate distribution found using the spectral ray files. Whenever spectral or color information is desired at a task area, the proposed method allows for a fast and efficient way to improve the accuracy of simulations using ray tracing. status: publishe...|$|E

The DRC comprises a stack of tilted aluminum louvers with configurable inclination angle. The profile of the louvers is designed to control transmission depending on sun altitude, and to redirect light up towards the ceiling The measured BSDF of the DRC is obtained from a scanning <b>goniophotometer.</b> For a sparse set of three source directions, the distribution is recorded at â‰ƒ 250, 000 receiver directions. The asymmetric angular resolution allows detailed observation of characteristic features in the distribution, which are assumed to persist over a range of source directions. For each pair of source and receiver directions in the measurement, the computed BSDF is generated from {{a model of the}} DRC, replicating the measurement with a virtual <b>goniophotometer.</b> The simulation relies only on the enhanced photon map extension for Radiance. The BSDF from measurement and simulation are compared qualitatively and quantitatively to discuss the degree of accordance.

The direct-hemispherical transmission is compared for each measurement and simulation. The RMSE of each computed distribution against the corresponding measurements is calculated to quantify the directionally resolved deviation. A high degree of qualitative accordance between the computed and the measured BSDF is achieved. Prominent features in the BSDF are represented by the model. A deviation of âˆ’ 6 % to + 15 % is observed in a quantitative comparison of direct-hemispherical transmission by integration of computed and measured BSDF.

Aim is to measure spatial characteristics of luminous parts of the luminaires and light sources represented by luminous intensity distribution curve which is needed for lighting computation at level of the preparation of lighting design. Near-field goniophotometry is still a forthcoming technology widely used in photometric laboratories all over the world. Due to compact design of these systems the laboratory space can be saved and they can be installed in a room of usual dimensions because they do not obey the inverse square law from {{point of view of the}} whole dimension of the luminaire. The principle of these goniophotometers of the luminance distribution is measurement of luminous part of the luminaires and light sources. By integration over solid angle from this fundamental photometric quantity luminous intensity in particular direction in the space represented by two angles depending on measurement planes is derived. Although theoretical principle and physical model is well-known and defined, in practical realisation of this system some problems occur. One of the problems is traceability to SI units. This fact disqualifies near-field <b>goniophotometer</b> in standards relating to goniophotometry.
