5|$|Baird defended another Conservative {{government}} decision to cut funds for climate science research, arguing that further studies are largely superfluous {{in light of}} recent United Nations reports. Gordon McBean of the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences has disagreed, claiming that <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> the best way to adapt to a changing climate.|$|E
5|$|Creating {{a native}} pet {{industry}} in Australia related to quolls could aid in their conservation. However, concerns exist about this methodology {{in regards to}} animal husbandry, conservation benefits, and other issues. Some scientists believe that keeping quolls as pets could aid in their long-term conservation, but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed on this topic to conclude whether this is true or false.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} MS is unknown; however, it is {{believed}} to occur {{as a result of}} some combination of genetic and environmental factors such as infectious agents. Theories try to combine the data into likely explanations, but none has proved definitive. While {{there are a number of}} environmental risk factors and although some are partly modifiable, <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to determine whether their elimination can prevent MS.|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum. In March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. <b>Further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to determine the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

5|$|The {{measured}} deposition temperature {{indicated that}} hassium(VIII) oxide is less volatile than osmium tetroxide, OsO4, and places hassium firmly in group 8. However, the enthalpy of adsorption for HsO4 measured, (−46 ± 2) kJ/mol, {{was significantly lower}} than what was predicted, (−36.7 ± 1.5) kJ/mol, indicating that OsO4 was more volatile than HsO4, contradicting earlier calculations, which implied {{that they should have}} very similar volatilities. For comparison, the value for OsO4 is (−39 ± 1) kJ/mol. It is possible that hassium tetroxide interacts differently with the different chemicals (silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) used for the detector; <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> required, including more accurate measurements of the nuclear properties of 269Hs and comparisons with RuO4 in addition to OsO4.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to fully establish {{the function of the}} luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|Several Psilocybe {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The authors also note that the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
