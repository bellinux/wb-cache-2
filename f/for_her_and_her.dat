Her husband joined Cain's presidential campaign as state director for Tennessee after hearing him speak at events where Branch performed. Branch said Cain {{was a natural}} choice <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband because she felt their beliefs aligned with Cain's. Since 2010, she received three payments that totaled $10,000 for live entertainment services provided at political rallies from several political action committees associated with Cain's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.|$|E

5|$|Stanton died {{of heart}} failure {{at her home in}} New York City on October 26, 1902, 18 years before women were granted the right to vote in the United States. She was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, the grave upon which there is a {{monument}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband. Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton had been unable to attend a formal college or university, her daughters did. Margaret Livingston Stanton Lawrence attended Vassar College (1876) and Columbia University (1891), and Harriot Stanton Blatch received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Vassar College in 1878 and 1891 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Tony's second {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one and Hannah soon lost all tolerance for her fun-loving husband.

They separated in 1985, after which Tony {{bought a house in}} disuse at Number 3 Albert Square and set about making it habitable, leaving Hannah to move in with another man. Kelvin soon joined Tony on the square, although it took him a lot to persuade his wife to allow him custody of their son.|$|E
25|$|The final {{prediction}} of the male-assistance hypothesis {{has been extensively}} investigated. It predicts that females will exhibit differing mate preferences during fertile and non-fertile periods. Specifically, when fertile, the females will be sensitive to indicators of high genetic quality to increase the genetic quality of her offspring. Conversely, outside of the fertile period, females will show a preference for males who can provide resources <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> offspring. In most species, males of higher genetic quality offer fewer non-genetic resources (such as shelter and food) than those of lower quality, so females are likely to choose different males at each stage.|$|E

25|$|Morton {{was born}} in Clifton, Nottingham, the third child of Pamela Freebury, a factory worker, and Peter Morton. She has six half-siblings from her parents' relationships, {{subsequent}} to their 1979 divorce. She lived with her father until she was eight when she was made a ward of court, because neither of her parents could care <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> siblings. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and her mother {{was involved in a}} violent relationship with her second husband, and as a result, she never lived with her parents again. The next nine years were spent in and out of foster care and children's homes. During that time, she attended West Bridgford Comprehensive School and joined the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, soon being offered small-screen roles in Soldier Soldier and Boon.|$|E
25|$|Petitioners {{for freedom}} often claimed that a promised manumission {{had not been}} fully executed. Charlotte Dupuy, a {{domestic}} slave of Henry Clay, in 1829 filed a freedom suit <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> two children while they were living with Clay in Washington, DC, during his service as Secretary of State. Dupuy claimed that her previous master had promised to free her. The court required Clay to leave Dupuy in the capital until the case was settled, although he had completed his service and was returning to Kentucky. Dupuy was assigned to work for Clay's successor, Martin Van Buren, who paid her wages like a free laborer. The court ultimately ruled against Dupuy and she was returned to Clay in Kentucky. He finally freed her and her daughter ten years later, and her grown son later still.|$|E
25|$|While the mutants demand {{desegregation}} {{and equal}} rights from Mayor Poopenmeyer, Astor tries {{to force them}} back underground using a wave of sewage held in Madison Cube Garden, but Fry uses the 's energy to part the wave and defend the mutants. He shows the mayor and Astor the Land Titanic passenger manifest, which includes Leela's maternal grandmother, {{who worked on the}} Land Titanic when it sunk.

The widowed Astor is moved and urges Mayor Poopenmeyer to support mutant equality. As he and Leela kiss over their victory, Fry's grotesque form melts away, revealing itself to be Astor's mutated husband who fell into the toxic lake and survived as the Land Titanic sunk; Fry had unknowingly lodged himself in the mutant's mouth. The Astors happily reunite, and the Planet Express crew throw another party in celebration together with Leela's family, who are now allowed access to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Kathy Dunderdale {{was sworn}} in as the tenth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador on December 3, 2010, {{following}} the resignation of Williams. She became the first woman in the province to hold the post and only the sixth woman in Canada to become premier. Although she had stated she would not seek the leadership of the party Dunderdale announced on December 30, 2010, that she was entering the leadership race with the backing of her entire caucus. She was the only eligible candidate to seek the leadership and {{was sworn in}} as party leader on April 2, 2011. Later that year Dunderdale led the Progressive Conservatives to their third consecutive victory in the provincial election. Despite a drop in support from the previous election the PC Party elected 37 MHAs and won 56 percent of the popular vote. The development of the Muskrat Falls project, along with other natural resource developments, and the reining in of public spending dominated her time as premier. As well Dunderdale faced many questions about her leadership and communication skills as public support <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> government declined significantly during her three years in office.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} relatively positive {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] Amanda Tyler of USA Today commented: [...] "Lords' story of personal redemption is so immersed in genuine emotion and beaming with soulful resiliency that the reader will walk away with nothing but respect <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> remarkable journey." [...] Bill Zwecker, who reviewed the book for Chicago Sun-Times, noted: [...] "'Graphic' {{is said to be}} quite the understatement for the memoirs former under-age porn star Traci Lords has penned."

500|$|At {{the time}} the episode was being written, Paul McCartney was the only living member of The Beatles who had never {{appeared}} on The Simpsons.

The staff wanted to bring McCartney onto the show, and David Mirkin thought [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] would be an attractive story, since McCartney is a vegetarian himself. McCartney agreed to appear, but requested that Lisa remain a vegetarian {{for the rest of}} the series, rather than revert to meat-eating in the next episode. The staff promised that she would remain a vegetarian, resulting in one of the few permanent character changes made in the show. McCartney's wife Linda was also recruited to appear in the episode. She told Entertainment Weekly that the episode was a chance <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> husband [...] "to spread the vegetarian word to a wider audience".
