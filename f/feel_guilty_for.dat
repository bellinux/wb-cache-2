5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> the consequences.|$|E
25|$|Among {{victims who}} are still living with their {{perpetrators}} high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. Depression is also common, as victims are made to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> ‘provoking’ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and {{it is suggested that}} many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} Something Ain't Kosher Here: The Rise of the [...] "Jewish" [...] Sitcom, Vincent Brook {{analysed}} the episode, saying, [...] "Jerry {{is made to}} <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> his 'lethal' pony remark, whence the episode's macabre humor; yet the moral in terms of ethno-spatial identity is clear. In its violent rejection of Manya, Seinfeld has driven descent-based ethnicities (and their legacy of privation and self-sacrifice) {{off the face of}} the earth, and literally off the air. There is no place for traditional Jewishness in the hedonistic Seinfeld world, [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] vociferously proclaims." ...|$|E

500|$|Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is {{exhausted}} by his extra-curricular activities, so Terri gives him pseudoephedrine tablets, which Finn shares {{with the rest}} of the males in the glee club. The effects of the tablets enhance their performance, and they give an energetic mash-up of [...] "It's My Life and [...] "Confessions Part II". When Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) tells the girls the secret behind the boys' performance, they, too, request the tablets from Terri, and give a high-spirited mash-up of [...] "Halo" [...] and [...] "Walking On Sunshine". Finn and Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> cheating, however, and agree to nullify the competition. When Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) learns what has happened, he fires Terri and, angry with Will, appoints Sue as co-director of the glee club.|$|E
500|$|As such, the FCC representatives {{start to}} censor any foul {{language}} and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining their times of privacy; for instance, a black [...] "censor's bar" [...] is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees {{as he leaves}} the shower, all expletives are overdubbed with an air horn, and audible farts are banned in public (replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines). Everyone in Quahog is angered by this, except for Lois, who approves of the FCC's actions, believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency. However, she realizes that the FCC's presence puts her and Peter's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex, even if no one's watching (specifically banning thrusting, tongue-kissing, moaning and any movement whatsoever). Peter angrily blames her, thus causing her to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> letting this happen. They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed. At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter honorably retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it, such as the Capitol Building to a breast. The oppression of the FCC is finally gone, Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks, and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The Brady Bunch that features bathroom jokes.|$|E
2500|$|Newsweek critic Peter Plagens defended {{motorcycles}} as art {{by arguing}} that, [...] "Just as aerodynamic airplanes are simple and streamlined, a motorcycle--which manages to balance an engine and a seat between two wheels--has a mechanical integrity, with intertwining pipes, chains and springs, that is fascinating to behold," [...] comparing the aesthetic to the modernist, minimalist sculptures of Brâncuși. [...] Patrons need not <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> enjoying themselves, {{because not all}} visits to a museum must be endured as grim ordeals of self-improvement.|$|E

2500|$|Lucas and Peyton {{have been}} {{referred}} to as star-crossed. Schwahn described the theme of their relationship as [...] "two kids that carry around {{the weight of the world}} quite a bit. Can they agree together to let go of that weight? The theme for Lucas and Peyton is, 'How do you learn to be happy when you've spent so much time carrying grief around? Do you <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> being happy? Is it OK to let it go? The couple was also given theme music to enhance the scenes where Lucas rescues Peyton (from despair, dangerous situations, or herself). The theme, titled [...] "Saving Peyton", was composed by John Nordstrom and first heard in the school shooting episode [...] "With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept", in which Lucas strives to save a dying Peyton.|$|E

2500|$|... was an eighteen-year-old {{castrated}} {{boy that}} served as Iason's former Furniture, Riki's caretaker and {{was responsible for the}} household chores. Like all Furnitures in Tanagura, Daryl was raised in Ceres at the orphanage, Guardian, along with Riki. Despite being three years older than Riki and having never met him in Guardian, Daryl knew Riki by his reputation and admired him. Daryl loved him because of his pride and his will not to bow down, which continued when Daryl met Riki again when he first came to Tanagura. As Riki's caretaker, Daryl tried his best effort to look after Riki, much to Riki's annoyance, while still maintaining his distance. Although Riki never treated with Daryl with a lot of respect, he found a comfortable companion in Daryl, who was dutiful, kind, and taught him the rules of Tanagura. Like Katze, Daryl was skilled at hacking, and used this talent to hack Eos Tower's security system to help Riki escape. Having aided an escape attempt and hacking Tanagura's system, he is executed for his crimes; however, Daryl did not regret his actions, as he was happy that Riki was still himself. Although most of Eos Tower knows of Daryl's fate, Riki never knew that Daryl tried to helped him or that he was killed for his actions. Knowing that Riki will <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> Daryl's death and would keep Daryl's memory in his heart, Iason kept Riki in the dark and told him that Daryl was replaced by Cal due to rearrangement with the Furnitures. In the first drama CD, Daryl is voiced by Ryōtarō Okiayu and by [...] in the later drama CDs and remake OVAs.|$|E

2500|$|Altering {{the method}} {{in which the}} murder was committed. In the novel, Lady Westholme used a lethal dose of {{digitalis}} {{under the guise of}} an inconspicuous Arab servant to commit the murder. In the adaptation, the plan is much more elaborate. First, Dame Celia injects Lady Boynton with a drug that would slowly paralyse her, doing so under the pretense of swatting away a hornet. Dr Gerard drops a dead one and pretends to kill it to verify the fact that Lady Boynton had, indeed, been stung. While Lady Boynton sits atop her platform enjoying the sun, she slowly becomes immobile. Dr Gerard, who had injected himself with a drug that would simulate the symptoms of malaria beforehand, returns to the dig with Jinny to rest. Instead, he drugs Jinny and disguises himself as an Arab to plant a wax ball filled with the blood of a goat that he had killed under the clothes of Lady Boynton. That way, as the sun melted the wax, the blood would make it seem as if she were already dead. When Lord Boynton discovered his wife, Dame Celia went to [...] "check" [...] the body – in reality, she quickly stabbed the woman dead in front of everyone before Dr King could examine her. In this way, neither Dr Gerard nor Dame Celia could have been implicated in the crime as neither apparently would have been seen to {{have had the opportunity to}} commit it. Later, when Nanny Taylor has a mental breakdown, Dr Gerard gives her mind-altering drugs and drives her to suicide after forcing her to relive her past, making her <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>for</b> delivering the beatings and punishments that Lady Boynton had ordered for her children. After Poirot explains the truth, Gerard injects Dame Celia and then himself with a fatal dose of digitoxin.|$|E

If every rich man withdrew from the system, the working class and socialists would keep it going, every man in the hope of getting rich himself at last. It's the people that are wrong. They want the system much more than the rich do--because they are much more anxious to be rich--never having been rich, poor devils.|$|E
6000|$|... "And really it's a {{great relief}} to think he's going, Hastings," [...] {{continued}} my honest friend.

The fact is, we've treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I don't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did. Still, there it is, {{we were in the}} wrong, and now there's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole thing's damned awkward! And I'm thankful he's had the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He's welcome to her money." ...|$|E
