25|$|Dufferin was 108.0 ft (length from <b>fore</b> <b>part</b> of stem, {{under the}} bowsprit, to the aft {{side of the}} head of the stern post), 25.0 ft (main breadth to outside of plating), 8.6 ft (depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling at midships), and 28.0 ft (length of engine room). Dufferin had a gross tonnage of 210.57 and a {{registered}} tonnage of 98.93. She was equipped with a Scottish compound surface condensing engine 0.20 Cylinder. 15” & 32” – 24” 42 N.H.P. (nominal horsepower). Additionally, Dufferin had two masts with auxiliary schooner rigging to supplement the steam engine. Furthermore, she had wooden framework with a carvel build, and a elliptical stern.|$|E
25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her <b>fore</b> <b>part</b> was sunk very deep, and we watched her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E

50|$|When disturbed, hooded scaly-foot {{raise their}} heads and <b>fore</b> <b>parts</b> of their bodies from the ground, flatten their necks, and flicker their tongues, {{occasionally}} striking out. The species does this in apparent mimicry of venomous snakes, to deter predators. The markings on the hooded scaly-foot resemble those of young brown snakes. When grasped, they struggle fiercely, rotating their bodies and uttering long squeaking sounds. They readily shed their tails and will regenerate a new one. The regenerating tail can be identified through a change in scale arrangement and pattern.|$|R

25|$|Mediator sailed for Barbados {{towards the}} end of the 1785 {{hurricane}} season, but was becalmed off La Désirade for a night. The following day she was struck by a sudden squall that laid her on her beam ends. Further damage occurred when A terrible crash took part in the <b>fore</b> <b>part</b> of the ship, accompanied by a tremendous explosion and stench of sulphur, deep groans followed, - sixteen men upon the main deck were knocked down, some were apparently dead and others groaning; relief was instantly afforded, and in about four hours after all were apparently well again. A lightning ball had struck the fore topmast, passed into the pigsty, and through the galley into the waist, where it burst and overthrew seventeen men; eleven pigs in the sty before the mast were killed, belonging to the Captain; the silver buckles in the shoes of the gunner were melted into wire, and himself was knocked out of the roundhouse forward. Despite the dramatic nature of the lightning strike, no one was killed, except for the pigs, which Collingwood gave to the crew as a reward for their work in repairing the foremast. Collingwood took Mediator back to English Harbour to be careened in early 1786, and then returned to England to be paid off in August 1786.|$|E

At the same time, they may attempt {{to back away from}} the threat towards cover. They may strike suddenly and fast, to the side as easily as forwards, before returning quickly to the defensive position, ready to strike again. During a strike, the force of the impact is so strong, and the long fangs penetrate so deeply, that prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone. The fangs apparently can penetrate soft leather.|$|E
