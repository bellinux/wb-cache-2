40|$|Critics pay little {{attention}} to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death in Gulliver’s Travels. This paper aims {{to deal with the}} issue with Freud’s theory. According to Freud, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death results in death drive. In Gulliver’s Travels, the episodes of the Struldbruggs and the Houyhnhnms reveal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death. In the episode <b>of</b> Struldbruggs, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is illustrated through <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss cause the Struldbruggs to long for physical death to end emotional death. In the episode <b>of</b> Houyhnhnms, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is represented by <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy is expressed in Houyhnhnms’ cold attitudes to their friends and their family members...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2003 {{study of}} 167 women and 121 men, aged 65–87, low self-efficacy {{predicted}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the unknown after death and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> dying {{for women and}} men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> death was measured by a [...] "Multidimensional <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Death Scale" [...] which included the 8 subscales <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Dying, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Being Destroyed, <b>Fear</b> for Significant Others, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> the Unknown, <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Conscious Death, <b>Fear</b> for the Body After Death, and <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Premature Death. In hierarchical multiple regression analysis the most potent predictors <b>of</b> death <b>fears</b> were low [...] "spiritual health efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low [...] "instrumental efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.|$|R

5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to the <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> many fans, the Glazers {{took action}} {{to ensure that}} Gill and veteran manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{remained}} at Manchester United, citing the duo's success with the club.

5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. <b>Fears</b> <b>of</b> possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai {{was reported to be}} left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took advantage of this program.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> falling {{has been}} {{reported}} in a high percentage of community-dwelling elderly who both do and don't have a history of falling. The aims of this review are to: (a) elucidate the definition <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling; (b) clarify measurements <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling based on its definition; and (c) describe the risk factors for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling. Despite the importance of the percentage and the consequences <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling, its definition is still vague and warrants clarification. Based on a literature review, major <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling measurements involve the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling and use of a fall efficacy scale. Using a correct definition <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling, nurses working close with older adults need to identify the different definitions <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling and fall efficacy scale. In addition, nurses who work closely with older adults should encourage them to increase or maintain modifiable factors by maximizing their basic health status and enhancing their physical activity to decrease <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling...|$|R
50|$|Other {{conditions}} <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> or aversion {{associated with}} age groups {{have their own}} names, particularly: paedophobia, the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> infants and children; ephebiphobia, the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth, sometimes {{also referred to as}} an irrational <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers; and gerontophobia, the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> elderly people.|$|R
2500|$|Death {{anxiety is}} multidimensional; it covers [...] "fears related to one's own death, the death <b>of</b> others, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the unknown after death, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> obliteration, and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the dying process, which {{includes}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> a slow death and a painful death".|$|R
5|$|Despite briefly {{being locked}} out of Boothferry Park by bailiffs and facing the {{possibility}} of liquidation, Hull qualified for the Third Division play-offs in the 2000–01 season, losing in the semi-finals to Leyton Orient. A boardroom takeover by former Leeds United commercial director Adam Pearson had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> closure were banished.|$|E
5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> {{a terrorist}} attack, security measures during the summit were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the}} world gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W.

5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> a sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, {{with the situation}} becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to fulfil certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
40|$|Criminologists have {{indicated}} that gender {{is one of the}} strongest predictors <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime. The leading explanation for gender differences in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime levels is the shadow of sexual assault hypothesis, claiming that women’s <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault {{is one of the most}} salient factors influencing their <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> other crimes. Using a sample of 1, 051 university students, this study examines the predictors <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime in Sweden by testing the shadow of sexual assault hypothesis. Like the work of Ferraro, the current study suggests that the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault shadows the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> other offenses, especially crimes that involve face-to-face contact between victims and offenders. Across all models, perceived risk is a consistent predictor <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime among university students...|$|R
50|$|Women's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime {{refers to}} women's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> {{being a victim}} of crime, {{independent}} of actual victimization. Although <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime is a concern for people of all genders, studies consistently find that {{women around the world}} tend to have much higher levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime than men, despite the fact that in many places, and for most offenses, men's actual victimization rates are higher. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> crime is related to perceived risk of victimization, but is not the same; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime may be generalized instead of referring to specific offenses, and perceived risk may also be considered a demographic factor that contributes to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime. Women tend to have higher levels for both perceived risk and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime.|$|R
5000|$|Several space-related phobias {{have been}} identified, {{including}} agoraphobia (the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> open spaces), [...] (the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> celestial space) and claustrophobia (the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> enclosed spaces).|$|R
5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|He married wife Judy on 4 October 1987; {{the two had}} {{met when}} Whiteside was 16 and she was 20. The {{relationship}} blossomed despite <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> reprisal on Shankill, with him being a Protestant and Judy being a Catholic. The marriage ended acrimoniously in 2001, after the couple had 20 years together and three children: Della, Blaine and Clodagh. He subsequently married Denise.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> an Ottoman attack rose {{after the}} fall of Candia, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited Antonio Maurizio Valperga, the military engineer of the House of Savoy, to improve Malta's fortifications. Valperga designed a new fort to be built on the headland, and despite some criticism from within the order, the decision was eventually approved. The Florentine knight Fra Giovanni Francesco Ricasoli donated 20,000 scudi to construct the fort, and it was named in his honour.|$|E
5000|$|Pornophobia, from Greek roots pornē, [...] "whore" [...] and , {{literally}} means <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> prostitutes. It {{may also}} refer to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> sexual expression, in particular, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> pornography.|$|R
50|$|Most {{people suffer}} from a form <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> medical {{procedures}} during their life.

5000|$|The <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> youth, {{along with}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> street {{culture and the}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> crime, {{is said to have}} been in Western culture for [...] "time immemorial".
