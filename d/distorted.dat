5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a <b>distorted</b> picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This <b>distorted</b> evidence is then communicated and applied in a <b>distorted</b> fashion.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distorted</b> {{perspectives}} of anamorphosis have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when Hans Holbein the Younger incorporated a severely <b>distorted</b> skull in his 1553 painting The Ambassadors. Many artists since then, including Escher, have {{make use of}} anamorphic tricks.|$|E

5000|$|Formed by Greg Below, (concert {{promoter}} {{and owner}} of <b>Distort</b> Productions) and Mitch Joel, (music journalist and publicist) in early 2002, <b>Distort</b> began by producing New Jersey's Step Kings' third release, 3 The Hard Way. The label's slogan [...] "Listen Harder" [...] was soon formed and showed <b>Distort's</b> specialization in heavy music.|$|R
50|$|Similarly named, <b>Distort</b> Productions also {{owned by}} Below, is a concert {{promotion}} company {{which is known}} for bringing acts like Slipknot and System Of A Down to Canada. Acourding to an interview with Mitch Joel, <b>Distort</b> Entertainment's name was derived from <b>Distort</b> Productions, which was already established prior to Joel and Below becoming partners.|$|R
5|$|Ghosts I–IV {{features}} a wide assortment of musical instruments, including piano, guitar, bass, synthesizer, marimba, tambourine, banjo, dulcimer, and xylophone, {{many of which}} were sampled and <b>distorted</b> electronically. Percussion instruments, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and household items.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, <b>distorted</b> electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.|$|E
5|$|Industrial metal is {{the fusion}} of heavy metal music and {{industrial}} music, typically employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and <b>distorted</b> vocals. Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, and Rammstein.|$|E
2500|$|Many guitarists prefer using valve {{amplifiers}} to solid-state models, often {{due to the}} {{way they}} tend to <b>distort</b> when overdriven. (Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to <b>distort</b> the signal. Different circuits will <b>distort</b> the signal in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes.) Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distort</b> Inc. {{specializes in}} heavy music, hardcore, and post-hardcore. Located in Toronto Ontario, <b>Distort</b> Entertainment {{is well known}} for its {{influence}} in the underground music market. Some artists and groups currently or once represented by the label are: Alexisonfire, Cancer Bats, Comeback Kid, Johnny Truant, ArchitectsStep Kings, and The Bronx. Below has in recent years started a sister division, <b>Distort</b> Light, in order to include bands like Bend Sinister.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced.

5|$|At room temperature, {{protactinium}} crystallizes in the body-centered tetragonal structure {{which can}} be regarded as <b>distorted</b> body-centered cubic lattice; this structure does not change upon compression up to 53 GPa. The structure changes to face-centered cubic (fcc) upon cooling from high temperature, at about 1200°C. The thermal expansion coefficient of the tetragonal phase between room temperature and 700°C is 9.9/°C.|$|E
5|$|Boris and Zeanah (1999), {{have offered}} an {{approach}} to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those {{where there is a}} <b>distorted</b> relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a specified attachment figure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Distort</b> Entertainment is a Canadian {{independent}} {{record label}} based in Toronto, Ontario. The label specializes in bands performing hardcore punk-derived music, including Alexisonfire, Cancer Bats and Johnny Truant, but its sister division <b>Distort</b> Light has also released less aggressive rock bands such as Bend Sinister.|$|R
40|$|We use {{stochastic}} population {{models to}} study the evolution of <b>distorting</b> gene complexes. <b>Distorting</b> gene complexes, or distorters, are chromosomal regions characterized by meiotic drive: a heterozygote bearing the distorter passes it to more than 50 % of offspring. Homozygotes bearing the <b>distorting</b> complex are sterile. Although distorters promote themselves {{at the expense of}} other genes in the same genome, they have been successful in evolution: <b>distorting</b> gene complexes have been observed in animal, plant and fungal species. While the molecular drive mechanisms differ, <b>distorting</b> gene complexes exhibit similar genetic features, suggesting that the population genetic mechanisms that allow such gene complexes to evolve may be shared. We investigate such possible mechanisms in the current work. We present Markov models and Monte Carlo simulations of genetic drift in populations of <b>distorting</b> gene complexes. Genetic drift, the stochastic behavior of allele frequencies in small populations, is a fundamental force in the process of evolution, yet the role of genetic drift in the evolution of distorters is not well understood. Our analysis shows how distorters evolve different characteristics in species typified by small and large populations, respectively. We apply our results to two well studied distoring gene complexes: the t-haplotype in Mus musculus and Segregation Distorter in Drosophila melanogaster. ...|$|R

In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors.
