500|$|Wittman {{had sent}} a letter to a number of ceramists in the U.S. {{inviting}} them to participate in the workshop, and asked Norm Schulman, [...] the pottery instructor at the museum school, to facilitate the arrangements. [...] The eight attendees in addition to Littleton and Schulman were: Dominick Labino (then director of research for Johns Manville Corporation), Clayton Bailey, who was Littleton's graduate assistant from the University of Wisconsin, [...] Tom McGlauchlin from the University of Iowa (who had been Littleton’s graduate assistant at Wisconsin the previous year), Karl Martz from Indiana University, John Stephenson from the University of Michigan, William Pitney from Wayne State University, artist Dora Reynolds, and Edith Franklin, one of Schulman's ceramics students. [...] Littleton provided a small pot furnace he had built. [...] In the first couple of days, the participants spent much of the time trying to find a workable glass formula and getting batches of glass melted, leaving very little time to experiment with actual blowing. [...] Labino suggested converting the furnace to a <b>day</b> <b>tank,</b> which would have a larger capacity, and provided some borosilicate marbles to melt instead of mixing a formula. This glass proved easy to work for glass blowing, and the workshop participants experimented with it in shifts {{for the remainder of the}} week. [...] On the final day of the workshop, Harvey Leafgreen, a retired glassblower from the Libbey glass plant in Toledo, happened in to see the public display of the workshop products, and presented an unexpected two-hour demonstration of the craft.|$|E
2500|$|Vapour-compression {{distillers}} {{were installed}} on US submarines shortly before World War 2. Early attempts {{had been made}} with evaporators running from diesel engine exhaust heat, but these could only be used when the submarine was running at speed on the surface. A further difficulty with submarines was the need to produce high-quality water for topping up their large storage batteries. Typical consumption on a war patrol was around [...] per day for hotel services, drinking, cooking, washing etc. and also for replenishing the diesel engine cooling system. A further 500gallons per week was required for the batteries. The standard Badger model X-1 for diesel submarines could produce 1,000gallons per <b>day.</b> <b>Tank</b> capacity of 5,600gallons (1,200 of which was battery water) was provided, around 10 days reserve. With the appearance of nuclear submarines and their plentiful electricity supply, even larger plant could be installed. The X-1 plant was designed {{so that it could}} be operated when snorkelling, or even when completely submerged. As the ambient pressure increased when submerged, and thus the boiling point, additional heat was required in these submarine distillers and so they were designed to run with electric heat continuously.|$|E
50|$|Luna is {{equipped}} with various pumps, including a fuel transfer pump, to shift fuel from one fuel tank to another and to a <b>day</b> <b>tank,</b> a bilge and salvage pump, to pump water from the tug and from barges and ships {{in case of an}} emergency, and a fire pump to deliver water to several hydrants for fire-fighting and deck washing. Galley water is delivered by hand pump.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the glass}} batch {{preparation}} and mixing, {{the raw materials}} are transported to the furnace. Soda-lime glass for mass production is melted in gas fired units. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and <b>day</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Erie Water Works is {{the second}} largest {{consumer}} of electricity in Erie after GE Transportation. As {{a result of a}} vulnerability assessment conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, the Sommerheim plant is to receive a new power generation facility to back up its Penelec electrical service. The facility, which will cost $1.2 million, is to consist of two diesel-powered electric generators with a <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> and a bulk storage fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|The pellet fuel is {{delivered}} from the storage facility or the <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> (single stoves) into the combustion chamber. With the heat generated, circuit water is heated in the pellet boiler. In central heating systems {{the hot water}} then runs through the heating circuit. The heat distribution {{is the same as}} other central heating systems. Unlike oil or gas heating, the inclusion of a hot water reservoir is recommended with pellet heating systems to save hot water until it is needed.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{wood chip}} fuel heating systems also pellet fuel is {{delivered}} periodically and automatically from the pellet storage (for central heating systems) or the <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> (for pellet stove) according to {{need in the}} combustion chamber. With the heat generated from the heating circuit water is heated in the boiler of the pellet in pellet central heating systems. The heat distribution {{is the same as}} in other systems, which use water for heat distribution. Unlike for oil or gas heating systems, pellet heating systems demand the integration of a hot water tank in the heating system in order to reduce heat losses.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (<b>day)</b> <b>tanks,</b> metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material <b>day</b> <b>tanks</b> may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling <b>tanks,</b> <b>day</b> <b>tanks,</b> main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|R

50|$|The Air Force {{constructed}} about 24 main {{buildings in}} two LVAFS areas, the Operations and Cantonment Areas. Construction in the Operations Area consisted of four radar towers, four operational buildings, one water pump station, a power building, and five large above-ground fuel tanks. The Cantonment Area contained approximately five dormitories a dispensary, a mess hall, an administration building, an automotive shop, a maintenance shop, a storage building, a recreation building, one underground gasoline storage tank, and one large above-ground fuel oil tank. Each building had a smaller <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> for storage of heating oil. Three septic tanks comprised the sewage treatment system.|$|E
50|$|The next <b>day,</b> <b>Tank,</b> feeling remorseful, goes {{to visit}} B.G. (Raymond St. Jacques), {{the leader of}} the revolutionary group, and his girlfriend Jeannie (Janet MacLachlan), who is Johnny's sister. B.G. and Jeannie are angry that Tank failed to help with the robbery, and Jeannie blames him for Johnny ending up a fugitive. Tank begs B.G. to find him work as a bodyguard, {{pointing}} out that he is broke. But B.G. tells him the committee has decided to expel him from the group due to his drinking and unreliability, noting that they don't have time to run a rehab.|$|E
50|$|The first {{glass batch}} did not melt properly, and the {{stoneware}} crucible that Littleton {{had made to}} hold the molten glass in the furnace broke apart in the intense heat. Labino suggested that they melt the glass directly in the furnace; he then directed {{the conversion of the}} pot furnace into a small <b>day</b> <b>tank.</b> Instead of trying to melt another load of glass batch, Labino re-charged the furnace with the low-melting formula #475 glass marbles that he had developed for Johns-Manville for the production of fiberglass. The marbles, which melted at a relatively low temperature, produced glass that was malleable enough to blow. This enabled the workshop to continue and, with the craft's technique demonstrated by two retired industrial glassblowers, Harvey Leafgreen and Jim Nelson, participants blew glass around the clock.|$|E
50|$|They grew {{up under}} Japanese colonial rule, {{forbidden}} to speak Korean {{or even to}} use their Korean names. When their country was divided after World War II, my mother and her family were trapped in North Korea. In desperation, they hiked for days to the border {{to be picked up}} and were brought back to Seoul. But even there, they lived under dictatorship. For less than a year in the 1960s, (South) Korea enjoyed democracy. My father joined the diplomatic corps. But one <b>day,</b> <b>tanks</b> rolled and a coup d'etat toppled the government, leaving us to grow up in America.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, the {{division}} once again came to Yeltsin's rescue, during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. The stand-off between the Russian Parliament and Yeltsin, {{against the backdrop}} of massive public demonstrations in Moscow against Yeltsin's government, had by the 2 October brought Russia to the brink of civil war. Between 2 and 4 October, the army considered its position. By sunrise of the 4th, they had given their support to Yeltsin. That <b>day,</b> <b>tanks</b> from the Tamanskaya Division opened fire on the Parliament building, where the Parliament's supporters were barricaded. This episode consolidated Yeltsin's power; it was the deadliest street fighting in Moscow since 1917.|$|R
5|$|On 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Drašković {{were held}} in the city against Slobodan Milošević. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that <b>day</b> <b>tanks</b> were {{deployed}} onto the streets to restore order. Further protests {{were held in}} Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections. These protests brought Zoran Đinđić to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who {{did not belong to}} the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.|$|R
50|$|On its {{way from}} Mombasa, Kenya, to Mahé, Seychelles, the vessel was {{captured}} by Somali pirates about 205 {{miles off the coast}} of Kenya on 23 October 2010. It is possible that the FV Golden Wave 305, a pirate-seized South Korean fishing boat that allegedly had been fishing illegally off the Somalian coast, was used in the capture of the MV York. That the York entered service as a mothership for pirate operations was suspected in December 2010, and confirmed in January 2011, when the York was used by pirates to assist taking control of the captured MV Beluga Nomination in the Indian Ocean. The Beluga had run out of its fuel (using apparently the <b>day</b> <b>tank)</b> and was unable to move. Several hours later the York appeared and assisted the captured ship so that the Beluga could resume its course towards Somalia.|$|E
50|$|Aboard Valour {{the three}} pairs of port and {{starboard}} fuel tanks (#'s 4, 5 & 17) were connected by cross-connect lines equipped with isolation valves. The #12 port and starboard wash water tanks were similarly arranged, {{with the addition of}} a smaller secondary cross-over line. These valves were required, by regulation, to be kept closed when underway. Nonetheless, the #5 port and starboard fuel tanks (which were feeding the <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> for the main engines) were left open, and this was a standard practice. During the post-accident dives, it was discovered that the isolation valve between the #4 port and starboard fuel tanks was also left open. In addition, it's probable (but unconfirmed) that the isolation valve on the secondary cross-connect line between the wash water tanks was also left open. The valves are kept closed to prevent hydrostatic balancing between the tanks and to minimize free surface effect, both of which are detrimental to a vessel's stability.|$|E

40|$|A 30 <b>day</b> <b>tank</b> {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to determine the optimal dietary ration for large (initial size and length, 1. 7 kg, 54. 27 cm) two-year-old mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) grown in seawater during winter (July-August, water temperature 17. 01 – 20. 58 °C). Mulloway fed at 0. 6 % body weight (BW) day- 1 were underfed while feeding at 1. 0 % BW day- 1 produced significant wastage, with up to 25 % of the weekly ration uneaten. Differences in growth were also evident; fish fed at 0. 8 and 1. 0 % BW day- 1 grew significantly faster (SGR, 0. 33 and 0. 34 % day- 1, respectively) than 0. 6 % BW day- 1 (SGR, 0. 23 % day- 1). Mulloway fed at 0. 8 % BW day- 1 had the highest condition index (1. 14), feed conversion efficiency (78. 6 %) with minimal wastage (0. 31 - 2. 1 % of weekly ration un-eaten). The {{results of this study}} suggest that using a feeding rate of 0. 8 % BW day- 1 has the potential to maximize growth, reduce feed wastage and lower costs of mulloway production...|$|E
