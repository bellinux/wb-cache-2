5|$|While Aldimir was {{nominally}} {{loyal to}} Theodore Svetoslav, {{the presence of}} Smiltsena and Ivan at his court would have been seen by the Bulgarian emperor as a threat. In addition, Aldimir perhaps harboured a desire to accede to the throne himself. After Theodore Svetoslav's victory over Byzantium at Skafida in 1304, the Byzantines approached Aldimir with a proposal for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. Aldimir initially remained adamant and was hostile to the Byzantine forces which entered his domain in 1305. However, {{by the end of}} that year Aldimir had switched sides to the Byzantines, as Theodore Svetoslav took back the fortresses that he had granted to Aldimir. Shortly thereafter, Theodore Svetoslav restored his <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> over Kran by reconquering and annexing the appanage.|$|E

GKN Driveline also supplies the all-wheel drive system for the Standard Driveline thus replacing the Haldex system.|$|E
40|$|The power graph P(G) {{of a group}} G is {{the graph}} whose vertex set is G, with x and y joined if one is a power of the other; the <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph P⃗(G) has the same vertex set, with an arc from x to y if y is a power of x. It is known that, for finite groups, the power graph determines the <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph up to {{isomorphism}}. However, {{it is not true}} that any isomorphism between power graphs induces an isomorphism between <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graphs. Moreover, for infinite groups the power graph may fail to determine the <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph. In this paper, we consider power graphs of torsion-free groups. Our main results are that, for torsion-free nilpotent groups of class at most 2, and for groups in which every non-identity element lies in a unique maximal cyclic subgroup, the power graph determines the <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph up to isomorphism. For specific groups such as Z and Q, we obtain more precise results. Any isomorphism P(Z) → P(G) preserves orientation, so induces an isomorphism between <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graphs; in the case of Q, the orientations are either all preserved or all reversed. We also obtain results about groups in which every element is contained in a unique maximal cyclic subgroup (this class includes the free and free abelian groups), and about subgroups of the additive group of Q and about Q^n...|$|R

In this paper, we continue their work and we determine a non-cyclic nilpotent group of an odd order $ n $ whose <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph has the maximum number of undirected edges among all non-cyclic nilpotent groups of order $n$. We next determine non-cyclic $p$-groups whose undirected power graphs have the maximum number of edges among all groups of the same order. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{perceived}} main attractions of a fixed gear bicycle is low weight. Without the added parts required for a fully geared drive train—derailleurs, shifters, cables, cable carriers, multiple chain rings, freewheel hub, brazed-on mounting lugs—a fixed gear bicycle weighs less than its geared equivalent. The chain itself is subject to less sideways force and will not wear out as fast as on a derailleur system. Also, a fixed gear drivetrain is more mechanically efficient than any other bicycle drivetrain, with the most <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> transfer from rider to the wheels. Thus, a fixed gear requires less energy in any given gear to move than a geared bike in the same gear.|$|E
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized battery voltage (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|E

At the same time, one of Sa'id al-Dawla's brothers, Abu'l-Hayja, fled, disguised as a woman, to the Byzantine court. Lu'lu' was a capable ruler who maintained the balance between Byzantium and the Fatimids, but after his death in 1008/9 Aleppo gravitated increasingly towards the latter. A Hamdanid restoration attempt, led by Abu'l-Hayja, failed, and in 1015/6 Mansur ibn Lu'lu' was in turn deposed, ending the last vestiges of the Hamdanid rule in Aleppo.|$|E
40|$|The <b>directed</b> <b>power</b> graph {{of a group}} G is the digraph with vertex set G, {{having an}} arc from y to x {{whenever}} x is a power of y; the undirected power graph has an edge joining x and y whenever one is a power of the other.

As Emir of Aleppo, Lu'lu' was a capable ruler, who was remembered for his wisdom and justice. He also managed to maintain the balance between Byzantium and the Fatimids: although he recognized Fatimid suzerainty, he continued to pay tribute to Byzantium, and imprisoned the adventurer al-Asfar, who dreamed of launching jihad against the Byzantine Empire. Lu'lu' died in 1008/9, and was succeeded by his son Mansur. Mansur was unpopular, faced several challenges to his rule by rival factions and tribes, and quickly became subordinate to the Fatimids. In the end, he was deposed by a popular uprising in 1015/16 and forced to find refuge in Byzantine territory.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelflæd's {{relations}} with the Welsh. The only recorded event took place in 916, when she sent an expedition to avenge {{the murder of a}} Mercian abbot and his companions; her men destroyed the royal crannog of Brycheiniog on Llangorse Lake and captured the queen and thirty-three of her companions.

Hywel Dda was king of Dyfed in south-west Wales, Clydog ap Cadell probably king of Powys in the north-east, and Idwal ab Anarawd king of Gwynedd in the north-west. Gwent in south-east Wales was already under West Saxon lordship but, in the view of Charles-Edwards, this passage shows that the other Welsh kingdoms were under Mercian lordship until Edward took <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> over Mercia.|$|E

60|$|A fatalist {{believes}}, or half believes (for {{nobody is}} a consistent fatalist), {{not only that}} whatever {{is about to happen}} will be the infallible result of the causes which produce it (which is the true necessitarian doctrine), but moreover that there is no use in struggling against it; that it will happen, however we may strive to prevent it. Now, a necessitarian, believing that our actions follow from our characters, and that our characters follow from our organization, our education, and our circumstances, is apt to be, with more or less of consciousness on his part, a fatalist as to his own actions, and to believe that his nature is such, or that his education and circumstances have so moulded his character, that nothing can now prevent him from feeling and acting in a particular way, or at least that no effort of his own can hinder it. In the words of the sect which in our own day has most perseveringly inculcated and most perversely misunderstood this great doctrine, his character is formed for him, and not by him; therefore his wishing that it had been formed differently is of no use; he has no power to alter it. But this is a grand error. He has, to a certain extent, a power to alter his character. Its being, in the ultimate resort, formed for him, is not inconsistent with its being, in part, formed by him as one of the intermediate agents. His character is formed by his circumstances (including among these his particular organization); but his own desire to mould it in a particular way, is one of those circumstances, and by no means one of the least influential. We can not, indeed, directly will to be different from what we are. But neither did those who are supposed to have formed our characters directly will that we should be what we are. Their will had no <b>direct</b> <b>power</b> except over their own actions. They made us what they did make us, by willing, not the end, but the requisite means; and we, when our habits are not too inveterate, can, by similarly willing the requisite means, make ourselves different. If they could place us under the influence of certain circumstances, we, in like manner, can place ourselves under the influence of other circumstances. We are exactly as capable of making our own character, if we will, as others are of making it for us.|$|E
