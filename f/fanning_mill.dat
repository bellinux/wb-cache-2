Twenty acres were dedicated to pasture, half an acre for gardening/orchard, eight for wheat, two acres for potatoes and around 60 acres for hay. The land also had one house, two barns, three carriages, four carts, six ploughs one reaper, one horse rack and one <b>fanning</b> <b>mill.</b> That year the crop yields consisted of 75 bushels of wheat, 150 bushels of barley, 300 bushels of oats, five bushels of beans, 200 bushels of potatoes, 40 bushels of turnips, 10 bushels of beets, 35 bushels of carrots, six bushels of pears/plums and 80 tons of hay. The livestock on the land consisted of nine horses/colts, eight milk cows, 13 cattle, 18 sheep, 13 swine and three beehives.

50|$|When seed {{is first}} {{separated}} from cones it {{is mixed with}} foreign matter, often 2 to 5 times {{the volume of the}} seed. The more or less firmly attached membranous wings on the seed must be detached before it is cleaned of foreign matter. The testa must not incur damage during the dewinging process. Two methods have been used, dry and wet. Dry seed may be rubbed gently through a sieve that has a mesh through which only seed without wings can pass. Large quantities of seed can be processed in dewinging machines, which use cylinders of heavy wire mesh and rapidly revolving stiff brushes within to remove the wings. In the wet process, seed with wings attached are spread out 10 cm to 15 cm deep on a tight floor and slightly moistened throughout; light leather flails are used to free seed from the wings. Wang (1973) described a unique wet dewinging procedure using a cement mixer, used at the Petawawa tree seed processing facility. Wings of white and Norway spruce seed can be removed by dampening the seed slightly before it is run through a <b>fanning</b> <b>mill</b> for the last time. Any moistened seed must be dried before fermentation or moulding sets in.|$|E

This paper studies heat transfer coefficient of water-cooled furnace smoke pipe at different flow rate and flue gas temperature though a established water-cooled furnace smoke pipe test bed.

50|$|The growing {{agricultural}} activity in southern Ontario and Quebec provided {{the basis for}} farm mechanization and the manufacturing industry to meet the demand for agricultural machinery. The area around Hamilton had become attractive for iron and steel industries based on railway construction and the source of this raw material made the same area attractive to aspiring farm implement manufacturers. By about 1850 there were factories producing ploughs, mowers, reapers, seed drills, cutting boxes, <b>fanning</b> <b>mills</b> threshing machines and steam engines, established by entrepreneurs including the well known Massey family, Harris, Wisner, Cockshutt, Sawyer, Patterson, Verity and Willkinson.
