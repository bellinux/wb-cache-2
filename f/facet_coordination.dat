40|$|Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menggali model mental dan aspek-aspeknya yang mencakup sistem representasi eksternal, strategi, elemen-elemen kognitif dan struktur pengetahuan dalam physics {{problem solving}}. Kajian naturalistik ini menggunakan pendekatan fenomenografi untuk menganalisis data dari {{individual}} thinking-aloud dan semi-structured interview terhadap 9 siswa, 7 guru fisika, 6 mahasiswa semester I dan 7 mahasiswa semester III dari LPTK, serta 4 mahasiswa program magister. Subyek penelitian ditentukan dengan menggunakan tes seleksi responden, kecuali guru. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan representasi eksternal khususnya diagram pada tahap awal menentukan efektivitas problem solving. Faktor kunci keberhasilan problem solving adalah kesimultanan antara membaca atau memahami masalah, menyusun diagram dan mengidentifikasi variabel yang diketahui dan ditanyakan. Analisis terhadap model mental menunjukkan bahwa model mental responden bergantung pada konteks dan setting dari fenomena yang disajikan. Temuan-temuan penelitian ini menegaskan bahwa sebuah model mental bergantung pada konteks dan dapat diperankan oleh individu secara berbeda pada setting problem solving dan interviu. Beberapa model mental dan perilaku aktivasinya hanya ditemukan dalam setting problem solving. Outcome space untuk soal tipe tradisional menunjukkan bahwa pilihan strategi problem solving dipengaruhi oleh faktor-faktor psikologi seperti beban kognitif dalam working memory, fenomena mind set atau functional fixedness. Strategi-strategi pada pemecahan soal-soal tipe Jeopardy untuk dekonstruksi grafik berbeda dengan dekonstruksi rumus. Elemen-elemen kognitif atau resource yang diidentifikasi yaitu p-prim, <b>facet,</b> <b>coordination</b> class (readout strategy dan causal net), dan mathematical form. Pola aktivasi resource sangat bergantung pada konteks dan kekompleksan fenomena. Koherensi resource yang diaktifkan berbeda antara satu responden dengan responden lainnya untuk domain konsep yang sama. Koherensi struktur pengetahuan dalam konteks integrasi konsep kinematika/dinamika dan usaha-energi menunjukkan bahwa untuk domain konsep yang sama, individu yang berbeda mengkoneksikan dan mengorganisasikan pengetahuannya dengan cara berbeda. Secara umum, kematangan model mental dan aspek-aspeknya bergantung pada level akademik. Kematangan tersebut ditunjukkan oleh dominasi dan konsistensi mahasiswa S 2 dan guru pada model mental yang tepat, dengan sistem representasi eksternal pada tahap awal problem solving dan strategi yang efektif, dekonstruksi soal tipe Jeopardy yang lengkap, koherensi elemen kognitif dan struktur pengetahuan yang tinggi. Transisi expertise dari novice menuju expert dominan berada pada mahasiswa semester III yang telah mengikuti matakuliah Mekanika yang bersifat analitik. Hasil utama disertasi ini adalah konstruksi kerangka kerja teoretik yang berguna untuk penguatan aspek-aspek keilmuan tentang teori model mental dan problem solving. Disarankan kepada pendidik dan peneliti untuk memperhatikan aspek-aspek model mental dan penggunaan pengetahuan untuk meningkatkan hasil-hasil pendidikan. The aims of study are to elicit the subjects’ mental model and its aspects {{that include the}} external representation system, strategies, cognitive elements and knowledge structure in physics problem solving. The naturalistic study was conducted using phenomenographic approach {{to analyze the data}} from the individual thinking-aloud and the semi-structured interview to 9 students and 7 physics teachers from the senior high schools, 6 first and 7 third semester students from the physics education program, and 4 graduate students. The subjects were determined by selection test, except the teachers. Study results show that utilization of the external representation especially the diagram in the initial stages determine the effectiveness of problem solving. The success key factor of the problem solving is simultaneous processes of reading or understanding the problem, constructing diagram, and identifying given and asked variables. Analysis of mental model shows that respondents’ mental models depend on the context and setting of the phenomena displays. Findings of the study emphasize that a mental model differently played by individual in the problem solving interview setting. Several mental models and their activation behaviors are only found in the problem solving setting. Outcome space of traditional problem shows that the choice of respondents’ strategies are influenced by their psychological factors, such as cognitive load in working memory, phenomena of mind set or functional fixedness. The strategies in solving Jeopardy problems of graphical are different from formula deconstruction type. The cognitive elements or resources are identified, i. e: p-prim, <b>facet,</b> <b>coordination</b> class (readout strategy and causal net), and mathematical form. Activation patterns of the resources are very dependent to the context and complexity of phenomena. The coherence of activated resource is different between respondents each other for the same concept domain. Coherence of knowledge structure in the context of kinematic/dynamic and work-energy concepts integration shows that for the same concept domain, the different individuals connected and organized their knowledge with different ways. Generally, the maturation of mental model and its aspects depends on academic level. The maturation is shown by domination and consistency of graduate students and teachers in the appropriate mental models, effective external representation system at initial stages of problem solving and strategy, completed deconstruction of Jeopardy problem, and high coherent cognitive element and knowledge structure. The transition of expertise from novice to expert dominantly occurs at the third semester students that enrolled the analytical Mechanics course. The main results of the dissertation are construction of theoretical framework that useful to strengthen the scientific aspects of the mental model and problem solving theory. It is recommended that the educators and researchers should concern the aspects of mental model and knowledge utilization in order to improve the educational results...|$|E

40|$|We {{show with}} the aid of first-principles {{electronic}} structure calculations that suitable choice of the capping ligands may be an important control parameter for crystal structure engineering of nanoparticles. Our calculations on CdS nanocrystals reveal that the binding energy of model trioctylphosphine molecules on the (001) facets of zincblende nanocrystals is larger compared to that on wurtzite facets. Similarly, the binding energy of model cis-oleic acid is found to be dominant for the (10 (1) over bar 0) facets of wurtzite structure. As a consequence, trioctylphosphine as a capping agent stabilizes the zincblende structure while cis-oleic acid stabilizes the wurtzite phase by influencing the surface energy, which has a sizable contribution to the energetics of a nanocrystal. Our detailed analysis suggests that the binding of molecules on the nanocrystalline facets depends on the surface topology of the <b>facets,</b> the <b>coordination</b> of the surface atoms where the capping molecule is likely to attach, and the conformation of the capping molecule...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} PDA in the meeting environment. Three fundamental design issues are raised: PDA as mobile devices, CSCW devices and coordination devices. The research work described in this paper {{is focused on the}} <b>coordination</b> <b>facet.</b> The paper proposes three levels of detail to characterize meetings as coordination mechanisms and ascertain the role of PDA in that process. The first level identifies meeting agents and roles, as well as the tangible things necessary to support those roles. The second level describes how the tangible things are organized in meetings, highlighting repetitive patterns in meeting processes. Finally, the third level draws the functional requirements of the PDA support to the tangible things. The paper applies the proposed approach to a specific meeting environment, staff briefings, and uses a small consulting company as test bed. The PDA functionality was specified from analyzing how the test bed organization conducted staff briefings. A prototype was then developed. The test bed organization also produced feedback information on the prototype use. The obtained results indicate a general satisfaction with the functionality and increased enthusiasm with PDA usage in the meeting environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{nanoparticles}} with high-index facets exhibit exceptional electrocatalytic activity {{owing to}} the high density of low coordination sites at the surface, thus they have attracted intense interest {{over the past few}} years. Alloying could further improve their catalytic activity by the synergy effects of high-index facets and electronic structures of components. Using atomistic simulations, we have investigated thermodynamic and shape stabilities of tetrahexahedral Pt-Pd alloy nanoparticles respectively bound by { 210 } and { 310 } facets. Energy minimization through Monte Carlo simulations has indicated that the outermost layer is predominated by Pd atoms while Pt atoms preferentially occupy the sub-outermost layer of nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the heating process have shown that the { 210 } faceted nanoparticles possess better thermodynamic and shape stabilities than the { 310 } <b>faceted</b> ones. The <b>coordination</b> numbers of surface atoms were used to explore the potential origin of the different stabilities. Furthermore, a high Pt ratio will help enhance their stabilities. For both faceted nanoparticles, the melting has homogeneously developed from the surface into the core, and the tetrahexahedra have finally evolved into sphere-like shape prior to the overall melting. These results are helpful for understanding the composition and thermodynamic properties of high-index faceted nanoparticles, and are also of practical importance to the development of alloy nanocatalysts. ? 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{coordination}} of patient’s and therapist’s bodily movement – nonverbal synchrony – has been empirically {{shown to be}} associated with psychotherapy outcome. This finding was based on dynamic movement patterns of the whole body. The present paper is a new analysis of an existing dataset (Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011), which extends previous findings by differentiating movements pertaining to head and upper-body regions. Method: In a sample of 70 patients (37 female, 33 male) treated at an outpatient psychotherapy clinic, we quantified nonverbal synchrony with an automated objective video-analysis algorithm (Motion Energy Analysis, MEA). Head- and body-synchrony was quantified during the initial 15 minutes of video-recorded therapy sessions. Micro-outcome was assessed with self-report post-session questionnaires provided by patients and their therapists. Macro-outcome was measured with questionnaires that quantified attainment of treatment goals and changes in experiencing and behavior at the end of therapy. Results: The differentiation of head- and body-synchrony showed that these two <b>facets</b> of motor <b>coordination</b> were differentially associated with outcome. Head-synchrony predicted global outcome of therapy, while body-synchrony did not, and body-synchrony predicted session outcome, while head-synchrony did not. Conclusions: The results pose an important amendment to previous findings, which showed that nonverbal synchrony embodied both outcome and interpersonal variables of psychotherapy dyads. The separation of head- and body-synchrony suggested that distinct mechanisms may operate in these two regions: Head-synchrony embodied phenomena with a long temporal extension (overall therapy success), while body-synchrony embodied phenomena of a more immediate nature (session-level success). More explorations with fine-grained analyses of synchronized phenomena in nonverbal behavior may shed additional light on the embodiment of psychotherapy process...|$|R
40|$|To {{constantly}} add to {{our understanding}} of child development, a valid, comprehensive, well-researched measure is needed. The recent revision and standardisation of the Griffiths Mental Development Scales - Extended Revised (GMDS-ER) has necessitated investigations into its psychometric properties. This measure is used to identify developmental delays in children and critical decisions may be made, hence it is imperative that this measure be deemed both reliable and valid. This study aimed to contribute to the broader restandardisation project and focussed on gathering qualitative and quantitative construct-related validity evidence for one of the six Subscales of the GMDS-ER, namely the Eye and Hand Coordination Subscale (Subscale D). An exploratory descriptive method using a triangulation approach was used to explore the construct-related validity evidence of the Eye and Hand Coordination Subscale. A non-random purposively selected sample of 6 experts, who had worked at least 10 years with children assessing and evaluating the domain of eye-hand coordination, participated in a facet analysis to identify the underlying dimensions tapped by the Eye and Hand Coordination Subscale. The sample for the quantitative aspects of this study, the empirical validation of the construct model, was collected as part of the broader restandardisation and represented a stratified sample of 1026 children between the ages 24 months and 96 months from across the United Kingdom and Eire. Three measures, namely a biographical questionnaire, the GMDS-ER and a construct evaluation form were used to gather the qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data was analysed by means of a facet analysis and literature control which included examining other tests or subtests that tapped eye-hand coordination skills. The quantitative data was analysed by means of exploratory common factor analysis using oblique (DQUART) rotation in order to verify the qualitatively identified construct model by specifying a one-factor solution for each underlying construct. While literature suggests that eye-hand coordination is multidimensional in nature the facet analysis revealed that the tasks tapped by Subscale D were not tapping complex skills aside from eye-hand <b>coordination.</b> The <b>facet</b> analysis thus revealed that all the items tap the eye-hand coordination of fine motor tasks and that these items could be grouped into two categories, using writing utensils and object manipulation. The results from the factor analysis confirmed that the items on Subscale D have one underlying construct and further exploration confirmed that these items could in fact be grouped into two categories. The coefficients of congruence for SES and gender were satisfactory and thus the construct model was validated across these groups as well. The study has provided extensive qualitative and quantitative evidence for the construct-related validity of the Eye and Hand Coordination Subscale of the GMDS-ER, thus validating its use as a sound measure of eye-hand coordination development in children aged 2 to 8 years. The content coverage however, seemed to indicate that the tasks required do not adequately cover all the <b>facets</b> of eye-hand <b>coordination</b> and some of these item types are tapped by the other Subscales in the measure. Hence, should the Subscale be used as an independent assessment of eye-hand coordination, the eye-hand coordination development of the child would have a narrow focus. In addition, in reviewing the variety of tasks in the two sections for the older and younger child, the researcher noted that while section III tapped a variety of skills, section IV only focused on skills associated with drawing, copying and writing. A review of the age appropriateness of the items and the item analysis results from the revision seemed to indicate that some of the items assessing the older child may need to be revised. Further, the researcher suggested that the revision should consider adding additional dimensions to the tasks assessed. Overall, it is the researcher‟s opinion that this Subscale was not given adequate attention during the revision process and should future revisions occur, the recommendations from this study should be considere...|$|R
