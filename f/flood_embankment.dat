40|$|There {{are some}} 35 000 km of estuarine and river <b>flood</b> defence <b>embankments</b> in England and Wales {{with an annual}} budget of {{approximately}} £ 450 million spent on maintenance and new construction. The effective performance of these <b>embankments</b> during extreme <b>flood</b> events is critical for the provision of sustainable flood defences. However <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> can become less effective {{over a period of time}} for a number of reasons such as (a) increased frequency of flooding due to climate change, (b) an increase in the required standard of service or other functional requirements and (c) long-term deterioration from the intended condition - as constructed or maintained. The tendency for earth embankments to deteriorate with time is of particular concern because climate change and the increasing rate of occurrence of extreme events are leading to an increase in loading. This paper reviews the geotechnical factors that can affect the performance of fluvial and estuarine <b>flood</b> defence <b>embankments</b> in the short and long term. The review considers the traditional methods used to construct <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> compared with modern techniques, the type of local materials used for construction, the range of possible geotechnical factors that can lead to a loss of performance and finally case histories of embankment breaches...|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} the Ries Railway has been {{interrupted}} repeatedly by landslides at different points. The longest of these interruptions was at the Bildwasen tunnel between Lauchheim and Aufhausen between December 2002 and December 2003. It affected the tunnel entrance, which has now been extensively renovated. In the same period, from February 2003 to July 2003, a large slip occurred on a <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> between Ebermergen and Donauwörth, bringin traffic on the line almost to a complete halt. These circumstances prompted considerations of closing the track. Before the blocking the route, many trains ran continuously from the Rems Railway to Donauwörth. Since the reopening of the route operations on the Ries Railway are run almost entirely independently.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{idea of an}} expressway on embankment {{has been}} built and is in use in the other countries. For example, in 1964, the United States used a similar idea to address the serious and repetitive flooding problem from its major river Mississippi. After the <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> was approved and built, the land around Mississippi remains one of agriculturally most productive areas of America. There are no instances of poor construction, big holes, sitting water and water borne diseases on the dry side of the embankment. Embankments are usually built, not like a dam, but with periodic gates that allowed controlled amounts of water and silt to flow {{from one side to}} other.|$|E
50|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{took the}} {{initiative}} on September 22. With a force consisting of 2,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, he started his march from Walichnów {{in the direction of}} Gniew under the cover of <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> along the bank of the Vistula. In order to scout out Polish entrenchments he led 900 men (30% of his force), and soon the two sides met. The fighting surged back and forth; winged hussars attacked the German reiters under the command of Heinrich von Thurn who fled into the woods, but were later repulsed by the Swedish infantry, and {{due to the fact that}} the area was traversed by ditches which made it difficult for the hussars to charge. The Poles then sent infantry and three squadrons of light cavalry to the left wing of the Swedes and forced them out of the <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> of which they captured. At the same time two regiments of light cavalry struck the Swedes' flank and scattered them. However, Gustavus rounded up the remainder of his forces and managed to repel the attacking Poles, whom in their rout rode over their own infantry lines.|$|R
40|$|Early {{studies on}} the 1953 North Sea floods showed that {{desiccation}} fissuring of clay fill can {{play a major role}} in the failure of <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> under overflow conditions. However, the onset of desiccation fissuring in embankments and its contribution towards breach initiation has not been fully researched. Field and laboratory studies were thus carried out into the desiccation fissuring of clay <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> in the UK. The work found that a critical condition is reached when desiccation creates an interconnected network of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal fissures, which significantly increases the mass permeability of the fill material and hence allows rapid seepage of flood water through the surface layer of the embankment. It is suggested high rates of seepage cause localised uplifting of clay blocks, leading to progressive slope failure and successive breaching. Small-scale desiccation tests carried out on discs of soil in pressure plates showed very good agreement between the onset of cracking in the pressure plates and the moisture content recorded in the field. This suggests that it is possible to assess the susceptibility of a fill material to desiccation fissuring from the soil water characteristic curve...|$|R
40|$|The {{probability}} of structural failure of flood defences {{is an important}} component in the modelling of <b>flood</b> risk. <b>Flood</b> <b>embankments</b> are a very common type of defence whose reliability assessment shows some problematic aspects. In particular it is difficulty to model the process of piping through the earthfill and, when assessing the safety of an extended flood defence network, a diffuse lack of knowledge (epistemic uncertainty) about some of the characteristics of the structures has to be addressed. This thesis presents a new methodology, named the Reliability Rating System, which makes possible the rapid quantification of the expected performance of <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> in extreme hydraulic conditions. The proposed methodology ranks and compare <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> according to their proneness to breaching using a performance indicator, called the Probability of Breaching in Extreme hydraulic conditions PBE. This performance indicator is related to {{probability of}} structural failure for a limited range of water levels above and immediately below the crest. The Reliability Rating System takes into account three failure modes: breaching initiated by grass cover failure in overtopping conditions, breaching induced by piping through the earthfill (through-piping) and breaching due to piping in the founding soil (under-piping). Credible mathematical models are available for the grass cover failure and under-piping and the probability of breaching induced by these failure modes can be calculated with the methods of reliability analysis. By contrast no credible process based mathematical model is currently available for through-piping. In this work the probabilities of breaching by through-piping have been estimated with a rigorous process of subjective judgement elicitation. In the case of uncertainty on some of the relevant characteristics the final users can rapidly study different possible scenarios thanks to the tabulated solutions presented here. Upper and lower bounds on the performance indicator PBE can be readily determined in order to handle the epistemic uncertainty typical of flood defences safety assessments.

50|$|Fulgazi is a sub-{{district}} of the Feni {{district of}} Bangladesh. It has {{an area of}} 99.03 square kilometers. Prarashuram lies on the north {{on the other hand}} Chagalnaiya is on its south. Fulgazi lies on a flood plain and a fertile land. Since Fulgazi lies on a floodplain, it has water readily available for the irrigation of rice plantations and fish farming. Selonia channel and Muhuri river runs through Fulgazi from India on the north. The climate of Fulgazi is tropical; mild winter (October to March); hot, humid summer (March to June); humid, warm rainy monsoon (June to October). During the summers and monsoon season of Bangladesh, rivers at Fulgazi overflow causing damages to the <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> and rice crops by flooding and making access to Fulgazi difficult by road, resulting in famine. A non functional rail track runs through this sub-district.|$|E
50|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150 km/h (90 mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50 years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24 hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330 million (US$4.4 million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20 cm (7.9 in); Paradip documented 53 cm (20.9 in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60 cm (23.6 in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5 cm (37.60 in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000 people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70% of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10-15% of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000 schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60% of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8 November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005 <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> breaches and the damaging of 6 headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest diammonium phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> breaches on the Tay and Earn river systems, Scotland, {{during a}} 100 -year return period flood in January 1993. The location of <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> breaches are compared with failures mapped during another large flood event in February 1990 and other historical information on <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> instability. Breaches were identified using colour aerial photography taken 10 {{days after the}} January 1993 flood event and a detailed field survey of every <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> breach was subsequently undertaken. In total, 116 breaches resulted from the 1993 flood event, most {{as a result of}} overtopping, and extensive floodplain damage was associated with a number of the failures. Specific sections of the Tay and Earn river systems demonstrated a high incidence of <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> breach-ing. Along these sections, embankments on the outside of bends and overlying old river courses are highly vulnerable to failure. Embankments bordering tributary streams are also vulnerable to failure as a result of being perpendicular to the direction of flow across the floodplain during inundation. A number of failures, however, cannot be attributed irectly to their position relative to the river or former iver courses. In these cases local factors, such as scour around fence-posts or poor <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> construction are probably dominant. Given the repeated breaching of embankments during flood events, changing agricultural land-use practices, and possible changes in flood magnitudes and frequencies, a number of recommendations concerning <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> management on the Tay and Earn river systems are proposed...|$|E

40|$|Flooding is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Over {{the last few}} decades the world has experienced a rising number of devastating flood events and the trend in such natural disasters is increasing. Furthermore, escalations in both the probability and magnitude of flood hazards are expected as a result of climate change. Flood defence embankments are one of the major flood defence measures and reliability assessment for these structures is therefore a very important process. Routine hydro-mechanical models for the stability of flood embankments are based on the assumptions of steady-state through-flow and zero pore-pressures above the phreatic surface, i. e. negative capillary pressure (suction) is ignored. Despite common belief, these assumptions may not always lead to conservative design. In addition, hydraulic loading is stochastic in nature and <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> stability should therefore be assessed in probabilistic terms. This cannot be accommodated by steady-state flow models. The paper presents an approach for reliability analysis of <b>flood</b> <b>embankment</b> taking into account the transient water through-flow. The factor of safety of the embankment is assessed in probabilistic terms based on a stochastic distribution for the hydraulic loading. Two different probabilistic approaches are tested to compare and validate the results...|$|E

40|$|With renewed {{interest}} {{in the performance of}} <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> globally, {{it is important that the}} performance of fills in conditions similar to ‘as-constructed’ are scrutinised. The fill material investigated in this study was sampled from <b>flood</b> <b>embankments</b> located along the Bengawan Solo River in East Java, Indonesia. The recurrent history of overtopping and stability issues in these embankments provided the motivation for developing a better understanding of the behaviour of this compacted fill under different loading and wetting conditions. The site investigation revealed that the embankment fill was compacted at low dry densities and that there was local variation in the dry densities determined. A detailed study highlighted that at low compactive efforts this fill material exhibits an irregular double-peak compaction curve, which can be explained by the tendency of this fill to form aggregates on wetting. To cover different plausible operational conditions of these embankments, saturated and unsaturated compression oedometer tests and one-dimensional collapse tests were performed under different initial conditions. Specimens compacted at conditions similar to ‘as-constructed’ exhibited significant collapse deformation (up to 13. 6 %) on wetting. Evolution of the microstructure during loading and wetting paths was investigated using MIP and ESEM. A physically-based framework proposed by Romero (2013) was used to explain the changes in the macroscale collapse behaviour observed in the oedometer tests based on the evolution of microporosity. Using this model the evolution of the microporosity with dry density and water content was presented. This microstructural approach could be used as a tool for specifying appropriate compaction conditions for earthworks where fill material is susceptible to volumetric collapse...|$|R

Moreover, even in regions where unsaturated conditions are limited to a shallow surface layer; many practical problems in geotechnical engineering (i. e. slope stability, pollutant migrations) are significantly affected by the hydro-mechanical processes occurring in the unsaturated zone. Soil is used extensively as a fill material (i. e. earth-works such as road, railway and <b>flood</b> <b>embankments,</b> earth dams or behind retaining structures) and the unsaturated condition of the fill will crucially affect its behaviour.
