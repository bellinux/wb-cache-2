50|$|The search {{algorithm}} for skip graphs {{is almost}} identical to the search algorithm for skip lists but it is modified to run in a distributed system.

When a greater <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found, the search drops to the next level, continuing until the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found or it is determined that the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not contained in the set of nodes. If the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not contained in the set of nodes the largest value less than the search <b>key</b> <b>is</b> returned.|$|R
