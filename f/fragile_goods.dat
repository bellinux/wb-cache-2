The technical challenges center {{on the development of}} sensors and sensor network infrastructure,including the need to comply with emerging APIs for grid and Web services. Process-driven challenges, which center on the development and adoption of new business models and applications, are driving this technology. This article describes two widely different sensor network applications — emergency medical services and supply chain management — and describes how these applications fit into a new data collection network based on the Hourglass publish–subscribe paradigm. Today’s grid architecture 1 encompasses a far greater breadth of applications than the traditional grid, which focused on distributed applications processing large amounts of data. Newer grid applications are more data-centric and more focused on distributed services. In this article, we discuss emerging grid standards that support these applications, while complying with the Open Grid Services Architecture (OSGA). Much of the data for these newer applications are collected by a new class of small, self-contained, intelligent devices that combine limited sensing and computation capabilities with wireless communications.

40|$|When air-sprung HVs {{were granted}} {{concessions}} to carry greater mass {{at the end}} of the 1990 s, Australian road authorities knew that air-sprung HVs with industry-standard (or conventionally sized) air lines between air springs did not load share in the dynamic sense. It was known at the time that concomitant increases in dynamic wheel loads from air-sprung HV suspensions as a result of ineffective dynamic load sharing had the potential to cause greater road damage than might otherwise be the case should air-sprung HVs have incorporated more dynamic load equalisation into their design (OECD, 1992, 1998). Noting that perfect load equalisation would give a LSC of 1. 0 (Potter, Cebon, Cole, & Collop, 1996) LSC values (Sweatman, 1983) for steel suspensions were documented in the range 0. 791 to 0. 957. Air suspensions were placed somewhere in the middle of this range with LSCs of 0. 904 to 0. 925. This was a decade before, and referenced in, the first OECD report (OECD, 1992). In fine, the effects of poor dynamic load equalisation were published and known at the time of granting air-sprung HVs concessions to carry greater mass {{at the end of}} the 1990 s. With the clarity of hindsight, the disbenefits due to higher road network asset damage may not have been recognised as having the potential to discount the societal and economic benefits of higher HV payloads. Two reports commissioned by the NTC (Estill & Associates Pty Ltd, 2000; Roaduser Systems Pty Ltd, 2002) have recommended, inter alia, evaluations of countermeasures, via testing, which have corrected HV handling problems in air-suspended HVs. The Roaduser report, p 68, recommended tests to assess the effect of installing larger “pipes” or air lines so that, p 31, “longitudinal air flow between axles is increased; this should improve the load-sharing capability of the suspension; in both cases where this was implemented, it was reported to fix the problem” (Roaduser Systems Pty Ltd, 2002). Further, as far back as 2000, the NTC had the recommendation put to it on p 32 of the report by Estill & Associates to “investigate and evaluate ‘after market improvements’ to air suspensions” from installation of “larger diameter pipes to supply and exhaust air flow to the bag quickly and hence improve the response time of the air bag. The modification also reduces the roll and has improved stability. ” (Estill & Associates Pty Ltd, 2000). Since then, the 2005 test programme funded by the Queensland Department of Main Roads (Davis, 2006 b) and the 2007 test programme (Davis, 2007; Davis & Kel, 2007) comprise the only known published testing of HVs with larger longitudinal air lines since those recommendations were made. Previous work (Davis, 2006 b; Davis & Sack, 2004) has shown that RFS do not load share dynamically when in multi-axle groups. That testing, in Feb 2003 (Davis & Sack, 2004), was on a semi-trailer fitted with standard longitudinal air lines (6. 5 mm inside diameter, 9. 5 mm outside diameter). The results showed that the transfer of air between air springs on the test vehicle was in the order of 3 s. Simple logic yields that if the axle spacings on a HV are 1 m apart at their closest (worst case), then at 100 km/h (27. 7 ms- 1) the reaction time for air to start to transfer between air springs as described above needs to be in the order of 1 / 28 s (0. 036 s) for any reasonable dynamic load sharing to occur. This value may be relaxed to about 1 / 21 s (0. 047 s) for axle spacings of 1. 3 m at 100 km/h. Hence, air transfer with time constants in the order of 3 s will not load share dynamically, causing more distress to the road network than the case where air-sprung HVs have a better ability to load-share than the current fleet. Quad-axle semi trailers are being introduced to Australia. If previously the inability of air suspensions to equalise (say) 22. 5 t loads across tri-axle groups resulted in unequal loadings on one axle over another for that group, the emerging scenario will be 27 t similarly imbalanced within a group of 4 axles. Arising from this, road authorities in Australia, officially or otherwise, are becoming increasingly concerned that HVs with air springs are not as sympathetic to the network asset as they might otherwise be. Recent work on tri-axle and quad-axle semi-trailers (Blanksby, George, Peters, Ritzinger, & Bruzsa, 2008) has substantiated that load sharing in air-sprung HVs with conventionally sized air lines does not occur in the dynamic sense, confirming current concerns. Davis and Bunker (Davis & Bunker, 2008 b) described the testing and frequency spectrum analysis of the suspension forces, including the air springs in three HVs. In the results of that study, body-bounce forces predominated in the air spring spectra, regardless of speed. That study also showed that, as speed increased, so did the magnitudes of axle-hop and concomitant wheel forces. Maximum transfer of air from one air spring to its associated rear air spring could be seen to be an ideal situation for load equalisation. However, the practicality of the phenomenon of axle-hop requires that some imperfection needs to be introduced into the transfer mechanism to reduce the possibility of standing waves in the air spring connector exciting sympathetic oscillations in neighbouring air springs. This phenomenon has been modelled and the outputs are presented in this report. Axle inertia combined with suspension damping act to de-couple the pavement frequencies from the chassis. Alternately, another explanation in systems engineering terms is the suspension acts as a low-pass filter, isolating high-frequency road irregularities from the chassis. A result of the suspension design meeting one of its criteria in that the range of frequencies measured for the unsprung masses below the axle is not the same as the resonant body bounce frequencies. This effectively isolates the chassis as much as is possible (and therefore the payload and/or the passengers) from the harshness and vibration due to pavement irregularities. The rationale for work in this field serves both road authorities and the heavy vehicle industry. The benefits of increasing the load sharing ability between consecutive axles have been shown previously in the joint QUT/Main Roads project Heavy vehicle suspensions – testing and analysis. Better load sharing than found on most current HV suspensions would reduce wheel-forces, reduce body vibrations, lower chassis and suspension forces and provide a more comfortable ride for passengers and drivers. The benefits of these measures would be reduced road damage, reduced payload damage (especially for <b>fragile</b> <b>goods)</b> less fatigued drivers and passengers and greater life from heavy vehicle chassis, suspension and coachwork components. Other work in the joint QUT/Main Roads project Heavy vehicle suspensions – testing and analysis has postulated that an imperfect transfer of air between air springs by the use of (say) some constriction device, such as a smaller pipe, to join the connection mechanism to the air springs would be advantageous in that it would damp out pneumatic excitation of resonant frequencies in such air spring systems (Davis & Bunker, 2008 b). The results and analysis in this report bear out this contention. Increasing load sharing fraction (LSF) values, implying as lessening of the constrictions between air springs are useful for reducing dynamic peak loads up to a point. After a particular value of load sharing fraction, to be determined by other research beyond the scope of this project, further increases in load sharing fractions between air springs allow axle hop and the associated ride harshness to be transmitted into the chassis of the vehicle...|$|E

Buch, Halle Institute for Economic Research - IWH. Financial {{stability}} is an {{as valuable as}} <b>fragile</b> <b>good.</b> Given recent experiences, it seems understandable {{that a lot of}} resources are spent on financial supervision and regulation. However, as financial crisis history would tell, enhancing financial stability in a sustainable and long-lasting way is an ambitious objective. This holds the more so in financially integrated markets. This thesis investigates the implications of financiallyintegrated markets for financial stability and analyzes the effectiveness of oneimplemented regulatory instrument. In the first chapter, which is derived from joint work with Manuel Buchholz, we start from the observation that with the onset of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, credit risk spreads have diverged. Nevertheless, our results reveal a high degree of co-movements in sovereign credit risk, especially for eurozone countries during thesovereign debt crisis. By investigating the causes behind this pattern of co-movements,we find strong evidence for both fundamentals and non-fundamentals based contagion. Similarities in economic fundamentals, cross-country linkages in banking and commonmarket sentiment play a significant role. In the second chapter, which is based on joint work with Claudia Buch and Björn Hilberg, we analyze the effects of the German bank levy implemented in 2011. The objective of the levy is to make banks internalize their contributions to systemic risk and generate rescue funds for future financial crises financed by the banking sector. We document that, first, the revenue raised through the bank levy has been small. Second, the bulk of the payments have been contributed by large commercial banks and head institutes of savings banks and credit unions. Third, only for those banks that are affected most by the levy, there is evidence for a decline in loans, higher lending rates, and lower deposit rates. In the third chapter, I assess the effect of the network structure in international interbank markets on banking stability. Cross-border linkages in the global banking network have increased to a large extent over recent decades. This raises the question which role these interconnections play for systemic stability and the transmission of shocks. My main finding is that countries which are linked through foreign borrowing or lending positions to more stable banking systems abroad are significantly affected by positive spillover effects. Hence, bilateral cross-border linkages between banking systems, and the network they span, affect financial stability.

40|$|Trade is an {{important}} aspect of the economic geography of any country and during the 19 th century trade in the Sudan laboured under peculiar difficulties. A harsh physical environment, presenting many difficulties, not least the absence of water, was associated with economic backwardness and political unrest. Thus in the 19 th century trade was still limited to certain basic natural products, such as gum and ivory which had been articles of trade from earliest times. Further development was curtailed by a scarcity of capital, the absence of a standard currency, heavy and arbitrary taxation associated with administrative incompetence and short-sighted monopolistic policies. Underlying many of these problems was the absence of a cheap and efficient means of transport. As a result of physical barriers along the Nile in form of cataracts, trade routes were forced to cross barren deserts and hence the only mode of transport available was the camel. Slow and temperamental, this beast possessed only a limited carrying capacity and this fact, together with the nature of the routes followed, to a great extent determined the type of articles which could be transported. All <b>fragile</b> and bulky <b>goods</b> were necessarily excluded, and for export, traders of necessity concentrated an those products with a high value per unit weight, such as perfumes, spices and cotton goods. In addition to this trade in high value materials there was internal trade consisting mainly of provisions dealing which tended to be seasonally variable and relatively localised. Throughout the 19 th century in an attempt to stimulate trade successive governments resorted to various schemes, attempting to improve communications and develop agricultural resources so as to diversify the articles available for export. These were some short-term successes but in general most of these attempts were a failure because of a singular lack of overall economic planning and the high cost and inadequacy of transport...|$|R
