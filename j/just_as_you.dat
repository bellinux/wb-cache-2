25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E
25|$|O People, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{regard this}} month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard {{the life and}} {{property}} of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one {{so that no one}} may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...|$|E

500|$|The album's sound also {{incorporates}} diverse musical {{elements from}} various genres such as funk, soul, rock, dubstep, and electro music. Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> start to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment". Big Boi has called the music [...] "basically what you been getting from Outkast. Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on." ...|$|E
500|$|Rose Prince, {{writing in}} The Independent, {{describes}} Glasse as [...] "the first domestic goddess, {{the queen of}} the dinner party and the most important cookery writer to know about." [...] She notes that Clarissa Dickson-Wright [...] "makes a good case" [...] for giving Glasse this much credit, that Glasse had found a gap in the market, and had the distinctions of simplicity, an [...] "appetising repertoire", and a lightness of touch. Prince quotes the food writer Bee Wilson: [...] "She's authoritative but she is also intimate, treating you as an equal", and concludes [...] "A perfect book, then; one that deserved the acclaim it received." [...] Jane Shilling, writing in Mail Online, agrees, noting that [...] "Glasse writes in the same sort of chatty, intimate style that makes Delia and Nigella's books so comforting for the nervous cook: Glasse concludes one chapter 'You must do <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an [...] "A" [...] rating and praised Benicio del Toro's performance, which critic Owen Gleiberman called, [...] "haunting in his understatement, [...] becomes the film's quietly {{awakening}} moral center". Desson Howe, {{in his review}} for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts exposé of the world's most lucrative trade". In his review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote, [...] "The hand-held camerawork [...] Soderbergh himself did the holdingprovides a documentary feel that rivets attention". However, Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "there is a possibly predictable downside to this multiplicity of story lines: they keep interrupting one another. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> get interested in one, Stephen Gaghan's script, inspired by a British mini-series, jerks you away to another". In an interview, director Ingmar Bergman lauded the film as [...] "amazing".|$|E

500|$|In 2002, in {{collaboration}} with dynamicist Harold Levison, Stern wrote, [...] "we define an überplanet as a planetary body in orbit around a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] and then a few paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E
500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> think you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E

In addition, Hambali confessed that al-Qaeda had sent him $US30,000 to fund the bombings of the two nightclubs.|$|E
6000|$|Adam, too angry to speak, {{walked into}} the workshop.

2500|$|In March 1847, Omoo, {{a sequel}} to Typee, was {{published}} by Murray in London, and in May by Harper in New York. Omoo is [...] "a slighter but more professional book," [...] according to Milder. Typee and Omoo gave Melville overnight renown {{as a writer and}} adventurer, and he often entertained by telling stories to his admirers. As the writer and editor Nathaniel Parker Willis wrote, [...] "With his cigar and his Spanish eyes, he talks Typee and Omoo, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> find the flow of his delightful mind on paper."

2500|$|... "It {{should be}} made clear that if {{fundamentalism}} or terrorism exist, they are {{a reaction to the}} colonial militarism of the West in the Islamic world, from the 18th century until today. European armies occupied all of North and South America and Africa, in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and divided them among themselves. Then they came to the Islamic world in North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is only natural that the Muslims act in accordance with their religious duty, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would defend your homes if they were occupied. Why do we call resistance 'terrorism'?

2500|$|In his {{scientific}} study of Sadoveanu's work, Eugen Lovinescu himself turns to pure literature, portraying Sadoveanu as a child blessed by the Moirai or ursitoare with ironic gifts, such as an obstinacy for nature writing {{in the absence of}} actual observation ("You shall write; you shall write and could never stop yourself writing [...] The readers will grow tired, but you will remain tireless; you shall not known rest, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> shall not know nature [...] "). George Călinescu was one to object to this portrayal, noting that it was merely a [...] "literary device which hardly covers the emptiness of [...] idea." [...] Also during the interwar, philosopher Mihai Ralea made Mihail Sadoveanu the subject of a sociological study investigating his literary contributions in the context of social evolutions.|$|E
