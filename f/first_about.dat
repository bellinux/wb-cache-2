5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the <b>first</b> <b>about</b> 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Selena's {{life and}} career were covered {{by a number of}} {{television}} programs, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, E! True Hollywood Story, VH1's Behind The Music, American Justice, Snapped, and Famous Crime Scene. Other networks including MTV, Investigation Discovery, The Biography Channel, and A Network have aired special programs about Selena, while Spanish-language networks regularly show documentaries to commemorate the anniversary of her death. These Spanish-language documentaries are among the most-watched programs in the history of American television, and often score record ratings for networks. A documentary titled Selena, A Star is Dimmed—one of the <b>first</b> <b>about</b> her—was broadcast on Univison's Primer Impacto on April 22, 1995; it was watched by 2.09 million people and became the second-most-viewed Spanish-language show in the history of American television at the time. Networks competed with each other to interview Saldívar about the shooting. When news that Arrarás was able to interview her broke, Univision was inundated with requests to use the interview from major networks as far away as Germany. The interview on Primer Impacto was watched by 4.5 million viewers; it was the most-watched program that night according to the Nielsen ratings, and became one of the most-watched Spanish-language programs in American television history.|$|E

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn <b>first</b> <b>about</b> the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E

The doctor will also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{which is the most}} sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.|$|E

25|$|Mamoru {{struggles with}} his {{identity}} and function throughout the series, worrying <b>first</b> <b>about</b> his true nature, then later whether {{he gets in}} the way of the Sailor Soldiers. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.|$|E

[...] Kōki Uchiyama, who played Gin, read the manga for the audition, and confessed that he was concerned at <b>first</b> <b>about</b> how to portray his character, though his work made him feel good. [...] The film was initially pre-scored, where the voice acting was recorded prior {{to the creation of}} the animation, but later re-recorded for the final version.

The <b>first</b> <b>about</b> 6.9million years ago produced the northern and central hills while the younger and highly eroded Mount Gower and Mount Lidgbird were produced about 6.3million years ago by successive basalt (an extrusive igneous rock) lava flows that once filled a large volcanic caldera (crater) and can now be seen as horizontal basalt strata on mountain cliffs (at Malabar and Mount Gower) occasionally interspersed with dikes (vertical lava intrusions). Geological pyroclastic remnants of volcanic eruption {{can be seen on}} the [...] Roach Island (where the oldest rocks occur) and Boat Harbour as tuff (ash), breccia (with angular blocks), and agglomerate (rounded 'bombs').

500|$|On 11 September 2014, {{as part of}} the {{coverage}} of the Scottish independence referendum, Nick Robinson had a dispute with Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond.

In the exchange Robinson asked Salmond two questions: the <b>first</b> <b>about</b> the economic impact of RBS moving its headquarters; the second, more general, about why to trust a politician when CEO's of certain companies advised against independence. In his response, Salmond made points about how the BBC had obtained market-sensitive information. A report was shown on all BBC evening news programmes later that day as part of which Robinson stated Salmond had not answered his question but had instead chosen to lay accusations against the BBC. The BBC received complaints from viewers over the implication that Salmond had not answered a question put to him; there was a protest in Glasgow, in which between 1000 and 2000 protestors called for Robinson to be sacked. The BBC responded: [...] "The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines.|$|E
