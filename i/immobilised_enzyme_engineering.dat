40|$|An enzymatic sensor {{employing}} lysine oxidase (LOx) {{with the}} <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde using an immunodyne ABC nylon membrane, {{in combination with}} an oxygen electrode, has been optimised to determine the lysine content in dry-cured ham and dry-fermented sausage at different cured times. The amperometric signal obtained due to the oxygen depletion (consumed oxygen) during the lysine oxidation was recorded at 5 s in the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> sensor, and the reaction rates (slope) {{were related to the}} lysine content. A linear relationship between the consumed oxygen as a function of time (mg O 2 /l/s) and the lysine concentration in the range 10 – 250 μM (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 9946) for the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system was found. The <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> sensor showed a high specificity and sensibility. Nevertheless, the stability of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> at the assay temperature was very poor, and thus, a new membrane was required for each analysis. The analysis of lysine with the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> system in cured meat samples revealed very good agreement with the determination performed through standard HPLC methodology, which validated the use of this sensor as an alternative technique to evaluate cured meat quality.

40|$|Namen diplomske naloge je bila uspešna imobilizacija komercialnega encimskega preparata DENILITE II S na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce in primerjava aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima s prostim encimom. Sintetizirali smo hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce po metodi kovalentne vezave in nanje imobilizirali encim. Za aktivacijo funkcionalnih skupin nosilca smo uporabili mrežna povezovalca glutaraldehid (GA) in pentaetilen heksamin (PEHA). Z različnimi koncentracijami mrežnega povezovalca smo aktivirali funkcionalne skupine nosilca ter iskali optimalno učinkovitost imobilizacije in preostalo aktivnost imobiliziranega encima. Zanimala nas je tudi stabilnost encima, kako vplivata čas in temperatura izpostavitve na ohranitev preostale aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima. Imobilizirani encim ima prednost pred prostim encimom, saj se lahko večkrat uporabi, zato smo preverili, kako vpliva večkratna uporaba na ohranitev preostale aktivnosti imobiliziranega encima. Najvišjo preostalo aktivnost imobiliziranega encima na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce smo dosegli pri dodatku mrežnega povezovalca GA (3 %) in koncentraciji encima 0, 05 g/mL. Encim, imobiliziran na hitozanske maghemitne nanodelce pri optimalnih pogojih, smo izpostavili za določen čas različnim temperaturam in opazili, da se preostala aktivnost ne ohrani. Proučevali smo tudi vpliv večkratne uporabe imobiliziranega encima na preostalo aktivnost. Imobiliziran encim smo večkrat ponovno uporabili in ugotovili, da aktivnost encima z naraščanjem števila ciklov upada. The goal of {{the thesis}} was to {{successfully}} immobilise DENILITE II S, a commercial enzyme preparation, onto maghemite nanoparticles coated by chitosan and to compare {{the activity of the}} <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> to that of the free enzyme. The chitosan coated nanoparticles had been synthesised with the covalent bond method and the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> was added. To activate the functional groups of the carrier, glutaraldehyde (GA) and pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA) were used as crosslinking agents. By applying different concentrations of the crosslinking agents, functional groups of the carrier were activated and looked to determine the optimal efficiency of the enzyme immobilisation and the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme.</b> We were also interested in the stability of the enzyme and how the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> was affected by exposed time and temperature. The <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> has an advantage over the free enzyme, because it can be used more timestherefore we examined how multiple usage affects the remaining activity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The highest values in the remaining activity of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>immobilised</b> onto maghemite nanoparticles coated by chitosan was achieved, when the crosslinking agent GA (3 %) was applied and with enzyme concentration at 0. 05 g/mL.

40|$|Enzyme {{immobilisation}} is {{the conversion}} of a soluble enzyme molecule into a solid particle form. This allows {{the recovery of the}} enzyme catalyst for its re-use and avoids protein contamination of the product streams. A better understanding of <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> is necessary for their rational development. A more rational design can help enormously in the applicability of these systems in different areas, from biosensors to chemical industry. <b>Immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> are challenging systems to study and very little information is given by conventional biochemical analysis such as catalytic activity and amount of protein. Here, solid-state NMR has been applied as the main technique to study these systems and evaluate them more precisely. Various approaches are presented for a better understanding of <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which is the aim of this thesis. Firstly, the requirements of a model system of study will be discussed. The selected systems will be comprehensibly characterised by a variety of techniques but mainly by solid-state NMR. The chosen system will essentially be the <b>enzyme</b> α-chymotrypsin covalently <b>immobilised</b> on two functionalised inorganic supports – epoxide silica and epoxide alumina – and an organic support – Eupergit®. The study of interactions of <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes</b> with other species is vital for understanding the macromolecular function and for predicting and engineering protein behaviour. The study of water, ions and inhibitors interacting with various <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> systems is covered here. The interactions of water and sodium ions were studied by 17 O and 23 Na multiple-quantum techniques, respectively. Various pore sizes of the supports were studied for the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> in the presence of labelled water and sodium cations. Finally, interactions between two fluorinated inhibitors and the active site of the enzyme will be explored using 19 F NMR, offering a unique approach to evaluate catalytic behaviour. These interactions will be explored by solution-state NMR firstly, then by solid-state NMR. NMR has the potential to give information {{about the state of the}} protein in the solid support, but the precise molecular interpretation is a difficult task...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermodialysis on the enzymatic kinetic {{synthesis}} of the antibiotic cephalexin was investigated. As reference points, two existing models for an <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> (Assemblase?) and for the free enzyme were used. For Assemblase?, {{it is known that}} diffusion limitation occurs and that therefore considerably more of the undesired side-product phenylglycine is formed. The <b>enzyme</b> was <b>immobilised</b> on a membrane, and under isothermal conditions (293 K) the course of the reaction resembled that of the Assemblase? enzyme.

Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzymes.</b>|$|R

To foster {{the use of this}} versatile method we devised an automated injector for the production of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) /polyethylene glycol (PEG) beads. The device consists of a thermostated reservoir connected to a programmable injector nozzle and an agitated receiving bath for the droplets. This lab scale production unit yields up to 1500 beads with <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> per minute with a narrow size distribution and good roundness...|$|R

The reactivity of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> was {{studied in the}} oxidative functionalisation of softwood milled wood and residual kraft lignins and found higher than the free enzyme. In order to investigate the chemical modifications in the lignin structure, quantitative 31 P NMR was used. The immobilised HRP showed a higher reactivity {{with respect to the}} native enzyme yielding extensive depolymerisation of lignin. L'articolo è disponibile sul sito dell'editore: [URL]...|$|R

This mutant <b>enzyme</b> was then <b>immobilised</b> onto poly(aniline) (PANi) -poly(anion) composite films, PANi-poly(vinylsulfonate) (PVS) or PANi-poly(acrylate) (PAA). The NADH produced by the <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{in the presence of}} ?-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and lactate is oxidised at the poly(aniline) -coated electrode at 0. 05 to 0. 1 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at 35 °C...|$|R

Process options to minimise the environmental impact and improve the efficiency of biodiesel production have been investigated. The process options considered {{include the use of}} heterogeneous catalysts and used cooking oil (UCO). An esterification pre-treatment reaction was investigated using an ion-exchange resin (Purolite D 5082) and an <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> (Novozyme 435). Another <b>immobilised</b> <b>enzyme</b> (Amano Lipase PS-IM) was investigated for transesterification. The fresh and used catalysts have been characterised. The catalytic activity of Purolite D 5082, Novozyme 435 and Amano Lipase PS-IM have been investigated using a jacketed batch reactor with a reflux condenser. Purolite D 5082 has been developed for the esterification pre-treatment process and is not commercially available. Novozyme 435 {{has been shown to be}} an effective esterification catalyst for materials with high concentrations of free fatty acid but it has not been investigated for the esterification pre-treatment reaction. It was found that a high conversion was possible with both catalysts. The optimum reaction conditions identified for Purolite D 5081 were a temperature of 60 C, a methanol to free fatty acid (FFA) mole ratio of 62 : 1, a catalyst loading of 5 wt...|$|R
