5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} Relief faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Much <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> law as unconstitutional, ensuring that <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E

5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> fund, enabling a 20% <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{show that}} debt buybacks could convey {{valuable}} information about indebted countries' {{willingness to invest}} and increase debt repayment when creditors are less informed than debtors. In an informational equilibrium, unwilling countries do not repurchase {{a part of their}} debt, but willing countries do; and creditors increase debt repayments by offering reliefs only to those countries that repurchase. Data show that creditors systematically grant <b>debt</b> <b>reliefs</b> only to countries with buyback programs; and a country's secondary market debt price is higher when it has a buyback program than if it does not.

5|$|In 1807, Desha {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. A Democratic-Republican, he was considered a war hawk, supporting the War of 1812. In 1813, he volunteered to serve in the war and commanded a division at the Battle of the Thames. Returning to Congress after the war, he was {{the only member of the}} Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the unpopular Compensation Act of 1816. Nearly every other member of the delegation was defeated for reelection after the vote, but Desha's opposition to the act helped him retain his seat. He did not seek reelection in 1818, and made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1820, losing to John Adair. By 1824, the Panic of 1819 had ruined Kentucky's economy, and Desha made a second campaign for the governorship almost exclusively on promises of relief for the state's large debtor class. He was elected by a large majority, and <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> partisans captured both houses of the General Assembly. After the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> laws favored by Desha and the majority of the legislature, the legislators abolished the court and created a replacement court, to which Desha appointed several <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> partisans. The existing court refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the move, and during a period known as the Old Court – New Court controversy, two courts of last resort existed in the state.|$|E

5|$|Sharp {{took office}} at a {{critical}} time Kentucky's history. Still reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the <b>Debt</b> <b>Relief</b> Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.|$|E

5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking relief from obligations they could not meet. A <b>Debt</b> <b>Relief</b> Party sprang up in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.|$|E
5|$|Both {{cases were}} {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the highest court in Kentuckyin 1823. In the case of Blair, the <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> {{position}} was argued by George M. Bibb, while the anti-relief position was represented by Robert Wickliffe. In Lapsley, Wickliffe joined George Robertson and Ben Hardin to represent the anti-relief position, while the relief position was argued by John Rowan and William T. Barry. Chief Justice John Boyle wrote the majority opinion in Blair on October 8, 1823, and Associate Justice William Owsley issued the court's opinion in Lapsley three days later. In both cases, the anti-relief position was upheld.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> agenda.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|Owsley studied law under John Boyle. After briefly {{serving in}} the state legislature, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Charles Scott to serve alongside Boyle on the Kentucky Court of Appeals.

In 1824, the state legislature, unhappy with the court's rulings against <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> legislation, attempted to abolish the court {{and replace it with a}} new court. For a time, both courts operated simultaneously, and both claimed to be the court of last resort in the state. Supporters of the old court won control of the legislature and abolished the new court in 1826. Owsley resigned from the Court of Appeals two years later.|$|E
5|$|Sharp {{began his}} {{political}} career representing Warren County, in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

He was re-elected to a second term, though his support of a controversial bill regarding legislator salaries cost him his seat in 1816. Allied with Kentucky's <b>Debt</b> <b>Relief</b> Party, he returned to the Kentucky House in 1817; in 1821, he accepted Governor John Adair's appointment to the post of Attorney General of Kentucky. Adair's successor, Joseph Desha, re-appointed him to this position. In 1825, Sharp resigned as attorney general to return to the Kentucky House.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of the creditors. Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down <b>debt</b> <b>relief</b> legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E

This decomposition reveals how banks transmit monetary policy within their organizations.

ECB purchase programs reduced refinancing costs significantly, even in an economy not specifically targeted for sovereign <b>debt</b> stress <b>relief,</b> but not loan rates themselves.
