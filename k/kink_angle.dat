40|$|The paper {{describes}} a suitability of Virtual Crack Extension (VCE) method for numerical simulation of crack propagation under mixed mode loading. The suitability of VCE method was determined using The Compact-Tension-Shear (CTS), which {{is subjected to}} fracture Mode I, Mode II or mixed mode (Mode I + Mode II) loading. In mixed mode the crack kinks when fracture crack growth occurs. <b>Kink</b> <b>angle</b> is determined with VCE method, which is an energy method, maximum tangential stress (MTS) criterion, strain energy density (SED) criterion and experimental results. Determination of crack propagation angle using MTS and SED criterion is based {{in regard to the}} stress intensity factors KI and KII. Stress intensity factors are determined using the maximum energy release rate theory using complex J integral, crack opening displacement method and method of stresses extrapolation. Bigger is the rate between KII and KI, crack path, determined with VCE method, propagates more slowly to the <b>kink</b> <b>angle,</b> determined with experiment. The computational results show that the VCE method is suitable for crack propagation, when KI around the crack tip is dominant. In case where KII is dominant, crack does not kink immediately as in other two criteria.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A kinked crack {{propagating}} in {{a periodic}} self-balanced multiaxial microstress field having self-similar characteristics is considered. The <b>kinking</b> <b>angle</b> of the crack {{is shown to}} depend on the properties of the microstress field. Using the Richardson’s expression for self-similar fractals, the fractal dimension of the crack is expressed {{as a function of the}} <b>kinking</b> <b>angle.</b> Crack size effect on the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime can be interpreted by the present model. Further, the Kitagawa diagram can be interpreted by showing that the threshold condition of fatigue crack growth is affected by the crack <b>kinking</b> <b>angle</b> which, in turn, is a function of the ratio between crack length and microstructure characteristic length...|$|R

40|$|Restricted Access. We report {{measurements}} of the temperature variations of the optical birefringence in the nematic (N) and partial bilayer SmA (SmAd) phases in 4 -n-octyloxy 4 ′ -cyanobiphenyl made of rod-like (R) molecules and five mixtures of this compound with 1, 3 -phenylene bis[4 -(3 -methylbenzoyloxy) ] 4 ′ -n- dodecylbiphenyl 4 ′ -carboxylate, made of bent-core (BC) molecules. The birefringence decreases with the concentration x of the BC molecules but the macroscopic order parameter initially decreases upto 11 mol% of BC molecules and subsequently increases with x. This is attributed to the possible formation of polar clusters of BC molecules. Orientation of BC molecules changes between the N and SmAd phases and the birefringence data in the two phases imply that the <b>kink</b> <b>angle</b> of the BC molecules is ∼ 90 ° rather than ∼ 110 ° as obtained from calculations which minimize {{the energy of the}} molecule.

40|$|A {{simplified}} approach {{for evaluating the}} stress intensity factors of an inclined edge kinked crack in a semi-plane is presented.

Since the weight function coefficients must be expressed in tabular form parametric in the a/a 0 ratio, the computational efficiency of the method was improved by investigating the possibility of substituting the original kinked crack with an equivalent crack connecting the two extremities of the original crack and made up by a main linear segment ending with an infinitesimal kinked part aligned with the terminal kinked segment of the original crack.

40|$|Secondary {{fractures}} at {{the tips}} of strike-slip faults are common in the ice shell of Europa. Large magnitude perturbed stress fields must there-fore {{be considered to be}} a viable driving mechanism for the development of part of the fracture sequence. Fault motions produce extensional and compressional quadrants around the fault tips. Theoretically, these quadrants can be associated with tensile and compressive deformational fea-tures (i. e. cracks and anti-cracks), respectively. Accordingly, we describe examples of both types of deformation at fault tips on Europa in the form of extensional tailcracks and compressional anti-cracks. The characteristics of these features with respect to the plane of the fault create a fingerprint for the mechanics of fault slip accumulation when compared with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) models of perturbed stress fields around fault tips. Tailcrack <b>kink</b> <b>angles</b> and curving geometry can be used to determine whether opening accompanies sliding motion. <b>Kink</b> <b>angles</b> in the 50 e 70 range are common along strike-slip faults that resemble ridges, and indicate that little to no opening accom-panied sliding. In contrast, tailcrack <b>kink</b> <b>angles</b> are closer to 30 for strike-slip faults that resemble bands, with tailcrack curvatures opposite to ridge-like fault examples, indicating that these faults undergo significant dilation and infill during fault slip episodes. Anti-cracks, which may result from compression and volume reduction of porous near-surface ice, have geometries that further constrain fault motion history, corrob-orating the results of tailcrack analysis. The angular separation between anti-cracks and tailcracks are similar to LEFM predictions, indicating the absence of cohesive end-zones near {{the tips of}} Europan faults, hence suggesting homogeneous frictional properties along the fault length.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a survey on Mixed-Mode {{fracture}} and fatigue problems is carried out. At first the overlapping of fractures Modes I and II will be considered. For such loading situations both {{the occurrence of}} unstable crack growth and the <b>kinking</b> <b>angle</b> of the crack can be predicted by different fracture criterions. For {{the case of an}} unstable propagation of a crack under superimposed Mode I and Mode II loading those criteria have proven their reliability for homogenous materials, which has already been shown by various experimental research. If an existing crack is subjected to a Mixed-Mode loading, the direction of crack propagation changes. The <b>kinking</b> <b>angle</b> for such a crack can be predicted very well by the existing criteria. It is notable, that a delayed crack growth can be observed when a kinking of a fatigue crack takes place.
