Tests and analyses indicate that this was due to gas leakage through the displaced fill tube assembly added. [...] f. The special detanking procedures at KSC subjected the tank to an extended period of heater operation and pressure cycling. These procedures had not been used before added, and the tank had not been qualified by test for the conditions experienced. However, the procedures did not violate the specifications which governed the operation of the heaters at KSC. [...] g. In reviewing these procedures before the flight, officials of NASA, ER, and Beech did not recognize the possibility of damage due to overheating. Many of these officials were not aware of the extended heater operation. In any event, adequate thermostatic switches might have been expected to protect the tank added. [...] h. [...] "A number of factors contributed to the presence of inadequate thermostatic switches in the <b>heater</b> <b>assembly.</b> The original 1962 specifications from NR to Beech Aircraft Corporation for the tank and <b>heater</b> <b>assembly</b> specified the use of 28 V added dc power, which is used in the spacecraft. In 1965, NR issued a revised specification which stated that the heaters should use a 65 V added dc power supply for tank pressurization; this was the power supply used at KSC to reduce pressurization time. Beech ordered switches for the Block II tanks but did not change the switch specifications to be compatible with 65 V dc." ...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear fuel {{comes in}} many forms; oxide fuel {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used in current reactor systems while metal fuel is a promising fuel type for future reactors due to neutronic performance and increased thermal conductivity. As a key heat transfer parameter, thermal conductivity describes the heat transport properties of a material based upon the density, specific heat, and thermal diffusivity. A material?s ability to transport thermal energy through its structure is a measurable property known as thermal diffusivity; the units for thermal diffusivity are given in area per unit time (e. g., m 2 /s). Current measurement methods for thermal diffusivity include LASER (or light) Flash Analysis and the hot-wire method. This study examines an approach that combines these previous two methods to characterize the diffusivity of a packed bed of microspheres of depleted uranium (DU) metal, which have a nominal diameter of 250 micrometers. The new apparatus is designated as the Crucible <b>Heater</b> Test <b>Assembly</b> (CHTA), and it induces a radial transient across a packed sample of microspheres then monitors the temperature profile using an array of thermocouples located at different distances from the source of the thermal transient. From the thermocouple data and an accurate time log, the thermal diffusivity of the sample may be calculated. Results indicate that DU microspheres have very low thermal conductivity, relative to solid uranium metal, and rapidly form an oxidation layer. At 500 ?C, the thermal conductivity of the DU microspheres was 0. 431 ? 13 % W/m-K compared to approximately 32 W/m-K for solid uranium metal.

40|$|In {{light of}} the TMI- 2 accident, in which the reactor vessel lower head survived the attack by molten core material, the in-vessel {{retention}} strategy was suggested to benefit from cooling the debris through {{a gap between the}} lower head and the core material. The GAMMA 1 D (Gap Apparatus Mitigating Melt Attack One Dimensional) tests were conducted to investigate the critical heat flux (CHF) in narrow gaps with varying surface orientations. The CHF in an inclined gap, especially in case of the downward-facing narrow gap, is dictated by bubble behavior because the departing bubbles are squeezed. The orientation angle affects the bubble layer and escape of the bubbles from the narrow gap. The test parameters include gap sizes of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm and the open periphery, and the orientation angles range from the fully downward-facing (180 o) to the vertical (90 o) position. The 15 × 35 mm copper test section was electrically heated by the thin film resistor on the back. The <b>heater</b> <b>assembly</b> was installed to the tip of the rotating arm in the heated water pool at the atmospheric pressure. The bubble behavior was photographed utilizing a high-speed camera through the Pyrex glass spacer. It was observed that the CHF decreased as the surface inclination angle increased and as the gap size decreased in most of the cases. However, the opposing results were obtained at certain surface orientations and gap sizes. Transition angles, at which the CHF changed in a rapid slope, were also detected, which is consistent with the existing literature. A semi-empirical CHF correlation was developed for the inclined narrow rectangular channels through dimensional analysis. The correlation provides with best-estimate CHF values for realistically assessing the thermal margin to failure of the lower head during a severe accident involving relocation of the core material...|$|E
40|$|With the {{tremendous}} growth {{in demand for}} energy resources, {{there is a growing}} need to adopt alternative energy technologies, including ones that tap renewable energy sources as well as use non-renewable sources more efficiently. Thermoelectric energy generation is one such emerging technology. Thermoelectrics can convert waste heat from various sources [...] significantly, many industrial processes as well as vehicles [...] directly into electrical power. Thermoelectric devices can generate power when a temperature difference is applied across them. Major barriers to mainstream adoption of thermoelectric devices are their low efficiency and high cost. These are mostly limited by the properties of the constituent materials of the device(s) and the operating temperatures. In the past decade there have been significant advancements in thermoelectric materials that can be used at higher temperatures. The properties of thermoelectric materials are temperature dependent, and may also vary from bulk material to device level. Right now, devices with higher working temperatures are not available. According to feedback from laboratories working on high-temperature modules, the next stage in the development of thermoelectric devices would go up to 650 °C. The main focus of this project is to design and develop a test stand to evaluate the properties of all such high-temperature devices. One of the critical challenges in testing modules, especially at high temperatures, is being able to accurately control and measure heat rates transferred across a module. Many of the current characterization techniques are limited to solely measuring the electrical response and ignoring the heat transfer. A new testing technique, 2 ̆ 2 rapid steady state, 2 ̆ 2 was developed, which is able to accurately measure the three key characteristic properties [...] the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistance, and thermal conductance [...] of a thermoelectric module over temperature ranges from 50 to 650 °C. To ensure isothermal surfaces and minimize heat rate errors, a primary heater is encased in a guard heater. Rapid pulsed electronic loading allows for rapid voltage-current scans while avoiding thermal drift. The thermal conductivity of a reference material is used to validate the performance of the guard <b>heater</b> <b>assembly</b> and heat-monitoring setup...|$|E

A steady-state, Parallel-Plate Thermal Conductivity (PPTC) Apparatus has been developed {{in order to determine the}} thermal conductivity of these POLY-nanofluids. The apparatus consists of a <b>heater</b> <b>assembly</b> above the test fluid specimen and a chiller assembly below the test fluid specimen. This creates a temperature difference which is measured by calibrated thermocouples imbedded in the parallel plates. This temperature difference is then used, along with the heating power, to calculate the thermal conductivity of the test fluid specimen. This scheme, along with a sufficiently thin test fluid specimen thickness, retards convection in the test fluid specimen and creates a heat transfer mechanism consisting virtually of heat conduction mode. The apparatus is also adequately insulated, restricting nearly all heat conduction to the axial direction. The PPTC Apparatus has been fully calibrated in order to insure accurate and precise measurement results. All thermocouples used have been calibrated against a precise RTD, reducing thermocouple uncertainty to 0. 12 °C. A correction factor has been developed in order to minimize errors occurring in fluid thermal conductivity measurements due to heat loss through the top of the apparatus. A conservative uncertainty analysis has been performed for the PPTC Apparatus using the method of propagation of error, resulting in an uncertainty of approximately 8 %. A steady-state condition for the PPTC Apparatus has been developed through calibration of the PPTC Apparatus using distilled water. This PPTC Apparatus has been used to explore the effects of polymer additives on the thermal conductivity of POLY-nanofluids. Comparative measurements have been made using the previously developed HWTC Apparatus (Simham, 2008) in order to explore the possible influence of different measurement techniques on the thermal conductivity results regarding complex POLY-nanofluids. Nanofluids containing silica and alumina nanoparticles have been prepared to satisfy the zeta potential vs. pH relationship in order to achieve suspension stability (Singh et al., 2005). Polymer additives including the surfactant polyvinylpyrrolidone, or PVP (for stability enhancement), and polyacrylamide (for turbulent drag reduction) have been added to the nanofluids. The resulting hybrid fluids, dubbed POLY-nanofluids (Kostic, 2006), exhibit thermal conductivity enhancements when compared with the base fluid (distilled water). On average, the thermal conductivity enhancements measured by the HWTC Apparatus are about 3 times greater than the thermal conductivity enhancements measured by the PPTC Apparatus. This difference suggests that the measurement technique has a substantial impact on the observed thermal conductivity enhancement of both standard nanofluids and POLY-nanofluids over the base fluid. In addition, the POLY-nanofluid suspension might degrade during the lengthy steady-state thermal conductivity measurements using the PPTC apparatus. The results obtained using the PPTC Apparatus are similar to those predicted by simple mixture theory. The average thermal conductivity enhancement over the base fluid exhibited by the silica POLY-nanofluids is 1. 3 % when measured using the PPTC Apparatus and 4. 4 % when measured using the HWTC Apparatus. The average thermal conductivity enhancement over the base fluid exhibited by the alumina POLY-nanofluids is 3. 8 % when measured using the PPTC Apparatus and 11. 4 % when measured using the HWTC Apparatus. The effects of the polymer additives PVP and polyacrylamide on the silica nanofluids can be classified as statistically insignificant. The thermal conductivity enhancement over the standard alumina nanofluid exhibited by the alumina POLY-nanofluids suggest that a small concentration of PVP can be beneficial to alumina nanofluid thermal conductivity, while a small concentration of polyacrylamide can have a negative effect on thermal conductivity. The viscosity of the POLY-nanofluids was also explored. The POLY-nanofluids containing PVP exhibited a slight increase in viscosity when compared to the base fluid, while the POLY-nanofluids containing polyacrylamide exhibited a large increase in viscosity when compared to the base fluid.
