On 30 May 2016, the International Law Commission (ILC) adopted a set of 16 <b>draft</b> <b>Conclusions</b> providing a methodology on how to identify customary international law. Although largely based on the two elements approach set forth in Article 38 (1) (b) of the ICJ Statute, the ILC study pushes the boundaries of the formal sources of international law beyond the realm of state practice by recognizing that the practice of international organizations (IOs) as such may be constitutive of custom. This article critically examines the ILC <b>draft</b> <b>Conclusions</b> concerning the role of IOs in the process of custom creation. It examines the concept of resolution adopted by the ILC and assesses the coherence of the interpretive methodology devised by the ILC using the UN General Assembly resolutions as a case study.

40|$|The International Law Commission {{held its}} sixty-eighth session in Geneva from May 2 to June 10, and from July 4 to August 12, 2016, under the {{chairmanship}} of Pedro Comissário Afonso (Mozambique). Notably, the Commission completed on second reading {{a full set of}} eighteen draft articles with commentary on the protection of persons in the event of disasters and recommended to the United Nations General Assembly that it elaborate a convention based on the draft articles. Additionally, the Commission adopted on first reading a complete set of <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions,</b> with commentary, for two topics: identification of customary international law; and subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties. As such, both topics might be completed by the Commission on second reading in 2018. Progress was also made in developing draft articles on crimes against humanity; draft guidelines on protection of the atmosphere; <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions</b> on jus cogens; and draft principles on protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts. The Commission commenced a debate on a proposed draft article on “limitations and exceptions” to the immunity of state officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction, but, due to insufficient time, the debate will continue in 2017. Furthermore, an additional proposed guideline on the provisional application of treaties was sent to the drafting committee.

40|$|This WP {{is based}} on Sir Michael Wood's Distinguished Lecture at the 2016 Human Rights Summer Course held on 27 June 2016 at the European University Institute in Florence. The lecture {{addresses}} the International Law Commission (ILC) ’s work on ‘Identification of customary international law’, with particular reference to human rights law. In 2016, the ILC adopted 16 <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions,</b> with commentaries. Draft conclusion 2 confirms the two-element approach (a general practice; acceptance as law). It is sometimes asserted rules of human rights are ‘special’, and that different criteria for the formation and identification of customary international law in this field are thus in order. In particular, it is sometimes suggested that {{in the field of}} international human rights law, one element may suffice in constituting customary international law, namely opinio juris. But this cannot be the case as long as we are dealing with what properly may be called “customary international law”. There may, however, be a difference in the application of the two-element approach. Among other issues discussed are the role of international organizations; the relationship between customary international law and treaties: the effect of resolutions of international organizations; judicial decisions and teachings; the persistent objector; and particular customary international law. After the lecture (on 27 June 2016), the International Law Commission adopted the 16 <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions</b> on ‘Identification of customary international law’, together with their accompanying commentaries, on 5 and 8 August 2016. They may be found in the ILC’s Report on the Work of its Sixty-Eighth Session (2016), UN Doc.

The work included both comparative conceptual analysis and an empirical investigation of some one hundred sets of financial statements — half from each country. From a conceptual perspective it is clear that thinking and tradition in the two countries are significantly different. The French distinctions between dettes provisionnees, provisions pour risques et charges and engagements can in no way be simplistically equated with distinc-tions in the UK between provisions, contingent liabilities and commitments. Detailed analysis of one system in terms of thinking and terminology of the other is fraught with difficulty. This has obvious implications for attempts at harmoniz-ation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} consensus case definitions {{for several}} common work related upper limb pain syndromes {{for use in}} surveillance or studies of the aetiology of these conditions. METHODS: A group of healthcare professionals from the disciplines interested in the prevention and management of upper limb disorders were recruited for a Delphi exercise. A questionnaire was used to establish case definitions from the participants, followed by a consensus conference involving the core group of 29 people. The <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions</b> were recirculated for review. RESULTS: Consensus case definitions were agreed for carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis of the wrist, de Quervain's disease of the wrist, epicondylitis, shoulder capsulitis (frozen shoulder), and shoulder tendonitis. The consensus group also identified a condition defined as "non-specific diffuse forearm pain" although this is essentially a diagnosis made by exclusion. The group {{did not have enough}} experience of the thoracic outlet syndrome to make recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: There was enough consensus between several health professionals from different disciplines to establish case definitions suitable for use in the studies of several work related upper limb pain syndromes. The use of these criteria should allow comparability between studies and centres and facilitate research in this field. The criteria may also be useful in surveillance programmes and as aids to case management...|$|E
40|$|We {{thank the}} members of the CEN TC WG 1 and WG 3, the EC-JRC and all experts {{involved}} for their valuable inputsThe European standards developed by CEN TC 350 for assessing the sustainability of construction works, i. e. EN 15804 (construction products) and EN 15978 (buildings), consider seven impact categories within the life cycle assessment approach. When looking at commonly used Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods (e. g. IMPACT 2002 + and ReCiPe) and the recently developed Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) of the European Commission, more impact categories are included. Scientific studies indicate the necessity to consider these additional impact categories. The question arises if declaring solely the seven CEN TC 350 impact categories is sufficient or if additional impact categories should be taken up. In the context of this potential need for a broader environmental perspective, a new work item proposal within CEN TC 350 has been approved for drafting a CEN Technical Report (TR) containing an overview and evaluation of additional impact categories. The goal of the TR is to collect information on six impact categories: human toxicity, ecotoxicity, particulate matter, ionising radiation, land use/biodiversity and water scarcity. The TR can be used as input for further discussions on the need for updating the standards. The draft TR was finalised in January 2016 on the basis of literature study and feedback from experts, amongst others the EC-Joint Research Centre. The process of the development of the TR and the framework for the evaluation of the seven additional impact categories (and potentially others in future) are described. Finally, the main <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions</b> on the impact categories are summarised. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group for Europol (JPSG) {{will meet}} {{for the first}} time in Brussels in the autumn of 2017. Its {{creation}} was agreed by the EU Speakers Conference (the Presidents of the EU’s national parliaments and the European Parliament) in April 2017. With this decision, the idea of a body to ensure parliamentary scrutiny of the European Police Office (Europol) finally manifests itself in the JPSG. In the emerging Security Union that the EU seeks to create, also in reaction to recent terror attacks, the responsible actors at the EU level must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. According to Article 51 of the new Europol Regulation No. 2016 / 794, the JPSG will play an essential role to “politically monitor Europol’s activities in fulfilling its mission, including as regards the impact of those activities on the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. ” In its first part, the Policy Paper examines the political difficulties to move forward with respect to intentions and provisions for enhancing the parliamentary scrutiny over Europol. The in-depth analysis of the positions of national parliaments and EU institutions is based on reports, resolutions, publicly available minutes and amendments to <b>draft</b> <b>conclusions</b> as well as other texts. This paper evaluates the agreement on the JPSG for Europol as promising. The second part of the Policy Paper presents concrete proposals in order to make the JPSG work efficiently: The JPSG should complement the existing scrutiny of Europol by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament and it should adopt ambitious Rules of Procedure at its first meeting in order to clarify and fix its internal functioning. The new body could subsequently become a blueprint for interparliamentary scrutiny in the EU...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Tropical {{infectious}} diseases are called neglected, because they are, inter alia, {{characterized by an}} R&D deficit. A similar deficit exists for rare (orphan) diseases which neither promise a sufficient return on R&D investment. To encourage the development of treatments for rare diseases, orphan drug acts were created which contain financial and non-financial incentives for the pharmaceutical industry. Similar instruments aimed exclusively at neglected diseases do not yet exist. Proposals for a regulatory approach to promote R&D for neglected diseases include the application of selected orphan drug incentives, or {{the implementation of a}} Medical Research and Development Treaty (MRDT) with national funding obligations for medical R&D. We compiled and analyzed experts' opinions on causes for the treatment deficit for neglected diseases and on desirable and feasible measures to promote neglected disease R&D. Hereby, the focus was on mechanisms contained in orphan drug regulations and in the Medical Research and Development Treaty draft (Discussion draft 4, 2005). Lastly, we solicited experts' opinions on the desirability and feasibility of a regulatory instrument to foster R&D for neglected diseases. Methods An international online-Delphi survey was conducted with 117 (first round) and 56 (second round) experts of different professional backgrounds and professional affiliations who formulated and ranked causes and solutions related to the treatment deficit for neglected diseases. Results In both rounds of survey, the majority of the participating experts (88. 4 % first round, 86. 8 % second round) advocated the development of a regulatory instrument to promote R&D for neglected diseases. Most experts (77. 9 % first round, 79. 3 % second round) also considered this to be a feasible option. With the exception of market exclusivity, which was viewed critically, key provisions contained in orphan drug regulations were judged favorably also for neglected diseases. A majority (87. 1 % first round, 77. 2 % second round) supported national funding obligations for neglected diseases which are proposed by the Medical Research and Development Treaty <b>draft.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> While not all features of orphan drug regulations and of the MRDT draft received equal support, the view was expressed that a regulatory instrument would be a desirable and feasible measure to promote R&D for neglected diseases. </p...|$|E

The sample groups represent professional CAD users (e. g. engineers, architects); university lecturers; Technology Education teachers and student teachers; and school students taking Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) Graphic Communication courses. An analysis of these personal views and attitudes indicates some common values between the various groups canvassed of what instruction in traditional manual technical drafting contributes towards learning. Themes emerge such as problem solving, visualisation, accuracy, co-ordination, use of standard conventions, personal discipline and artistry. In contrast to the assumptions of Prensky's thesis (2001 a&b) of digital natives, the study reported in this paper indicate that the school students apparently appreciate the experience of traditional <b>drafting.</b> In <b>conclusion,</b> the paper illustrates the perceived value of such learning in terms of transferable skills, personal achievement and enjoyment...|$|R

40|$|Background. Spinal schwannomas {{are common}} benign spinal tumors. Their {{treatment}} has significantly {{evolved over the}} years, and preserving neurological functions {{has become one of}} the main treatment goals together with tumor resection. Study Design and Aims. Retrospective review focused on clinical assessment, treatment techniques, and outcomes. Methods. A retrospective study on our surgical series was performed. Clinical and operative data were analyzed. In regard to neurophysiologic monitoring, patients were retrospectively divided into two groups comparing the outcomes before and after introduction of routine intraoperative neurophysiology tests. Results. From 1951 to 2010, 367 patients overall were treated. Diagnosis was obtained using angiography and/or myelography (pre-CT era), MRI, or CT scan. A posterior spinal approach was used for most patients; complex approaches were adopted for treatment of giant/dumbbell tumors. A trend of neurophysiology monitoring decreasing the rate of post-op neurological deficits was observed but was not statistically significant enough to <b>draft</b> evidence-based <b>conclusions.</b> Conclusions. Clinical and radiological assessment of spinal schwannomas has markedly changed over the course of 50 years. Diagnostic tools have improved, and detection of recurrence has become way more sensitive.
