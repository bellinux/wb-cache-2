500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> that she would visit if she could leave [...] "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E

2500|$|CNN also {{profiled}} Emily. University of Pennsylvania Physiology professor Kevin Foskett {{said in the}} article, [...] "Emily and {{her family}} want research focused on her mutation to be as focused and accelerated as possible. At one level, that sounds a little selfish, until you realize that her type of mutation, a 'nonsense' mutation ... is responsible for disease in many other genetically inherited forms of disease... Emily's story is compelling. [...] If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized." [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> in that piece, [...] "Obviously our prayer and dream {{is to have a}} breakthrough. [...] But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me. And I think that in the worst case scenario, even if it never could help me, there is a peace I get from at least knowing I'm doing everything I can, and it's not for lack of trying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to say that I did tell them to send it,' <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> 'but I <b>said</b> nothing about sealing, as Jane remembers, and I forgot that Maurice's {{gunpowder}} was in the room.' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Emily</b> Lakdawalla <b>said</b> {{that she}} relies on Universe Today and Bad Astronomy to [...] "give ... an {{independent}} look at big news stories".|$|R
60|$|The lady {{looked at}} <b>Emily,</b> who <b>said</b> nothing further; {{but she was}} still quite {{convinced}} that George Hotspur had not been at those Goodwood races.|$|R
2500|$|Emily and Emily's Entourage have {{received}} significant {{regional and national}} media coverage. The attention has driven donations as well research opportunities and public awareness. Philadelphia Magazine profiled Emily as a [...] "Health Hero" [...] in September 2015. [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My biggest motivations for working my hardest to stay as healthy as possible — {{even in the face}} of an advanced and progressing fatal illness — are my family and friends, this burning desire to do more things and see more places, and the unbelievable Entourage that rallied behind me to give me and so many others real, tangible hope for that chance." [...] People magazine wrote, [...] "Perhaps the most critical of Emily's Entourage's efforts has been its success in putting a beautiful face on an ugly issue. Case in point: The test tubes that fill the testing laboratories at USCF are all marked with random alphanumerical codes – except those marked with Emily's name." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> no more. She privately {{resolved}} to shorten her visit to Brighton.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{useless to}} ask me," [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Even {{the great man}} from Edinburgh {{is not able to}} decide yet, whether he will recover or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would {{make up your mind}} to have an 'it' for yourself," [...] <b>Emily</b> Dunstable <b>said</b> to her again that night; [...] "a nice 'it,' so that I could make a friend, perhaps a brother, of him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some journalists {{defended the}} science {{saying it is}} mostly correct, [...] "I haven’t seen any good {{evidence}} for serious factual errors," [...] <b>said</b> Kevin Drum. <b>Emily</b> Atkin <b>said</b> [...] "The complaints about the science in Wallace-Wells’s article are mostly quibbles".|$|R
5000|$|Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey P. Miller, and <b>Emily</b> Sherwin <b>said</b> {{that none}} of the {{contracts}} they researched had standalone waivers of class actions without arbitration clauses because, outside of arbitration clauses, class action waivers [...] "are legally vulnerable and also politically controversial".|$|R
6000|$|... "I've made it {{a proper}} dinner party," [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> comfortably; [...] "I {{thought it would be}} good {{practice}} for Imogen--she must get used to it now she's coming out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{might have}} {{told me she was}} tired," [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> to herself quietly. [...] "Well! the best thing I can do is to put out the light and follow her example." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, Mr. Wallingford, never!" [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said,</b> with emphasis, {{the instant}} her admirer {{was out of}} hearing. [...] "We are at his mercy, and must keep terms with him; but I can never marry a foreigner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing {{shows his}} sense so much,' <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> 'as his great {{attachment}} to papa--the {{only person who}} ever controlled him.' ...|$|R
25|$|Frontier {{convenor}} <b>Emily</b> Lau <b>said</b> {{the requirement}} for new appointees {{to agree with the}} chief executive's philosophy suggested the government was merely {{looking for a way to}} offer well-paid jobs to its supporters. Democratic Party chairman Lee Wing Tat said the proposal was tailor-made for the DAB.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear papa,' <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> 'Arabella knows--everybody here knows--Joe knows--that I was {{no party}} to this concealment. Augustus, for Heaven's sake, explain it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me {{for sending}} {{you on a}} needless errand," [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> to Mirabel; [...] "Miss de Sor tells me Mr. Morris has {{finished}} his sketch. She left him in the drawing-room--why didn't you bring him here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ALPHONSO, who in cool {{assurance}} all creation licks, He up {{and said}} to EMMIE (who had impudence for six), [...] "MISS EMILY, I love you--will you marry? Say the word!" [...] And <b>EMILY</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Certainly, ALPHONSO, like a bird!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{understood}} him. The diamonds might attract Mrs. Rook's notice; {{and in that}} case, {{she might}} ask to see the locket of her own accord. [...] "You are beginning to be of use to me, already," [...] <b>Emily</b> <b>said,</b> as they turned into the corridor {{which led to the}} waiting-room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We hope,' <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> 'that you and Mr. Weston will dine here on Tuesday. The Carringtons are coming, {{and a few}} others.' ...|$|R

50|$|Being {{the first}} Chairwoman of the party, <b>Emily</b> Lau <b>said</b> she hope to help {{strengthening}} the democratic movement, to see universal suffrage being implemented {{as soon as}} possible, and to take back party members' Home Return Permits. She also said her demand for dialogue with the central government remained unchanged.|$|R
60|$|The Duke of Derwent wanted {{many of the}} {{indispensable}} requisites of a husband, {{in the eyes of}} Mrs. Wilson; yet, as she thought Emily out of all danger at the present of any new attachment, she admitted the association, under no other restraint than the uniform propriety of all that <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> or did.|$|E
60|$|As {{she spoke}} Lily herself came in, {{the key of}} the {{storeroom}} in her hand, and looks of consternation on her face. She came to announce a terrible deficiency in the preserved quinces, which she herself had carefully put aside on a shelf in the storeroom, and which <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> she had not touched in her absence.|$|E
60|$|They all {{talked at}} once then, and Joseph tried {{all he could}} to persuade Emily {{to prove to the}} cook that 'is dreams didn't always come true; but it was no good. <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> she wouldn't marry 'im if he 'ad a million a year, and her aunt and uncle backed her up in it--to say nothing of Bert Simmons.|$|E

5000|$|Christian Music Zine <b>Emily</b> Kjonaas <b>said</b> {{that the}} album [...] "is by far their best work. Everyone who listens to {{it will be}} able to relate with several (or all) of these songs. This album {{encompasses}} a journey that all Christians resonate with and that is being human, and being a Believer." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{her younger}} days {{the teacher must}} have been a {{handsome}} woman. Her grandly-formed features still suggested the idea of imperial beauty--perhaps Jewish in its origin. When <b>Emily</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I never heard him speak of you," [...] the color flew into her pallid cheeks: her dim eyes became alive again with a momentary light. She left her seat on the bed, and, turning away, mastered the emotion that shook her.|$|E
6000|$|That was {{the only}} formal blessing she left among us. Indeed, the last time I saw her was with an {{ordinary}} good-night {{at the foot of}} the stairs. <b>Emily</b> <b>said</b> she was glad that I had not to carry with me the remembrance of those paroxysms of suffering. My dear Emily had alone the whole force of that trial--or shall I call it privilege? [...] Martyn did not reach home till some hours after all was over, poor boy.|$|E
6000|$|The two {{families}} {{were supposed to}} continue on unbroken terms of friendship, and we men did so; but Mrs. Fordyce told my mother that she had disapproved of the probation, and Mrs. Winslow was hurt. [...] Though the two girls were allowed to be together as usual, it was on condition of silence about Griff; and though, as <b>Emily</b> <b>said,</b> they really had not been always talking about him in former times, the prohibition seemed to weigh upon all they said.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Mosey was too resolutely bent on asserting her own importance, {{by making}} the most of the alarm that she had suffered, to be {{repressed}} by any ordinary method of remonstrance. Without paying the slightest attention to what <b>Emily</b> had <b>said,</b> she went on again more loudly and more excitably than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you believe}} it really happened?' <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> 'that some terrible scene is being acted over again. Oh! but can it be the real spirits!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{want you}} to come," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Emily,</b> [...] "because {{there has been some}} family reconciliation. You usually do go once or twice a year." ...|$|R
