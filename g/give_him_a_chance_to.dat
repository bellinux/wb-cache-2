5|$|After some time, Kate speaks at an AA meeting, celebrating {{one year}} of sobriety, while Charlie gets in trouble for riding a bicycle while drunk. Kate visits Charlie and they play croquet. Charlie asks if she would move back in with him if he begins going to AA meetings. Kate says he must get sober for himself, not for her. Charlie then asks Kate to play another round, to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> redeem himself. The film ends before Kate gives her answer.|$|E
25|$|The next tour game, against Barbados, was a draw. Ogilvie was {{selected}} to play {{even though he did}} not arrive in Barbados until {{the second day of the}} match, in order to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> make the test eleven. Australia batted well, with both Serjeant and Simpson scoring centuries, with half centuries to Wood, Darling and Ogilvie.|$|E
25|$|With his arm injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. He looked for {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner was willing to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play ball again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E

25|$|After four days, Scott {{began to}} pretend that he had changed his mind, feigning tears and remorse, {{in the hope that}} this would in due course <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> escape. The final day of his {{imprisonment}} he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that they all went out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment. Initially, the charges were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United's team {{selection}} {{was dominated by}} the need to save several players for the Champions League final against Bayern Munich four days later. Midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes were suspended for the Champions League final, so they were paired in central midfield for the FA Cup final as the swansong for their season; their deputy for the Champions League final, Nicky Butt, was left out of the matchday squad entirely to guard him against injury. Top scorer Dwight Yorke was dropped to the bench for a similar reason, while first-choice centre-back Jaap Stam was named among the substitutes to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove his fitness after an Achilles tendon injury. Denis Irwin missed the match due to suspension after being sent off against Liverpool in the Premier League on 5 May and was replaced in the starting line-up by Phil Neville. Several players, including Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville, were suffering from a flu virus in the lead-up to the game, and were still suffering the effects on matchday, but were all deemed fit enough to play. Henning Berg was injured.|$|E
25|$|In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma {{was bought}} by the Deccan Chargers; he hoped that his {{performance}} in the competition would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> impress selectors and push for selection in India's ODI team. From 12matches, Sharma took 11wickets {{at an average of}} 28.54. A month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests. Several senior players were rested from the ODI side and others absent through injury; this mostly affected the batsmen but Zaheer Khan missed the ODI series. India won the first three ODIs, and Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. He managed one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109runs. The first Test resulted in a win for India and Sharma took three wickets in each innings. He claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth youngest to reach the landmark; the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. The second and third Tests ended in draws and India won the series 1–0; Sharma was the leading wicket-taker on either side with 22dismissals at an average of 16.86.|$|E

25|$|Having {{overcome}} initial {{reservations about}} leaving {{his wife and}} newly-born son, Hobbs accepted the invitation but throughout the voyage to Australia was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which was to afflict him throughout his life. To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed {{the first two games}} of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs a good player. He also believed that Jones did not <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, {{not a member of the}} touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket; before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket.|$|E

500|$|After {{five seasons}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{production}} of The X-Files moved to Los Angeles.

Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move, but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California.

500|$|... "The Beginning" [...] was {{the first}} episode to be filmed in Los Angeles, California.

As a result of the move, the episode featured a largely new group of crew members, hired by Carter, Frank Spotnitz and new co-executive producer Michael Watkins. The show's crew had to spend five weeks unpacking and cataloging material from the Vancouver film crew. Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew, both series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move, although less vocally than Duchovny.|$|E
500|$|After Daniel's {{death and}} Jonas's {{subsequent}} move to Earth, Major Carter is the SG-1 team member around whom Jonas Quinn feels most comfortable. Nevertheless, Amanda Tapping (Carter) felt that [...] "there is a hesitancy on 's part {{to be too}} familiar with Jonas [...] make this big emotional investment" [...] in him {{because he is not}} Daniel. Jonas hopes that Carter and the alien SG-1 member Teal'c can persuade Colonel O'Neill to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> prove himself worthy of a place on the SG-1 team, but according to Richard Dean Anderson (O'Neill), [...] "O'Neill feels that Jonas is directly responsible for the demise or at least the damaging of Daniel Jackson [...] harbors some resentment towards Jonas". Although O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general (except of Teal'c), O'Neill begins to accept Jonas at the end of [...] "Redemption" [...] yet finds it hard to ever significantly warm up to Jonas, something which Nemec felt [...] "makes things much more interesting". Tapping added that Jonas inadvertently brings the three remaining SG-1 members closer together again. Jonas's [...] "easy-going nature" [...] later helps him to also establish relationships with the supporting characters Dr. Janet Fraiser and General George Hammond, whom Nemec regarded [...] "very much [...] a father figure in Jonas's eyes".|$|E
