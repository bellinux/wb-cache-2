40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a complex, chronic {{and progressive}} disease and rehabilitation services can provide important support to patients. Few MS rehabilitation {{programs have been}} shown to provide health improvements to patients in a cost-effective manner. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the effects in terms of changes measured by a variety of standardized quality of life, mastery, coping, compliance and individual goal-related endpoints. This combination provides the basis for analyzing the complexity of MS and outcomes of a personalized rehabilitation. Methods/Design Patients with MS referred to <b>hospital</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> will be randomized to either early admission (within two months) or usual admission (after an average waiting time of eight months). They will complete a battery of standardized health outcome instruments prior to randomization, and again six and twelve months after randomization, and a battery of goal-related outcome measures at admission and discharge, and again one, six and twelve months after randomization. Discussion The results of the study are expected to contribute to further development of MS rehabilitation services and to discussions about the design and content of such services. The results will also provide additional information to health authorities responsible for providing and financing rehabilitation services.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, there has been {{increasing}} emphasis on the social element of the treatment of chronic psychiatric patients. This {{has led to the}} development of mental health services in the community, outside the traditional psychiatric <b>hospital.</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>services,</b> in particular, have played a major role in the return ofpart of the long-stay psychiatric population to the community and in the prevention of social disablement. Most approaches of psychiatric rehabilitation are based on the components of occuoetionet rehabilitation and residential care. This article attempts to review the major studies and models of vocational rehabilitation and to evaluate the role of work in the rehabilitation process. The basic principles and stages of rehabilitation are also briefly discussed. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 'Care is no cure, but rather corrosive for things that are not to be remedied ' (Henry VI) These lines, written by Shakespeare in the 17 th century, seem totally different to the philosophy which lies behind the planning of community services at the end of the 20 th century. The treatment of psychiatric symptoms is no longer considered to be the sine qua non for mental health professionals. Prevention and treatment of secondary disabilities, such as social disablement, are equally important. Tuke initiated rehabilitation in the UK in the early 19 th century with his moral treatment/occupational approach. The first experiments of rehabilitation in this century date back t...|$|E

40|$|Background: Communication {{difficulties}} due to aphasia {{following stroke}} are particularly stressful to caregivers. Objective: To examine {{the impact of}} a psychoeducation programme on caregivers' burden and stress and communication between the caregiver and aphasic stroke patient. Design: Randomized wait-list controlled trial with immediate or three-month delayed treatment. Setting: Three public <b>hospital</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> in Sydney, Australia. Subjects: Thirty-nine caregivers of aphasic stroke patients, up to 12 months post stroke: 19 given immediate treatment and 20 in a delayed treatment control group. Interventions: Four-session weekly caregiver programme that included elements of education, support and communication skills conducted by a speech pathologist, social worker and clinical psychologist. Main measures: The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to measure caregiver stress, the Relatives' Stress Scale was used to measure caregiver burden and a communication questionnaire was designed specifically for this project. Results: Thirty-one caregivers completed the study. Caregivers in the immediate treatment group had significant reductions in GHQ measured stress (GHQ mean (SD) at baseline= 6. 26 (5. 67), GHQ post treatment 3. 21 (SD 4. 20), P = 0. 006). There was no improvement in wait-listed caregivers. Improvement was not maintained at three-month follow-up. There were no significant effects of the programme on communication skills or on caregiver burden. Conclusions: Stroke caregiver support, education and training programmes have short-term effects on caregiver stress levels but are likely to require ongoing involvement to maintain their effect...|$|E

Background and objective Although trials continue to emerge supporting the role of telerehabilitation, implementation has been slow. Key users include older people living with disabilities who are frequent users of <b>hospital</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> but whose voices are rarely heard. It is unclear whether the use of technologies and reduced face-to-face contact is acceptable to these people. We report on a qualitative study of community dwelling participants who had received a home telerehabilitation programme as an alternative to conventional rehabilitation. Design Thirteen older participants, three spouses and one carer were interviewed. All had participated in an individualized therapy programme, using a combination of face-to-face and video consults with therapists. The programme used ‘off-the-shelf’ technologies including iPads for videoconferencing and electronic FitBitR devices. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NVivo software. Results Thematic analysis resulted in five emergent themes: (i) telerehabilitation is convenient; (ii) telerehabilitation promotes motivation and self-awareness; (iii) telerehabilitation fosters positive therapeutic relationships; (iv) mastering technologies used by younger relatives is a valued aspect of telerehabilitation; and (v) Telerehabilitation does not replace traditional face-to-face rehabilitation therapies. Conclusions Participants found telerehabilitation convenient and motivating, coped well with the technology and developed positive therapeutic relationships. The learning and practice aspects sat well in the context of a rehabilitation programme. The use of commercially available technologies may have contributed to respondents' high levels of acceptability. The perception of telerehabilitation as complementary to in-person care and the expectation of technological support have implications for the implementation and delivery of telerehabilitation services to older people...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{decision}} analysis model, we estimated the savings {{that might be}} derived from a mass prenatal screening program aimed at detecting open neural tube defects (NTDs) in low-risk pregnancies.

When a more liberal estimate of the costs of caring for such a child was used, the savings with the screening program were more substantial. We performed extensive sensitivity analyses, which showed that the savings were somewhat sensitive to the cost of the MSAFP test and highly sensitive to the specificity (but not the sensitivity) of the test.

40|$|In Australia, {{the legal}} {{basis for the}} {{detention}} and restraint of people with intellectual impairment is ad hoc and unclear. There is no comprehensive legal framework that authorises and regulates the detention of, for example, older people with dementia in locked wards or in residential aged care, people with disability in residential services or people with acquired brain injury in <b>hospital</b> and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services.</b> This paper focuses on whether the common law doctrine of necessity (or its statutory equivalents) should {{have a role in}} permitting the detention and restraint of people with disabilities. Traditionally, the defence of necessity has been recognised as an excuse, where the defendant, faced by a situation of imminent peril, is excused from the criminal or civil liability because of the extraordinary circumstances they find themselves in. In the United Kingdom, however, in In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) and R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust, ex parte L, the House of Lords broadened the defence so that it operated as a justification for treatment, detention and restraint outside of the emergency context. This paper outlines the distinction between necessity as an excuse and as a defence, and identifies a number of concerns with the latter formulation: problems of democracy, integrity, obedience, objectivity and safeguards. Australian courts are urged to reject the United Kingdom approach and retain an excuse-based defence, as the risks of permitting the essentially utilitarian model of necessity as a justification are too great...|$|R
