5|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his <b>express</b> <b>authority.</b> Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{added an}} annotation, [...] "It {{is not to}} be {{released}} on Japan without <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> from the President", as President Harry S. Truman was waiting to see the effects of the first two attacks. On August 13, the third bomb was scheduled. It was anticipated that it would be ready by August 16 to be dropped on August 19. This was pre-empted by Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, while preparations were still being made for it to be couriered to Kirtland Field. The third core remained at Los Alamos.|$|E
500|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb ready for use on August 19, with three more in September and a further three in October. On August 10, he sent a memorandum to Marshall in which he wrote that [...] "the next bomb... should be ready for delivery on the first suitable weather after 17 or 18 August." [...] On the same day, Marshall endorsed the memo with the comment, [...] "It {{is not to be}} released over Japan without <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> from the President." [...] Truman had secretly requested this on August 10. This modified the previous order that the target cities were to be attacked with atomic bombs [...] "as made ready".|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} the King's own {{position}} {{in relation to the}} law, and his authority to decide this matter, was brought up, in {{what became known as the}} Case of Prohibitions. James stated that [...] "In cases where there is not <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> in law, the King may himself decide in his royal person; the Judges are but delegates of the King". Coke challenged this, saying [...] "the King in his own person cannot adjudge any case, either criminal - as treason, felony etc, or betwixt party and party; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice, according to the Law and Custom of England". Coke further stated that [...] "The common law protecteth the King", to which James replied [...] "The King protecteth the law, and not the law the King! The King maketh judges and bishops. If the judges interpret the laws themselves and suffer none else to interpret, they may easily make, of the laws, shipmen's hose!". Coke rejected this, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; he pointed out that such knowledge [...] "demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it". Victorious, Coke freely left, and continued to issue writs of prohibition against the High Commission.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor Roy Goode in the Law Quarterly Review. [...] Goode {{argued that the}} case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> to pay on the cheque, it had implied authority; secondly, that the payee had changed their position and so {{should have had a}} good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of subrogation. [...] Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution, or on banking law.|$|E
2500|$|The Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) are the {{two main}} sources of EU law. Representing {{agreements}} between all member states, the TEU focuses more on principles of democracy, human rights, and summarises the institutions, while the TFEU expands on all principles and fields of policy in which the EU can legislate. In principle, the EU treaties are like any other international agreement, which will usually be interpreted according to principles codified by the Vienna Convention 1969. It can be amended by unanimous agreement at any time, but TEU itself, in article 48, sets out an amendment procedure through proposals via the Council and a Convention of national Parliament representatives. Under TEU article 5(2), the [...] "principle of conferral" [...] says the EU can do nothing except the things which it has <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> to do. The limits of its competence are governed by the Court of Justice, and the courts and Parliaments of member states.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the District {{sued the}} Commonwealth of Pennsylvania {{regarding}} underfunding and payment of the District's outstanding debts.

The District agrees that it will undertake activities set forth in the Settlement Agreement to improve its special education programs, including adding personnel and development and implementation of a new or revised Special Education Plan. The Commonwealth also agrees that it will appoint a Special Education Officer located in the District with <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> to ensure that students with disabilities in the CUSD receive a free appropriate public education".

2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|E

60|$|From time immemorial, {{in modern}} Christendom at least, {{it had been}} the general opinion of learned and simple alike that every species of plant or animal owed its present form and its {{original}} existence to a distinct act of special creation. This naïf belief, unsupported as it was by any sort of internal evidence, was supposed to rest directly upon the <b>express</b> <b>authority</b> of a few obscure statements in the Book of Genesis. The Creator, it was held, had in the beginning formed each kind after a particular pattern, had endowed it with special organs devised with supreme wisdom for subserving special functions, and had bestowed upon it the mystical power of reproducing its like in its own image to all generations. No variation of importance ever occurred within the types thus constituted; all plants and animals always retained their special forms unaltered in any way from era to era.

60|$|In {{writing the}} series of {{historical}} narratives to which the present work pertains, {{it has been the}} object of the author to furnish to the reading community of this country an accurate and faithful account of the lives and actions of the several personages that are made successively the subjects of the volumes, following precisely the story which has come down to us from ancient times. The writer has spared no pains to gain access in all cases to the original sources of information, and has confined himself strictly to them. The reader may, therefore, feel assured in perusing any one of these works, that the interest of it is in no degree indebted to the invention of the author. No incident, however trivial, is ever added to the original account, nor are any words even, in any case, attributed to a speaker without <b>express</b> <b>authority.</b> Whatever of interest, therefore, these stories may possess, is due solely to the facts themselves which are recorded in them, and to their being brought together in a plain, simple, and connected narrative.|$|E

Put another way, in The Power of the Texas Governor: Connally to Bush, McCall, who equates power to “a social game,” boldly claims that the Texas governorship stands as among the best laboratories for any study of human behavior. McCall attempts to use that laboratory to make a claim about the effectiveness and legacies {{of the men and women}} who have served in the highest elected office in the Lone Star State since 1962, current Texas Governor Rick Perry excluded.
