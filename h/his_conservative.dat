5|$|In 2006, before George W. Bush appointees Roberts and Alito had {{had time}} to make an impact, Rossum wrote that Scalia had failed to win {{converts}} among <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> colleagues for his use of originalism, whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in.|$|E
5|$|In the campaign, Hunter {{emphasized}} <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> credentials, {{focusing on}} the issues of border security, the War on Terrorism, and trade. Throughout 2007, he was in the second tier of Republican candidates, consistently receiving three percent or less support among Republicans in national polls. However, the campaign reached a high point after Hunter won the Texas Straw Poll.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} chemist {{before becoming}} a barrister, Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in <b>his</b> <b>Conservative</b> government. In 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition {{and became the first}} woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election.|$|E
5000|$|On David Cameron {{being elected}} as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after {{coalition}} talks between <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and the Liberal Democrats concluded on 11 May 2010, President Obama {{was the first}} foreign leader to offer his congratulations.

50|$|The museum {{seen as a}} microcosm. This is both a theater, {{with its}} stage and behind the scenes, and an anthill with <b>his</b> queen (<b>Conservative),</b> <b>his</b> {{soldiers}} (guards) her workers (handlers) and aphids (visitors).|$|R
50|$|On Aurora, {{there is}} also concern, but the Aurorans decide that the threat cannot be serious. They use authoritarian methods to {{suppress}} Ion Mereanu and <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> who wish to help Earth. They then call a gathering on Hesperus, one of the Outer Worlds, to unite them against Earth.|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> {{opposition to abortion}} to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As a proponent of both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and {{the architect of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.|$|E
5|$|His {{confrontations}} with conservatives cost him several leadership {{positions in the}} Senate, including chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. Despite isolation from <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> colleagues, Mathias played an influential role in fostering African American civil rights, ending the Vietnam War, preserving the Chesapeake Bay, and constructing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He retired from the Senate in 1987, having served in Congress for twenty-six years (eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate).|$|E
50|$|The Canadian federal {{election}} of 1874 {{was held on}} January 22, 1874, to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 3rd Parliament of Canada. Sir John A. Macdonald, who had recently been forced out of office as prime minister, and <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives</b> were defeated by the Liberal Party under their new leader Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie.|$|R
50|$|Cramer was {{a long-time}} {{member of the}} Blue Dog Democrats, a {{coalition}} of conservative and moderate House Democrats. Because of <b>his</b> largely <b>conservative</b> positions, he was encouraged by fellow Alabama politician Sen. Richard Shelby {{to make the same}} switch that he did and register as a Republican. Cramer has resisted these efforts, and won reelection easily in <b>his</b> increasingly <b>conservative</b> district despite <b>his</b> party affiliation.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a vote may be {{free for}} some parties {{but not for}} others. For instance, when the Conservative {{government}} of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper proposed a motion to re-open the debate on Canada's same-sex marriage laws, <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and the opposition Liberals declared it a free vote for their members, while the Bloc Québécois and the New Democrats both maintained party discipline to defeat the measure.|$|R
5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election was called for 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to <b>his</b> <b>Conservative</b> opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was also}} an elitist and {{encouraged}} {{the emergence of an}} elite class in Kenya. He wrestled with a contradiction between <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace Western modernity. He also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on Kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised Kenyan nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Skelton {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey {{was not as}} {{conservative}} as the Republican-controlled 80th Congress, which also proved problematic for him. Truman tied Dewey to the [...] "do-nothing" [...] Congress. Indeed, Dewey had successfully battled Taft and <b>his</b> <b>conservatives</b> for the nomination at the Republican Convention. Taft had remained a non-interventionist even through the Second World War. Dewey, however, supported the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, recognition of Israel, and the Berlin airlift.|$|R
50|$|While Harper was handily re-elected to this {{riding in}} the 2015 election, <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives</b> lost their bid for a fresh mandate. New Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's {{swearing-in}} on November 4, 2015 marked the official end of Harper's premiership. Harper resigned as MP for Calgary Heritage on August 26, 2016. A by-election to fill the seat was held on April 3, 2017; Bob Benzen retained it for the Conservatives.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; {{one of his}} staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently made fun of <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E
5|$|At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Metternich and <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> allies had {{reestablished}} the Spanish monarchy under King Ferdinand VII. Over {{the following}} forty years, {{the great powers}} supported the Spanish monarchy, but events in 1868 would further test the old system. A revolution in Spain overthrew Queen Isabella II, and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris. The Spanish, looking for a suitable Catholic successor, had offered the post to three European princes, each of whom was rejected by Napoleon III, who served as regional power-broker. Finally, in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line. The ensuing furor has been dubbed by historians as the Hohenzollern candidature.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E
50|$|That same month, Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claude Williams {{reiterated that}} the fares would remain. Many islanders {{felt that the}} {{government}} had reneged on its promise, and that the matter would become an election issue. The impact of this is unclear, but Alward's mandate ended in 2014 with the fees still in place, and <b>his</b> <b>Conservatives</b> were defeated at the polls by the Liberal Party, led by Brian Gallant.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>his</b> {{supposed}} <b>conservative</b> {{economic policies}} and family {{ties to the}} Mitsubishi interests made him unpopular with the leftist movement.|$|R

5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, in spite of <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of}} his ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. Liberals in both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|John Jeremy Thorpe {{was born}} in 1929, the son and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs. After school at Eton, he studied law at Trinity College, Oxford, where, having decided on a political career, he devoted his main energies to making a personal impact rather than to his studies. Rejecting <b>his</b> <b>Conservative</b> background, he joined the small, centrist Liberal Party, by the late 1940s a declining force in British politics but still offering a national platform and a challenge to an ambitious young politician. He became secretary, and eventually president, of the university's Liberal Club, and met many of the party's leading figures. In the Hilary term (January–March) of 1950–51 Thorpe {{served as president of}} the Oxford Union.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> {{political}} views. In the 1970s, {{he was chairman of}} the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E

5|$|The post of a Whip {{normally}} required {{silence in}} the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved in a}} difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and <b>his</b> <b>Conservative</b> opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing <b>his</b> <b>conservative</b> voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and <b>his</b> <b>Conservative</b> (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
