5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to}} be thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{under the supervision of}} Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E

He said that {{he just wanted to}} visit some friends and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> When asked by a reporter whether Henry Ford was a financial supporter of the effort to restore the monarchy in Russia, Boris did not know who Henry Ford was. His brother, Grand Duke Kyril, wanted to restore the Russian monarchy and in 1924 proclaimed himself czar-in-exile, but Boris was largely uninterested in politics.|$|E

25|$|Kwaito is a {{political}} and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time.</b> Kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people, but it is now sweeping the nation. The main consumers of Kwaito are adolescents {{and half of the}} South African population is under 21. Some of the large Kwaito artists have sold more than 100,000 albums, and in an industry where 25,000 albums sold is considered a gold record, those are impressive numbers.

These include Tumi, Ben Sharpa, HipHop Pantsula, Tuks Senganga.|$|E

Less than a year after the program launched, NBC had premiered I'm Telling!, Lorimar Television had announced plans for Fun House, and Nickelodeon's Finders Keepers began airingall shows based on competition between teams of children. During Double Dares first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including Hollywood Squares and The Cross-Wits were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that Double Dare [...] "allowed kids to get dirty and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> in ways that really were not acceptable before that show". Double Dare remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.|$|E

Just <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> and do a little business. And that's the way Washington works."
