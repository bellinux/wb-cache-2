2500|$|A quality {{general-purpose}} electronics DMM {{is generally}} considered adequate for measurements at signal levels greater than one millivolt or one microampere, or below about 100 megohms; [...] these values are far from the theoretical limits of sensitivity, and are of considerable interest in some circuit design situations. Other instruments—essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity—are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include nanovoltmeters, electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very <b>high</b> <b>source</b> resistance, such as one teraohm) and picoammeters. [...] Accessories for more typical multimeters permit some of these measurements, as well. Such measurements are limited by available technology, and ultimately by inherent thermal noise.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficiency}} of the detectors is <b>higher</b> at low <b>source</b> energies (absorption coefficient is very high) and decreases as the energy increases (fall off in the absorption coefficient), because the photoelectricity is dominant below 100  keV, which means in other words that it is higher for the bigger detector or low source distance than the smaller one or <b>higher</b> <b>source</b> distance. It is <b>higher</b> for lower <b>source</b> energy than <b>higher</b> <b>source</b> energy because of {{the dominance of the}} photoelectricity at lower source energies.|$|R

60|$|Such are the {{principal}} modes in which the ideas of power may become a dangerous attraction to the artist--a false test to the critic. But in all cases where they lead us astray it will be found that the error is caused by our preferring victory over a small apparent difficulty to victory over a great, but concealed one; and so that we keep this distinction constantly in view, (whether with reference to execution or to any other quality of art,) between the sensation and the intellectual estimate of power, we shall always find the ideas of power a just and <b>high</b> <b>source</b> of pleasure in every kind and grade of art.|$|E

60|$|There was a {{burst of}} tears again, and Marian felt herself an {{unsuccessful}} comforter, nor did she wonder at it, for she could not fancy that anything could relieve the sense of such a misfortune as poor Lionel's, except the really <b>high</b> <b>source</b> of consolation, and that as yet only by faith, which might make him take it on trust as {{the best in the}} end, though for the present he must feel all the misery. She had no time to answer him again, for the garden door opened, and at the sound he dashed away his tears, sprang to his feet, and assumed a firm, cold, would-be indifferent look, as Mrs. Lyddell came out and advanced towards them. Marian thought her looking flushed and agitated, and her voice certainly betrayed more emotion than had ever been shown in it, except when bidding Johnny farewell.|$|E
60|$|People {{may well}} cry out against this theory of {{sleep on the}} grounds that all the grotesque, monstrous and {{objectionable}} dreams which plague us cannot possibly come from a <b>high</b> <b>source.</b> On this point I have a very definite theory, which may perhaps be worthy of discussion. I consider that there are two forms of dreams, and only two, the experiences of the released spirit, and the confused action of the lower faculties which remain in the body when the spirit is absent. The former is rare and beautiful, for the memory of it fails us. The latter are common and varied, but usually fantastic or ignoble. By noting what is absent in the lower dreams one can tell what the missing qualities are, and so judge what part of us goes to make up the spirit. Thus in these dreams humour is wanting, since we see things which strike us afterwards as ludicrous, and are not amused. The sense of proportion and of judgment and of aspiration is all gone. In short, the higher is palpably gone, and the lower, the sense of fear, of sensual impression, of self-preservation, is functioning all the more vividly because it is relieved from the higher control.|$|E
60|$|Nay, but, you say, we {{ourselves}} {{shall not be}} benefited by the sculpture on the outsides of our houses. Yes, you will, and in an extraordinary degree; for, observe farther, that architecture differs from painting peculiarly in being an art of accumulation. The prints bought by your friends, and hung up in their houses, have no collateral effect with yours: they must be separately examined, and if ever they were hung side by side, they would rather injure than assist each other's effect. But the sculpture on your friend's house unites in effect with that on your own. The two houses form one grand mass--far grander than either separately; much more if a third be added--and a fourth; much more if the whole street--if the whole city--join in the solemn harmony of sculpture. Your separate possessions of pictures and prints are to you as if you sang pieces of music with your single voices in your own houses. But your architecture would be as if you all sang together in one mighty choir. In the separate picture, it is rare that there exists any very <b>high</b> <b>source</b> of sublime emotion; but the great concerted music of {{the streets of the}} city, when turret rises over turret, and casement frowns beyond casement, and tower succeeds to tower along the farthest ridges of the inhabited hills,--this is a sublimity of which you can at present form no conception; and capable, I believe, of exciting almost the deepest emotion that art can ever strike from the bosoms of men.|$|E
