40|$|Background: A {{modified}} laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic {{sludge blanket}} (UASB) reactor {{was used to}} obtain methane by treating hydrous ethanol vinasse. Vinasses or stillage are waste materials with high organic loads, and a complex composition resulting from the process of alcohol distillation. They must initially be treated with anaerobic processes due to their high organic loads. Vinasses can be considered multipurpose waste for energy recovery and once treated {{they can be used}} in agriculture without the risk of polluting soil, underground water or crops. In this sense, treatment of vinasse combines the elimination of organic waste with the formation of methane. Biogas is considered as a promising renewable energy source. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the optimum organic loading rate for operating a modified UASB reactor to treat vinasse generated in the production of hydrous ethanol from sugar cane molasses. Results: The study showed that chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 69 % at an optimum organic loading rate (OLR) of 17. 05 kg COD/m 3 -day, achieving a methane yield of 0. 263 m 3 /kg CODadded and a biogas methane content of 84 %. During this stage, effluent characterization presented lower values than the vinasse, except for potassium, sulfide and ammonia nitrogen. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>primers</b> used to amplify the 16 S-rDNA genes for the domains Archaea and Bacteria showed the presence of microorganisms which favor methane production at the optimum organic loading rate. Conclusions: The modified UASB reactor proposed in this study provided a successful treatment of the vinasse obtained from hydrous ethanol production. Methanogen groups (Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales) detected by PCR during operational optimum OLR of the modified UASB reactor, favored methane production...|$|R

In our <b>hands</b> these <b>primers</b> {{do not appear to}} discriminate between tooth fungi and other wood decay species. Therefore PCR primers were designed that discriminated Creolophus cirrhatus from other species (HER 2 F/HER 3 R), and which discriminate Hericium alpestre, H. coralloides and H. erinaceus from other wood decay Ascomycota and Basidiomycota but not from each other (HER 2 F/HER 2 R). Using the HER 2 F/HER 3 R primers together with traditional isolation and direct incubation procedures, the location of C. cirrhatus in Turkey oak logs was mapped. The PCR approach often detected C. cirrhatus in locations where it was suspected to be, based on patterns of staining and decay, but where it was not revealed by isolation onto agar media, emphasising the value of adopting several approaches to unravel fungal community structure in wood...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} virus subtype identification {{is critical for}} accurate diagnosis of human infections, effective response to epidemic outbreaks and global-scale surveillance of highly pathogenic viral subtypes such as avian influenza H 5 N 1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the method of choice for virus subtype identification. However, designing subtype-specific PCR primer pairs is a very challenging task: on one <b>hand,</b> selected <b>primer</b> pairs must result in robust amplification {{in the presence of}} a significant degree of sequence heterogeneity within subtypes, on the other, they must discriminate between the subtype of interest and closely related subtypes. In this article, we present a new tool, called PrimerHunter, that can be used to select highly sensitive and specific primers for virus subtyping. Our tool takes as input sets of both target and nontarget sequences. Primers are selected such that they efficiently amplify any one of the target sequences, and none of the nontarget sequences. PrimerHunter ensures the desired amplification properties by using accurate estimates of melting temperature with mismatches, computed based on the nearest neighbor model via an efficient fractional programming algorithm. Validation experiments with three avian influenza HA subtypes confirm that primers selected by PrimerHunter have high sensitivity and specificity for target sequences. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|If {{there is}} a book that invites re-appropriation, it is Bertolt Brecht’s {{relatively}} little known War Primer (1955), composed of photographs clipped from daily press accompanied by enigmatic epigrams. In a witty act of mimicry, the artist duo Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin composed War Primer 2 (2011) by superimposing a heterogeneous selection of images pertaining to the so-called War on Terror onto the original pages of Brecht’s book. By focusing on images in which the photographic act is made the explicit theme of the photograph, their book reflects on practices of making and disseminating images of violence. On the one <b>hand,</b> War <b>Primer</b> 2 aims to disrupt the firmly entrenched imaginative geographies of the War on Terror. On the other, it casts a different light on the performative character of photographic imagery.

40|$|Two sets of {{oligonucleotide}} primers (1008 PS- 1009 PR and 1010 PLS- 1011 PLR) were designed {{according to the}} sequence of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene of Quebec reference strain IAF-exp 91 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The primers were used in reverse transcription and PCR (RT-PCR) experiments for detection of viral genomic RNA either from infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) or tissues from experimentally infected specific-pathogen-free pigs. Considering {{the high degree of}} variation detected between the nucleotide sequences of the N genes of IAF-exp 91 and Lelystad virus (LV) strains of PRRSV, the primers 1008 PS- 1009 PR were referred to as the specific primers, since they were chosen in such a manner that they could amplify only sequences from IAF-exp 91 RNA and not from LV. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>primer</b> pair 1010 PLS- 1011 PLR was common to both strains of PRRSV. When analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the products of RT-PCR from each set of primers were resolved as single band of the predicted size, the specificity of amplified products being confirmed by Southern blotting with a specific IAF-exp 91 N gene probe. No amplification was observed when RNA was extracted from uninfected PAM or from other porcine viruses. As expected, only the common primer pair was able to amplify RNA from the Quebec reference strain and two European strains (LV and Weybridge). The resulting bands displayed differences in electrophoretic mobilities due to the absence of 37 nucleotides in both European strains, thus allowing their differentiation from the IAF-exp 91 strain. Most of the tissue culture-adapted Quebec isolates were detected with both primer pairs. The sensitivity of the enzymatic amplification method for detection of PRRSV from lung tissues was a 50 % tissue culture infective dose of 5. RT-PCR was found to be more sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence assay for detection of PRRSV in tissues from experimentally infected pigs and as sensitive as virus isolation in PAM, especially when combined with Southern blotting with the digoxigenin-labeled N probe and chemiluminescence detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{study focused}} on two main topics. On the one <b>hand</b> <b>primers</b> and a PCR {{protocol}} were developed to find a suitable housekeeping gene for quantitative real-time PCR. On the other hand this study explored the expression of genes related to an immune response in cell cultures and organs of living fish. The main focus lay on the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC has been studied for several years. This is {{mainly because of the}} central role of MHC molecules in the adaptive immune response and the high number of different alleles in vertebrate populations. Recent research suggests that – in addition to the variation in sequences of the genetic code – genetically based variations in expression of MHC genes do {{play a crucial role in}} evolutionary change. Up to now it has been shown that expression is heritable, i. e. expression has a genetic basis in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Furthermore a negative correlation, which suggests a compensatory regulation of MHC genes, between expression levels and number of different MHC alleles has been shown. A positive correlation between MHC expression and parasite load has been shown as well. To date, research has focused on beta-actin as a housekeeping gene in expression analysis on Gasterosteus aculeatus. Recent research in other taxa suggests that beta-actin is not the most stable gene depending on the tissue and the taxa of the survey. In the study primers were developed in order to measure gene expression of candidate housekeeping genes and the immune response genes. Therefore sequences from the EST-library and the whole genome shotgun library of the stickleback have been used to find exon-intron boundaries. The mRNA has been amplified in a PCR reaction and the product has been sequenced to check the identity of the PCR product. Ten candidate genes including beta-actin were tested for stable gene expression in three different tissues and under several treatments. The data showed that beta-actin is a good housekeeping gene in most of the tissues and treatments, but other genes proved to be more stably expressed. As it was one of the most stable genes in all examined tissues, especially the L 13 a ribosomal binding protein seems to be a good candidate to replace beta-actin as a general housekeeping gene for expression analysis. In another experiment the expression of MHC genes was stimulated in cell cultures with lysates of two widespread parasites of the three-spined stickleback, i. e. Diplostomum pseudospathacaeum and Camallanus lacustris. In order to enhance comparability, cells from the same organ have been infected in these cultures. Therefore RNA-Extraction and realtime PCR were improved in a way that allowed us to measure gene expression and controls in 15 different PCR runs from only 105 cells. While MHC expression was higher in cells of formerly infected fish, no effect of cell treatment could have been shown. However the cell’s survival rate was higher in cultures that were infected with parasite lysate. Furthermore gene expression was measured at five times after being infected with Diplostomum pseudospathacaeum to explore the expression of genes correlated to immune response during the first eleven days. 1.

40|$|A {{challenge}} for laboratories {{is to provide}} bacterial identification and antibiotic sensitivity results within a short time. Hence, advancement in the required technology is desirable to improve timing, accuracy and quality. Even with the current advances in methods used for both phenotypic and genotypic identification of bacteria the need is there to develop method(s) that enhance the outcome of bacteriology laboratories in accuracy and time. The hypothesis introduced here {{is based on the}} assumption that the chromosome of any bacteria contains unique sequences that can be used for its identification and typing. The outcome of a pilot study designed to test this hypothesis is reported in this manuscript. Methods: The complete chromosome sequences of several bacterial species were downloaded to use as search targets for unique sequences. Visual basic and SQL server (2014) were used to generate a complete set of 18 -base long primers, a process started with reverse translation of randomly chosen 6 amino acids to limit the number of the generated primers. In addition, the software used to scan the downloaded chromosomes using the generated primers for similarities was designed, and the resulting hits were classified according to the number of similar chromosomal sequences, i. e., unique or otherwise. Results: All primers that had identical/similar sequences in the selected genome sequence(s) were classified according to the number of hits in the chromosomes search. Those that were identical to a single site on a single bacterial chromosome were referred to as unique. On the other <b>hand,</b> most generated <b>primers</b> sequences were identical to multiple sites on a single or multiple chromosomes. Following scanning, the generated primers were classified based on ability to differentiate between medically important bacterial and the initial results looks promising. Conclusion: A simple strategy that started by generating primers was introduced; the primers were used to screen bacterial genomes for match. Primer(s) that were uniquely identical to specific DNA sequence on a specific bacterial chromosome were selected. The identified unique sequence can be used in different molecular diagnostic techniques, possibly to identify bacteria. In addition, a single primer that can identify multiple sites in a single chromosome can be exploited for region or genome identification. Although genomes sequences draft of isolates of organism DNA enable high throughput primer design using alignment strategy, and this enhances diagnostic performance in comparison to traditional molecular assays. In this method the generated primers can be used to identify an organism before the draft sequence is completed. In addition, the generated primers can be used to build a bank for easy access of the primers that can be used to identify bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{earliest}} work on controlled composting {{in the middle}} of the last century, the effectiveness of sanitisation has been determined using pathogen indicator organisms, such as E. coli and conventional enumeration techniques. Recent developments in molecular biology suggested the possibilities of replacing these 'standard' techniques with some form of PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The main part of the study related to the use of PCR to enumerate pathogen indicators in composted organic waste and compared it with conventional cultivation techniques recommended in the compost guidelines (PAS 100). The inactivation of pathogen indicators focus sed on the viability of their DNA and the survival of pathogen indicators in composted material. Membrane filtration was the standard conventional technique used to compare with molecular techniques. The main microorganism used in the study was Salmonella spp. Whilst PCR produced qualitative results' for detecting pathogen indicators, a quantitative approach was 'developed using cPCR (competitive polymerase chain reaction). The deletion method of pathogen-specific competitor fragments production for use in cPCR proved to be effective and was used to develop a competitor fragment. In this study, the cPCR technique was utilised to enumerate Salmonella spp. in aqueous samples. Results indicated that primers that produce a 670 bp fragment from the E. coli gad AB gene did not represent the constructive choice for the cPCR method, because it resulted in PCR amplification products with faint bands and non-specific amplification. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>primers</b> that produced a 284 bp fragment from the invA gene were shown to be effective for the detection of Salmonella spp. by PCR owing to its high specificity. The clear and single band imaged in 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis produced a good match; thus, it was highly significant in the cPCR and PMA-cPCR methods developed. The PMA (propidium monoazide) pretreatment step as DNA-intercalating dye was used in the cPCR protocol to provide viable/dead cell differentiation known as PMA-cPCR. The PMA-cPCR method developed was shown to be effective in enumerating the live Salmonella spp. DNA. The standard cultivation method gave approximately 1 - 2 log 10 cfu/ml less compared to the PMA-cPCR results. These results indicated the existence of the VBNC (viable but non-culturable) state, whereas the viable cells failed to be cultured by the standard cultivation methods. Moreover, it also represented the non-loss of Salmonella spp. DNA during cross-linked upon bright light exposure. The results were approximately of the same magnitude order at average 108 cfu/ml for before and after the photo-activation procedure. The quantification results from the PMA-cPCR method for viable and non-viable DNA were analysed and compared with conventional methods and cPCR. This type of cPCR and PMA-cPCR methodology for quantifying Salmonella spp. shows very positive results, especially when utilised with an aqueous sample. Having developed the PCR based techniques for enumeration of Salmonella spp. work was then carried out in laboratory composters to study the survival of Salmonella spp. However, the DNA-based quantification for compost material was deemed to be an inappropriate method for use with quality monitoring of composting, as it always shows non- specific and non-amplification results. A few drawbacks concerning the use of PCR and PMA-cPCR in compost material were discussed, which led to various suggestions for future research. During the study, it became apparent that several different factors were responsible for the inactivation of Salmonella spp. as well as exposing the organisms to elevated temperatures. Different samples preparations was utilised to differentiate the biological, physical and chemical effects in composted samples. These results confirmed the effects of inactivation mechanisms involved, such as; antagonism and competition from other organisms, effect of chemicals changes and transportation. The PCR is a useful molecular technique for studying pathogen indicator detection and DNA-based quantification in solid waste. When being used it is recommended that highly competent individuals are needed if the nucleic acids amplification protocol is to be used for routine quality monitoring in the composting field. It is recommended that, despite false-positive results that depending on the elements contained in the compost materials, the standard enumeration techniques are the most appropriate for use in composting.

Materials and Methods: 99 permanent bovine incisors were used and divided into nine study groups, three groups for each primer: Group 1, 2 and 3 with Transbond™ MIP; Group 4, 5 and 6 with Transbond™ XT Light Cure Adhesive; Group 7, 8 and 9 with Rely-a-Bond® and every primer was evaluated without contamination, and then contaminated with saliva and water. The measurements of shear strength bond were performed on the universal test machine INSTRON® {{at a rate of}} 0. 5 mm per minute, RAI was evaluated in all samples. Results: The measurement of shear bond strenght in the non contaminated groups was similar to the Transbond™ XT Light Cure Adhesive and Transbond™ MIP primers, but significantly lower for the Rely-a-bond® primer (p< 0. 05). In the contaminated samples, the Transbond™ MIP primer had higher shear {{bond strength}} than the hydrophobic primers. Significant statistically differences were found in all groups (p< 0. 001). RIA was evaluated and {{it was found that the}} majority of groups had results of grade 0 and 1. Conclusions: Water and saliva contamination decreased shear bond strenght using hydrophobic primers.
