5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) {{in relation to}} Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> a high pressure area to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.|$|E

30|$|<b>Kates</b> <b>and</b> Pijawka (1977) divided {{recovery}} processes {{into four}} time periods: an emergency period lasting between {{a few days}} and about 4  weeks; a restoration period lasting from 2 to 9  months, a replacement-reconstruction period lasting from 3 to 20  years, and finally, a phase of developmental reconstruction of undefined length. This model was formulated based on experience gained from the recovery processes in Rapid City, South Dakota (1972 flood), San Francisco, California (1906 earthquake), Anchorage, Alaska (1964 earthquake), and Managua, Nicaragua (1972 earthquake). However, when Hogg (1980) tested the <b>Kates</b> <b>and</b> Pijawka model with the recovery process after the 1976 Venzone earthquake in Friuly, northeast Italy, the first phase took twice as long as the <b>Kates</b> <b>and</b> Pijawka model suggested and the second phase also lasted longer, while the third phase had not been started 3  years later. Hogg eventually concluded that the differences in the time periods were due to the different size and needs of the small town of Venzone following the earthquake, compared with the cities on which the model by <b>Kates</b> <b>and</b> Pijawka was tested.|$|R
5|$|The next day, many {{survivors}} in the island's camp are stressed, including Sullivan (Scott Paulin), who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox). John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{and his new}} hunting companion, Ethan Rom (William Mapother), give some newly found luggage to Hurley; he looks through it and finds golf clubs. The next morning, Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors. Jack, Charlie, and Michael decide to join him, and eventually around twenty people, including <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> Sawyer, arrive to participate.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E

5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, <b>Kate</b> <b>and</b> Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
