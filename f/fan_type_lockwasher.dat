40|$|Although many {{managers}} {{recognize that}} Facebook fans represent a marketing opportunity, {{little is known}} about <b>fan</b> <b>types.</b> This study explores a typology of fans, drawn from a sample of 438 individuals who Like brands on Facebook. Fans brand loyalty, brand love, use of self-expressive brands, and word of mouth (WOM) for Liked brands were used to suggest four fan types: the fan-atic, the utilitarian, the self-expressive and the authentic. Â  The results of this exploratory study highlight the value of cluster analysis as a strategy for identifying different <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> and provide insights to prompt further research into Facebook <b>fan</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

Current events are being developed at local, regional and national level, having economic, commercial, political and socio-cultural implications.

Therefore, marketers {{should be aware of}} sports fans’ needs, discern their motives and predict their buying attitude, estimate the driving forces urging fans to devote time, money and effort to be attend sport events. The scope of the present study is to develop a new sports fan classification scheme, as well as, to evolve a variety of models, like LOGIRE models, aiming at exploring the existence of specific motives, both internal and external that induces fans to attend sports events held abroad.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{investigated}} the unique ventilation requirements of large-opening mines {{to help identify}} and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various <b>fan</b> <b>types</b> to improve the ventilation and air quality in the underground workplace. Large-opening mines, with their low airflow resistance factors, can be ventilated with free-standing auxiliary fans because airflow pat-terns in these mines are primarily controlled by airflow momentum. The flow characteristics of both vane-axial and propeller fans were investigated and tested at four large-opening mines to assess the effects of fan location on recirculation and entrainment. Each <b>fan</b> <b>type</b> has its own airflow, entrainment and penetrating air-flow characteristics, and operating costs that are advantageous for specific applications. Either <b>fan</b> <b>type</b> can be used for most auxiliary applications.
