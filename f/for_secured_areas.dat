50|$|In {{a general}} sense {{non-repudiation}} involves associating actions or changes to a unique individual. <b>For</b> a <b>secure</b> <b>area,</b> <b>for</b> example, it may be desirable to implement a key card access system.

Otherwise determining who performed the action of opening the door cannot be trivially determined. Similarly, for computer accounts, the individual owner of the account must not allow others to use that account, especially, for instance, by giving away their account's password, and a policy should be implemented to enforce this.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have great}} practical importance for surveillance systems to perform monitoring by acquiring and sending information on any intrusion in a <b>secured</b> <b>area.</b> Requirement of very little human intervention {{is one of}} the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a cheaper and safer alternative <b>for</b> <b>securing</b> large <b>areas</b> such as international borders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among the sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming attacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome this problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be able to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the network are known to them. It is also desirable to keep the interactions of the sensor nodes in the network minimal, as they are low powered devices and need to conserve their resources. In this paper we propose a light-weight technique for faster mapping of the jammed regions. We minimize the load on the sensors by removing the actual responsibility of mapping from the network to the central base station (BS). After a few nodes report to the BS, it carries out the task of mapping of the jammed regions in the network. We use our simulation results to compare our proposed system with the existing techniques and also to measure the performance of our system. Our results show that the jammed regions in a network can be mapped from fewer nodes reporting to the base station. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Biometric recognition, {{or simply}} biometrics, {{refers to the}} {{automatic}} recognition of individuals based on their physiological and/or behavioural characteristics. By using biometrics {{it is possible to}} confirm or establish an individual’s identity based on “who she is”, rather than by “what she possesses ” (e. g., an ID card) or “what she remembers ” (e. g., a password). Today, it {{is becoming more and more}} popular to use biometrics to identify people and authenticate them <b>for</b> access to <b>secure</b> <b>areas</b> and systems. This paper will briefly define biometrics and enumerate the various kinds and will examine in more depth vascular biometrics, specifically how vascular biometrics compares with other biometric technologies, how accurate it is, and how it is used to accomplish identity authentication.

Finally, this paper explore how the technology has evolved, and some current and future applications of vascular biometrics in our daily lives, illustrating why vascular biometrics have significant future potential...|$|R

40|$|Models of affective {{behavior}} {{are critical for}} the development of training systems that are designed to exercise social interactions. Potential applications include various security-oriented operations such as police interrogation, airport security, border crossings, and military peacekeeping. Aside from speech, humans also communicate through vocalizations and inflections as well as with body language. Such nonverbal communication can convey affect such as anger or nervousness that is important in identifying deception. In this research, a trainee is asked to perform check point duty and question drivers of vehicles about their identity and reasons <b>for</b> entering a <b>secured</b> <b>area.</b> Most of the encounters are routine and innocuous, but occasionally a scenario unfolds that requires additional interrogation and rapid decision-making the part of the trainee. These special scenarios require the individual to draw upon his/her knowledge of social interactions {{in order to make the}} proper decisions and act appropriately. Virtual environments that address this form of training are few. Accordingly, the present paper describes an ongoing program of research designed to generate affective states for intelligent agents, create affective component behaviors to convey cues for anger, nervousness, and deception, and provide a complex interrogative training environment to exercise judgment-based decision-making. 1. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the many}} {{months leading up}} to {{successful}} detonation of the first atomic bomb, the Trinity test, and delivery of the first airborne atomic weapon, Project Alberta, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director of Los Alamos Laboratory, and his technical advisor, Hartly Rowe, began looking for a new site convenient to Los Alamos for the continuation of weapons development especially its non-nuclear aspects. They felt a separate division would be best to perform these functions. Kirtland had fulfilled Los Alamos' transportation needs for both the Trinity and Alberta projects, thus, Oxnard Field was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps to the U.S. Army Service Forces Chief of Engineer District, and thereafter, assigned to the Manhattan Engineer District. In July 1945, the forerunner of Sandia Laboratory, known as [...] "Z" [...] Division, was established at Oxnard Field to handle future weapons development, testing, and bomb assembly for the Manhattan Engineer District.
