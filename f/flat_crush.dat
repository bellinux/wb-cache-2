40|$|High-resistance {{paper was}} {{manufactured}} by laccase-grafting of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and chitosan (CPX) on Kraft pulp fiber. The reaction was mediated {{in the presence}} of laccase by one of the following polyphenols {{in the presence of}} air: gallic acid (GA), vanillic acid (VA) and catechol (1, 2 –DHB). Enzyme was added at constant loading (24 kg ton− 1), 1 % pulp consistency, 0. 005 % CMC, pH = 6. 3 ± 0. 5 and 2 mM of mediator. CPX content was assessed at two levels (0 % and 0. 005 %). Treated pulps were analyzed by different mechanical tests (ring crush, mullen, corrugating medium test (CMT) <b>flat</b> <b>crush</b> of corrugating medium test and tension). An improvement in these parameters was obtained by biopolymer coupling and selected mediator. When using GA, three parameters increased more than 40 %, while ring crush increased 120 %. For the case of VA, properties were enhanced from 74 % to 88 % when CPX was added. For 1, 2 –DHB, there was not found a statistically significant difference between the results in the presence of CPX. Scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, FTIR and 13 C NMR were used in all papers in order to evaluate grafting. Hence, it was possible to correlate polymerization with an improvement of paper’s mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{researchers}} {{continue to}} study the potential for lithium and lithium-ion battery thermal runaway from an internal short circuit in equipment for use in underground coal mines. Researchers conducted cell crush tests using a plastic wedge within a 20 -L explosion-containment chamber filled with 6. 5 % CH 4 -air to simulate the mining hazard. The present work extends earlier findings to include a study of LiFePO 4 cells crushed while under charge, prismatic form factor LiCoO 2 cells, primary spiral-wound constructed LiMnO 2 cells, and crush speed influence on thermal runaway susceptibility. The plastic wedge crush was a more severe test than the <b>flat</b> plate <b>crush</b> with a prismatic format cell. Test results indicate that prismatic Saft MP 174565 LiCoO 2 and primary spiral-wound Saft FRIWO M 52 EX LiMnO 2 cells pose a CH 4 -air ignition hazard from internal short circuit. Under specified test conditions, A 123 systems ANR 26650 M 1 A LiFePO 4 cylindrical cells produced no chamber ignitions while under a charge of up to 5 A. Common spiral-wound cell separators {{are too thin to}} meet intrinsic safety standards provisions for distance through solid insulation, suggesting that a hard internal short circuit within these cells should be considered for intrinsic safety evaluation purposes, even as a non-countable fault. Observed flames from a LiMnO 2 spiral-wound cell after a chamber ignition within an inert atmosphere indicate a sustained exothermic reaction within the cell. The influence of crush speed on ignitions under specified test conditions was not statistically significant.

40|$|To {{test the}} Blade Runners concept for {{reducing}} ice induced vibration and loads on structures a simple configuration {{consisting of a}} single stationary blade on a rigid <b>flat</b> metal <b>crushing</b> plate was chosen for ice crushing tests in NRC/OCRE 2 ̆ 019 s Large Cold Room facility. Five wedge-shaped columnar-grained freshwater ice samples were crushed against a thick plate with a low-profile blade on it {{and the results were}} compared with those from another five crushing experiments using a plate without a blade. The two crushing plates were made of aluminum and had identical characteristics other than that one of them had a blade on it. The blade had an isosceles right triangular section profile with a height of 1 mm and base of 2 mm. The blade spanned the length of the plate and was centered relative to the wedge-shaped ice samples and parallel with their long axes. Tests were conducted at - 10 oC and the nominal crushing plate displacement rate was 10 mm/s. High-speed imaging was used to observe the ice contact zone, by viewing through the ice samples, as it evolved and moved around somewhat during the tests. Load records from the tests using the bladeless crushing plate exhibited a high-amplitude sawtooth load pattern, resulting from fairly regular ice spalling events, that is typical of ice crushing in the brittle regime. This type of spalling behaviour, and associated sawtooth load pattern, is responsible for ice induced vibration of structures when ice sheets encroach on them. The average loads were roughly the same during either set of tests. However for those tests where the plate with the blade on it was used it was observed that when the blade was in the hard zone region of the ice contact area the load pattern was dramatically affected. In those cases the blade effectively smoothed the sawtooth loading pattern by greatly increasing the spalling rate and reducing the spall size. Consequently the amplitudes of the load sawteeth were significantly reducedPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a <b>flat</b> bed of <b>crushed</b> stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down.

The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|R
