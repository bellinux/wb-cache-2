The two formed Reginald Denny Industries in 1935 {{to develop a}} new radio controlled model, and were joined by <b>electronics</b> <b>engineer</b> Kenneth Case. For the next three years they attempted to produce a design known as the Radioplane One, or RP-1, essentially a greatly enlarged model airplane, complete with a fuselage area that included the step where a windscreen was in a real aircraft. The control system was based on a telephone dial: dial 4 for elevator down, and then 2 to stop the motion. Due to the latencies in the system, the aircraft were found to be almost uncontrollable.|$|E
25|$|ABS-CBN Corporation, {{commonly}} known as ABS-CBN, is a Filipino media and entertainment group based in Quezon City. It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System and Chronicle Broadcasting Network. It was founded in 1946 by Jewish American <b>electronics</b> <b>engineer</b> James Lindenberg and Judge Antonio Quirino (the brother of the sixth Philippine President Elpidio Quirino) as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS). Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN), on the other hand, was founded in 1952 by newspaper mogul Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez (the Philippine Vice President for three terms from 1949 to 1953 and 1965 to 1973). The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967, and renamed as ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN was first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.|$|E

500|$|Deacon's first bass, {{used in the}} Opposition was an Eko, later {{switching}} to a Rickenbacker 4001. For most of Queen's career, he used a Fender Precision Bass, which underwent a number of cosmetic changes. Towards {{the end of the}} group's career, he used a custom bass designed by Roger Giffin. He also used an Ernie Ball MusicMan Stingray live on occasion. As a trained <b>electronics</b> <b>engineer,</b> he was able to build equipment for the band. His most famous creation is the [...] "Deacy Amp", built in 1972 from pieces of electronic equipment found in a skip, and used by himself and May throughout Queen's recording career. Many of the so-called [...] "guitar orchestras" [...] on Queen albums use this amplifier.|$|E
500|$|Redding and Mitchell {{were not}} {{included}} in the process because Chandler felt that it was more efficient for him and Hendrix to do it alone. To get a better quality recording, Chandler took the four-track tape recorded at De Lane Lea to Olympic Studios for overdubbing (although Hendrix had worked with eight-track recording in the US, it was not yet available in the UK). At Olympic, they were assigned Eddie Kramer, who, as a sound engineer, played an important role in subsequent Hendrix recordings. Hendrix added new vocals and guitar parts between February 3 and 8, 1967. [...] Unlike the conventional techniques used by the Experience to record previous songs, Chandler decided to try out new effects and sounds for [...] "Purple Haze". He enhanced background sounds (some contributed by Redding) by playing them back through headphones, which were moved around the recording microphone, creating [...] "a weird echo". Chandler also used sped-up guitar parts recorded at half-speed (which also raises the pitch) and panning to create novel effects. The guitar solo features the first use of the Octavia guitar effects unit. [...] Acoustical and <b>electronics</b> <b>engineer</b> Roger Mayer developed the unit with input from Hendrix. The Octavia doubles the frequency of the sound it is fed, essentially adding an upper octave.|$|E
500|$|In 1951, {{while working}} for {{military}} contractor Loral <b>Electronics,</b> <b>engineer</b> Ralph H. Baer was assigned to build a television set; while doing so, Baer claims he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control, rather than only hooking {{it up to a}} remote television station. Baer did not pursue the idea, but it returned to him in August 1966 while waiting for a bus. Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a US$20 [...] "game box" [...] that would plug into a television screen and play games on it. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point, the very first electronic computer games had been developed {{at the start of the}} 1950s, and by 1966 several early mainframe games had been developed for mainframe computers, which were typically only found in large academic or research institutions. In the proposal, Baer began by referring to the project using military terminology, but by the time he finished it he was referring to it as Channel LP, short for [...] "let's play". The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into as if it were a television channel, and Baer described several games that could be played on it.|$|E
