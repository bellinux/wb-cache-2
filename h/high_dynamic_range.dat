5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without some key features such as <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is {{also one}} of the first games that uses the Havok's HydraCore physics engine, which was {{specifically}} designed for multi-core video game systems such as the Xbox 360. The game's renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the previous console generation, including parallax mapping, ambient occlusion, subsurface scattering, and <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> The soundtrack of the game was primarily composed by David Clynick, who worked with Grant Kirkhope on the original Nintendo 64 game's score. New York based group MorissonPoe contributed two songs to the score, while DJs Kepi and Kat composed the game's nightclub theme.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Daredevil was {{released}} on March 18, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K. Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site. The images were randomly distributed among select subscribers, with Netflix tracking to see which one was the best-performing to eventually use for all subscribers. Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how long it was until the season would debut. The season was enhanced to be available in <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of capturing <b>higher</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> video with a mobile device. We assume the mobile device has a standard (or low) <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image sensor, and that the device is constrained by power and processing capability. To address these issues, we develop a system that captures a video sequence containing time varying exposure settings, encodes this sequence without modification, and then transmits the sequence to a decoder. The bit-stream is constructed so that legacy decoding devices only decode a single exposure setting while advanced devices decode multiple exposure settings and then use the decoded data to reconstruct a <b>higher</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image sequence.

5|$|Following release, {{some players}} {{reported}} getting motion sickness due {{a combination of}} the narrow field of view used by the game and the bobbing of the player's viewpoint simulating motions during walking. Blow stated they are working on a patch to allow players to adjust their field of view, disable the head bobbing, and enable faster movement options. In August 2016, the Microsoft Windows version was updated to provide support for Nvidia's Ansel extension, which allows players to compose shots to be rendered in ultra-high resolutions or for 3D and virtual reality devices. Following Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Blow affirmed they will patch the game for that console to support 4k resolutions without sacrificing framerate. Blow is also working to support devices with <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> (HDR) for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro versions.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E

50|$|Digital audio with undithered 20-bit {{digitization}} is theoretically {{capable of}} 120 dB <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> 24-bit digital audio calculates to 144 dB <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> Most Digital audio workstations process audio with 32-bit floating-point representation which affords even <b>higher</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> and so loss of <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> {{is no longer}} a concern in terms of digital audio processing.

25|$|The {{images on}} the right show the {{interior}} of a church, a scene which has a variation in radiance much larger than that which can be displayed on a monitor or recorded by a conventional camera. The six individual exposures from the camera show the radiance of the scene in some range transformed to the range of brightnesses that can be displayed on a monitor. The range of radiances recorded in each photo is limited, so not all details can be displayed at once: for example, details of the dark church interior cannot be displayed {{at the same time as}} those of the bright stained-glass window. An algorithm is applied to the six images to recreate the <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> radiance map of the original scene (a <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image). Alternatively, some higher-end consumer and specialist scientific digital cameras are able to record a <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> image directly, for example with RAW images.|$|E

25|$|An {{even more}} {{sophisticated}} group of tone mapping algorithms {{is based on}} contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated {{by the fact that}} the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: gradient domain <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of <b>High</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Range</b> Images (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).|$|E
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} market of {{industrial}} and automotive vision systems demands for image sensors with very <b>high</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> of more than 100 dB. State of the art linear imagers are not capable of delivering this signal range at standard video speeds while sensors with logarithmic signal compression suffer from high fixed pattern noise, low contrast and excessive temperature drift.
