In the wider context it aims to contribute to the analyses of human progress traced through the history of our technologies and inventions. These breakthroughs do not happen or spread without beneficial influences from societal institutions in spheres like culture, philosophy, politics and law. Language is the creator and carrier of these institutions. A complicated “ecosystem” of culture, science, financing, laws and regulations, affects the possibilities for economic growth through innovation. Perhaps due to the contested legitimacy of corporations in the democratic process, the study of the messages of corporate entities in the political arena seems to be a fairly unexplored dimension of traditional rhetorical analysis of politics. Through rhetorical criticism the author seeks to better understand Google’s communication in this area, and to gain further insights into the communication strategies that companies may use to influence such complex fields of politics as Innovation Policy...|$|E

A survey was done on students from this institution to obtain their perception on the subject matter through a set of questionnaires adopted from similar study done elsewhere. A comparison of the responses from those that have directly engagement with innovation, invention and design project (IID group) and those without any direction engagement with innovation, invention and design project (non-IID group) was carried out. Students who participated in the <b>innovation</b> <b>convention</b> related themselves to be more confident and motivated in their study as compared to students who have not participated in any innovation, invention and design project. Their engagement in the project helps them in the teamwork and their communication skills. Their thinking is more influenced by their lecturers than by their friends. This finding is opposite to that of the students who did not participate in the project. Hence, the effort, time and money spent on engaging students with activities related to IID are worthwhile endeavour that steered towards producing competent graduates...|$|E

40|$|Lesbian and gay parented {{families}} are often viewed {{through the lens}} of 'families of choice', which assumes they are self-reflexive and innovative in structure. In recent years, some lesbians and gay men have informally negotiated reproductive relationships with friends or acquaintances. The varied kinship assumptions underpinning such relationships are the focus of this article. Three main approaches to family formation are identified: 'standard donor', 'social solidarity' and 'co-parenting'. I argue that a continuum of kinship intentions is evident in these different approaches, and that the degree of <b>innovation</b> and <b>convention</b> needs to be unpacked, particularly with regard to the status of friendship as kinship. I comment on the persistent appeal of co-habiting coupledom as the basis for parenting and the perceived asymmetry between biological motherhood and fatherhood. In conceptualizing and negotiating reproductive relationships, lesbians and gay men may accept or reconfigure the assumptions characteristic of heteronormative clinical assisted reproductive technology (ART) conventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} service {{industry}} {{is closely related}} to the economic development. Valuable service can strengthen the competitiveness of the enterprises and improve the quality of live. Recently the manufacturing industries start to embrace the service concept by integrating intangible service with the tangible products. On the other hand, to increase service quality and customers’ satisfaction, service industries need to meet the consumers’ demand by utilizing the newly developed technology. Recently Taiwan has held many international large-scale exhibitions which are highly value-added service activities and can be extended to the tourism industry. The convention and exhibition industry can boost service economy. However, the capacity, quality, the level of innovation are still very difficult to be measured. In this study, we try to adopt the methodology of industrial engineering and system management and other newly developed methods of service science to present a systematic <b>innovation</b> for the <b>convention</b> and exhibition industry. First, service blueprint was used to describe the service delivery process of the convention and exhibition industry. Then we prescribed the service construct by conducting literature review and survey from the practitioners’ viewpoints. We also applied demand correlation matrix which integrates with TRIZ to obtain the innovation principles that facilitate service innovation could be systematically developed for the designated customers. Further, we used World Expo as a case study to illustrate the process of systematic innovation. Finally, we found that the new dimension of service innovation can be obtained by using the proposed method integrating QFD and TRIZ. The main contribution {{of this study is to}} provide a reference model of systematic <b>innovation</b> for <b>convention</b> and exhibition industry. Such methodology can also be applied to the other related service sectors...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reflects}} upon UNHCR's Convention Plus initiative, a multi-lateral process {{established in}} order {{to contribute to the}} development of a normative framework for global burden-sharing. Although the substantive achievements of the initiative have been limited, the article argues that Convention Plus has helped to develop significant new ideas relating to UNHCR's potential role in norm-creation within the refugee regime. Based on a regime theoretical perspective, and drawing on the wider literature relating to the role of norms in the refugee regime, the paper examines the procedural and conceptual <b>innovations</b> of <b>Convention</b> Plus, and how these might be adapted in future in light of the initiative's shortcomings. In particular, the article sets out two models for UNHCR's role in facilitating norm-creation, both developed in the context of the Convention Plus experience: firstly, a 'top-down' institutional bargaining model and, secondly, a 'bottom-up' good practice model. The former model emerges from the interests-linkages-norms approach implicit to the so-called 'generic' work of the initiative; the latter, from the situational work of the initiative, developed through the revival of 'comprehensive plans of action' and the use of pilot projects. The models are argued to be mutually supportive. The paper suggests that adapting these ideal-type models in light of the Convention Plus experience has implications for UNHCR's role in norm-creation, with regard both to developing a normative framework for global burden-sharing and also to developing other norms in response to other emerging challenges. © The Author [2007].

In it, I argue that British periodicals undertook a project to theorize, narrativize, and regulate the deceptively simple concept of a living author. Periodicals confronted the inadequacy of their critical methods in dealing with the living and came to define the “living author” as a disturbing model for the everyday person—an encouragement to self-display and a burden on public attention. Through their engagement with this disruptive figure, periodical writers eventually found in it a potential model for their own contingent, anonymous work, and embraced the self-actualizing possibilities that this reviled figure unexpectedly offered. My chapters survey crises and scandals in the periodical sphere; from the famous attacks on John Keats and Leigh Hunt, to the dismissal of female novelists like Fanny Burney, to the uproar over the political apostasies of William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey. Through a critical look at the book-reviewing project and other responses to living authors, I argue that the Romantic periodical invented living authorship as practice rather than ontology, emphasizing the importance of body, habit, and iterative performance to its significance. ...|$|R

40|$|The eight {{novels that}} {{are the focus of}} this study exhibit {{combinations}} of style, form, and content characterized here as a poetics of flirtation. In terms of Lacanian theory, the authors of these novels employ modes of representation that disrupt traditions of the masculine symbolic and suggest alternative modes more consistent with feminine-constructed identity. Marilynne Robinson 2 ̆ 7 s Housekeeping introduces the characteristics of a flirtatious text: prose defamiliarized by the rhythms and syntax of poetry and eroticized by the interplay of opposites and elision of categorical boundaries; sensuous imagery that exploits ambiguity and invokes fecundity; fractured chronology intensified in effect by metaphors of movement and fluidity; formal <b>innovations</b> critiquing textual <b>conventions</b> and echoed in devices of plot and character that connect conventions with patriarchal control of/through language and female resistance with alternate means of expression. Zelda Fitzgerald 2 ̆ 7 s Save Me the Waltz (1932) and Virginia Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s The Years (1937) demonstrate the purposeful challenge that a break with traditions of the masculine symbolic represents and introduce intrusions of newly accessed, disturbingly illusive realms of signification. Djuna Barnes in Nightwood (1936) and Jamaica Kincaid in The Autobiography of My Mother (1996) toy with the deconstructive power of these textual practices, pushing them to a point where the reader confronts their dangers and evaluates their risks. Arundhati Roy 2 ̆ 7 s The God of Small Things (1997) and Ntozake Shange 2 ̆ 7 s Liliane: Resurrection of the Daughter (1994) examine, conversely, the potential annihilation attached to avoiding such risk and promote the creation of new vocabularies appropriate to necessary deconstructions. In Art and Lies: A Piece for Three Voices and a Bawd, Jeanette Winterson demonstrates the political dimension of textual flirtation by focusing its deconstructive power on social as well as textual practices. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{backdrop}} {{to the scene}} is a minimally elaborated mountainous background. Michelangelo did not render this background in great detail. Vasari states, “There are no landscapes {{to be seen in}} these scenes, nor any trees, buildings or other embellishments and variation.” The mountains are painted in a faint blue hue, which perhaps is intended to increase the depth of field through atmospheric perspective. The land represented in the middle ground and foreground is a pale yellow-green that is in some places more of a yellow ochre in color. The only real vertical elements in the painting are the figures, which occupy most of the foreground. Many clusters of people surround a single large central figure that is mounted on a crucifix. The most impressive formal attribute of this painting (besides its considerable size) is its central compositional element. Unlike the many prior representations of the martyrdom of Peter, this one depicts the raising of the cross- the moment before the crucifixion has truly begun. The angle of the crucifix activates the composition and creates much more dynamism in what might otherwise be a static image. The strong diagonal creates a cyclical visual pattern for the eyes to follow. If one reads the painting from left to right, the figures ascending the steps on the bottom left lead the eye upward towards a cluster of equestrian figures. They direct the eye to the group of people located on the top right corner, which in turn lead to one end of the crucifix. The other end of the crucifix points again to the men who are climbing up the steps. Michelangelo also created many strong diagonals with the placement of his figures and the extension of their arms and legs towards a central point of convergence. The position of St Peter's body in this work is often noted as Michelangelo's most interesting <b>innovation.</b> He defied <b>convention</b> by placing Peter’s upper body so that he needs to crane upward and twist his neck to make eye contact with the viewer's gaze. This {{is a far cry from}} the painted visages of the final moments of countless martyrs, which is typically a passive uplifted gaze. The saint’s penetrating stare suggests that he demands the witness of his audience; he demands their focus and gaze, and beseeches that his sacrifice not be deemed in vain.|$|R
