5|$|The Ulster County Department of Social Services {{received}} {{reports from}} neighbors and physicians of Tina Santosky regarding her injuries: a broken femur, bruises, and cuts. Suspecting child abuse, Bernhardt S. Kramer, the Commissioner of the Ulster County Department of Social Services initiated parental neglect proceedings and removed Tina Santosky from {{the custody of}} her parents, John and Annie Santosky, in November 1973. 10 months later, the Santoskys' second child, John II, was removed after he {{was found to be}} suffering from malnutrition. On that same day, Annie Santosky gave birth to Jed, the couple's third child. Three days after Jed's birth, he was removed from their custody and placed in a <b>foster</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the contact between <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and social workers, by doing a comparison of the social workers and the <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> experiences of the cooperation that is between them. We started from three main questions to get an answer to our aim, how the <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and the social workers experience the organization of the foster care in the Social Service as an impact of the cooperation, what does the <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and the social workers experience as a important fact of a successful placement and finally, how does the <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and the social workers experience the supporting and controlling contact that is between them. To get our results we based our study on interviews whit four <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and whit four social workers. The analysis was based on one theoretical perspective, Skaus (2007) analytical approach for power and help. As a conclusion we have found out, that the organization of the Social Service has significance for the contact between social workers and <b>foster</b> <b>homes.</b> The social workers and the <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> have different opinions of how the Social Service should be organized, so that the contact should be as good as possible. The social workers saw the ground work as an important fact for the placement to be successful. Both social workers and <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> saw the confidence between them, as an important fact for the placement to be successful. All four <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and two of the social workers saw the controlling part of the contact as a good and necessary thing. The other two of the social workers saw the controlling part as a complicated assignment.   The social workers saw the controlling part as an inadequate thing in the foster care today. Both <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> and social workers experience that the supporting contact between them are working well...|$|R

40|$|Child {{characteristics}} {{which include}} {{age at the}} time of entry into the foster care system, reason for removal, and ethnicity are examined among children in the foster care system residing in kinship and foster placements. Children of all ages are found to have higher rates of placement in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> than in kinship homes or any other type of placement. Infants are most often placed in foster homes; they are placed in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> three times more often than with kin. Children who were removed from their parents for neglect are more often placed with kin than in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> or other placement types as are children removed for ???other??? reasons. Children removed from their parents for physical or sexual abuse make up {{a small portion of the}} sample; both groups are found to be placed more frequently in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> than with kin. Finally, children with an ethnic background other than white are more often placed with kin than in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> or other placement types. Children who identified as white are more often placed in <b>foster</b> <b>homes</b> than with kin or in other types of placement...|$|R
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E
25|$|Children {{found to}} be unable to {{function}} in a <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> may be placed in Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) or other such group homes. In theory, the focus of treatment in such facilities is to prepare the child {{for a return to}} a <b>foster</b> <b>home,</b> to an adoptive home, or to the birth parents when applicable. But two major reviews of the scholarly literature have questioned these facilities' effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Because of Genie's {{previous}} treatment Miner and David Rigler {{arranged for}} her to stay at Children's Hospital for two weeks, where her condition moderately improved. Authorities then placed Genie in another <b>foster</b> <b>home,</b> where she did fairly well, but in mid-December 1977 the arrangement very suddenly ended. Through {{the end of that}} month into early January Genie lived in a temporary setting, after which authorities put her in another <b>foster</b> <b>home.</b> During this time Curtiss wrote to Miner that Genie did not understand the reasons she was moving and believed it was her fault for not being a good enough person, and said the frequency with which her living arrangements changed further traumatized her and caused continued developmental regression.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, an ex-foster {{child was}} awarded $30 million by jury trial in California (Santa Clara County) for sexual abuse damages that {{happened}} to him in his <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> from 1995 to 1999. The foster parent, John Jackson, was licensed by the state, {{despite the fact that}} he abused his own wife and son, overdosed on drugs and was arrested for drunken driving. In 2006, Jackson was convicted in Santa Clara County of nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child by force, violence, duress, menace and fear, and seven counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child under 14, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office. The sex acts that he forced the children in his foster care to perform sent him to prison for 220 years. Later in 2010, Giarretto Institute, the private foster family agency responsible for licensing and monitoring Jackson's <b>foster</b> <b>home</b> and others, was also found to be negligent and liable for 75 percent of the abuse that was inflicted on the victim, and Jackson himself was liable for the rest.|$|E
