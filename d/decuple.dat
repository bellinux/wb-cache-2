This can be explained that both of them can avoid collisions by energy sensing. Meanwhile, the EGRSA obtains a stable gain about 2 – 3 % than sensing algorithm because it can solve the problem of hidden node according to the analysis in Section 3. It means that the VUE which uses EGRSA is more likely to decode a data packet successfully. The gain between EGRSA and sensing algorithm can be amplified further if the detecting precision of sensing algorithm decreases. In our simulation, detecting precision is <b>decuple</b> than noise.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the income distributional {{effects of the}} common agricultural policy (CAP) for farmers and landowners. First, we theoretically analyse the level of farmers' and landowners' gains from coupled and decoupled payments. Second, using a unique farm level panel data set from the FADN for the period 1995 - 2007 we employ the fixed effects, the Heckman selection bias and the GMM estimators to estimate income distributional effects of CAP subsidies. The results do not confirm the theoretical hypothesis that landowners benefit {{a large share of}} the CAP subsidies. According to our estimates, farmers gain between 60 % to 95 %, 80 % to 178 % and 86 % to 90 % of the total value of coupled crop/animal, coupled RDP and <b>decupled</b> payments, respectively. The CAP subsidies are only marginally capitalised in land rents. Our results suggest that rental rates are more responsive to structural variables and show a strong time dependency, suggesting the presence of rigidities in the EU rental markets, which constraint the adjustment of land rents to market signals and thus reduce landowners' gains from the CAP.

40|$|Workflow is {{the most}} popular choice among {{businesses}} for capturing and managing their operational knowledge. The authors propose an extension to traditional workflow that enables Web services to be composed into business solutions. From a business perspective, Web services represent a new channel for the offer as well as the acquisition of business capabilities. 3 The full automation of the interaction process between providers and consumers is a peculiarity of the Web service channel. Beyond electronic data transfer, automation extends to all aspects of business interaction. 2 The negotiation of terms and conditions for service delivery and the management of service-level agreements are just some examples. Since their early definition, composition has been a central concept for Web services. 12 In the Web service model, the provider of a new Web service WS drives the composition of internal and external capabilities in order to produce a new capability. Both internal and external capabilities are modelled as Web services that act as components for WS. Similarly, WS can be used as component for other Web services. The fact that a capability is available internally or needs to be acquired externally reflects on the business as well as technical design of the service. The Web service model enforces the separation between a service component and the related service provider. Different providers can be selected for the same capability under different circumstances. From a business as well as a technology perspective, Web services enable dynamic integration for service providers. The explicit management of the interaction processes associated to the delivery of a service is a fundamental aspect of Web services. INTERACTION PROCESSES The <b>decupling</b> of service logic and service provider is closely related to the most noticeable feature of the Web service model: processoriented interfaces. In traditional component models, function signatures often represent the only information on the interaction requirements of a component. While the invocation of a function can trigger complex interaction processes, interaction logic is not formally exposed. In the Web service model, the interaction processes associated to a Web service are explicitly formalized and exposed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years there is growing debate between {{agricultural}} economists {{on the role of}} agriculture to product positive ad negative externalities. The externalities are defined as pubblic goods or no-commodity outputs (Marangon, 2006; Daugstad et al., 2006; OECD, 2001; Brunori et al., 2006) and they need of specific regulation. In rural areas landscape is a typical example of externality because it is the result of agricultural activity and it changes with the agricultural change. At same time, landscape in specific territorial contexts can assume historic, cultural, social and economic value, so that it could become a strategic resource for local development politics (Brunori et al, 2006). The <b>decupling</b> and cross-compliance introduced by the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the increasing demand of environmental goods by citizen/consumers are elements of novelty that will modify farms in next years. In particular, CAP reform could lead to farm externalisation of activity or suspension of business in many rural areas with important socio-economic and environmental impacts as, for example, on landscape. In Val d’Orcia, as in other Tuscany rural areas, landscape assumes the role of economic resource because it attracts tourists and is utilised to promote the territory (landscape as a “business card”). This is in connection with the rural configuration of the landscape and the high concentration of architectonic and artistic goods. To remember, for example, the UNESCO recognition in 2004 as “Val d’Orcia cultural landscape”. At same time, if this landscape is an important points of strength of the local economy, it shows also environmental fragility (biodiversity reduction, soli erosion, etc.) that they need specific actions. In agreement with art. 1 of European Landscape Convention (European Council, 2000) where is affirmed that “Landscape means an area, as perceived by people, whose character {{is the result of the}} action and interaction of natural and/or human factors”, this work shows the results of a survey developed in Val d’Orcia with this objectives: •	to identify the driving forces that have leaded to the current landscape in Val d’Orcia to start to 1970 th; •	to try to define the possible landscape evolution in relationship with the novelty introduced by the CAP reform; •	to suggest specific actions to drive the landscape evolution in the direction of a “sustainable rural landscape” where landscape is an element to strengthen the identity of local rural community, to promote local sustainable development and to safeguard environmental resources in their complex (European Council, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} new {{empirical evidence}} on delinking / Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKC) for greenhouse gases and other air pollutant emissions in Italy. A panel dataset {{based on the}} Italian NAMEA (National Accounts Matrix including Environmental Accounts) for 1990 - 2005 is analyzed with a specific focus on industry, for which we may integrate the emission-income NAMEA matrix with data on trade openness and R&D expenditures. The highly disaggregated dataset provides a large heterogeneity and can help to overcome the shortcomings of the usual approach to EKC based on cross-country data. The empirical originality is relying on the very rich NAMEA sector based economic-environmental merged dataset over 1990 - 2005 merged with data on trade openness (1995 - 2004) for EU and extra EU dimensions, and finally R&D sector data (1991 - 2003). The quite long dynamics and the high sector heterogeneity allow robust inference on various hypotheses related to the ‘driving forces’ of delinking trends. We use in this paper CO 2, SOx, NOx and PM 10 as object of investigation. We mainly test, {{in addition to the}} core evidence on the EKC shape of CO 2, the following hypotheses: (a) whether the increasing trends associated to trade openness with EU and non EU countries affect emission dynamics, following the ‘pollution haven’ debate; (b) whether pre Kyoto and post Kyoto dynamics show different empirical structures; (c) whether sector R&D plays a role in explaining emission efficiency. We use as empirical models of reference both a standard EKC model witnessing emissions on employees as measure of environmental technical efficiency, and a STIRPAT/IPAT model, which shows as dependant variable emissions, and relaxes the assumption of unitary elasticity with respect to labour (population), which enters as a driver. The policy relevance of the work relies (1) around the temporal structural break on pre-Kyoto and post Kyoto dynamics and (2) the possibility of investigating inside the branch dinamics that could help to shape EU policies such as refinements to existing Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), or a new carbon tax for specific sectors. Our results show that looking at sector evidence, both <b>decupling</b> and then eventually re-coupling trends could emerge along the path of economic development. The analysis of how stagnation periods affect environmental performances is also of interest. Specifically, results are summarised as follows. CO 2 still seems to be associated to only relative delinking, with some signs of even re-coupling threats. In addition, it seems that in the post Kyoto phase CO 2 emissions have even increased, with a significant structural break, and to some extent counter intuitively given that Italy has suffered a stagnation around 2002 - 2005. Shifts towards coal power and decrease in environmental technology dynamics may be two explanations. Instead, all other emissions show 1997 as a turning point towards lower structural emissions. Counter intuitively, but this may be dye to lower marginal costs of abatement and impure public good reasoning, non GHG externalities have benefited from Kyoto more than CO 2. Trade expansion validates the pollution haven in some cases, but also show negative signs when EU trade only is considered: this may due to technology spillovers and positive ‘race to the top’, not to the bottom, regarding EU trade partners (Italy and Germany as main exporters and also trade partner in the EU). Finally, R&D show weak correlation to emissions efficiency, apart from SOx trends. This may be due to some endogeneity (R&D explains value added in a co-evolutionary way) and confirms the need of increasing research and efforts in producing specific data on ‘environmental innovations’...|$|R

A wide range of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders associated with high doses of neonicotinoids administered to animals have also been reported. Consequently, we used a mouse model to investigate the response of the central nervous system to ACE treatment. Our results show that exposure to ACE-containing water for three or seven days (<b>decuple</b> and centuple of no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) /day) caused a decrease in body weight in 10 -week old A/JJmsSlc (A/J) mice. However, the treatments did not affect brain histology or expression of CD 34. ACE concentrations were significantly higher in the midbrain of ACE-treated mice than that of the normal and vehicle groups. Expression levels of α 7, α 4, and β 2 nAChRs were found to be low in the olfactory bulb and midbrain of normal mice. Furthermore, in the experimental group (centuple ACE-containing water for seven days), β 2 nAChR expression decreased in many brain regions. Information regarding the amount of accumulated ACE and expression levels of the acetylcholine receptor in each region of the brain is important for understanding any clinical symptoms that may be associated with ACE exposure...|$|E
