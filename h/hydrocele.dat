5|$|After the marriage, Ramanujan {{developed}} a <b>hydrocele</b> testis. The condition could {{be treated with}} a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family {{did not have the}} money for the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.|$|E
25|$|The jockstrap {{was also}} {{influential}} in early 20th-century medicine with {{the invention of}} the Heidelberg Electric Belt, a low-voltage electric powered jockstrap that claimed to cure kidney disorders, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, and other ailments. Today, jockstraps are still worn mostly by adolescent and adult men for sports, weightlifting, medical purposes and for recovery from injury or surgery for such conditions as hematocele, groin hernia, <b>hydrocele,</b> or spermatocele.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using percutaneous embolization). Possible complications {{of this procedure}} include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), <b>hydrocele</b> (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), infection, or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur, resulting {{in a loss of}} a testicle.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable Japanese surgeon of the Edo period, Hanaoka was famous for {{combining}} Dutch and Japanese surgery and introducing modern surgical techniques to Japan. Hanaoka successfully operated for <b>hydrocele,</b> anal fistula, and even performed certain kinds of plastic surgery. He was the first surgeon {{in the world who}} used the general anaesthesia in surgery and who dared to operate on cancers of the breast and oropharynx, to remove necrotic bone, and to perform amputations of the extremities in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Gomoiu {{published}} steadily, {{and also}} lectured at the Medical Students' Society and the Surgical Society. Topics included meningoencephalitis, cerebral atrophy, facial nerve paralysis, fibrous tissue neoplasm, lipoma, {{the anatomy of}} the endothelium, corneal transplantation, skin grafting, dental implants, hysterectomy, various types of cysts and [...] "rare tumors", and talus bone expulsion. These works were taken up in Eraclie Sterian's magazine, Spitalul, of which Gomoiu was co-editor, or published as brochures. His doctoral thesis, on facial anaplasia, was awarded a magna cum laude in 1909, and published the same year. It was followed in 1910 by Gomoiu's introduction to inguinal hernia surgery, his reviews of surgery as applied to genital tuberculosis, vaginal <b>hydrocele,</b> urethrocele, and varicocele, and a work on the physiological role of cholesterol. A winner of the Manoah Hillel scholarship, that year and the next also saw his first contributions as a medical bibliographer and librarian, with catalogues of entries for the Bucharest University graduation papers in medicine. For his service in the Romanian Army, Gomoiu was concentrated in Medgidia.|$|E

60|$|We thus {{see that}} in many, {{probably}} in all cases, the secondary characters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex, ready to be evolved under peculiar circumstances. We can thus understand how, for instance, {{it is possible for}} a good milking cow to transmit her good qualities through her male offspring to future generations; for we may confidently believe that these qualities are present, though latent, in the males of each generation. So it is with the game-cock, who can transmit his superiority in courage and vigour through his female to his male offspring; and with man it is known (13/59. Sir H. Holland 'Medical Notes and Reflections' 3rd edition 1855 page 31.) that diseases, such as <b>hydrocele,</b> necessarily confined to the male sex, can be transmitted through the female to the grandson. Such cases as these offer, as was remarked at the commencement of this chapter, the simplest possible examples of reversion; and they are intelligible on the belief that characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of the same sex are present, though latent, in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex.|$|E
6000|$|This {{part of the}} {{negotiations}} ended with presenting some [...] "satin stripe" [...] and rum to the Nchinu and Manbuku Prata, and with shaking hands--a dangerous operation. The people are cleanly; they wash when rising, and before as well as after every meal; they are always bathing, yet from prince to pauper, from baby to grey beard, they are affected with a psora known by its Portuguese name, [...] "sarnas." [...] The Congo [...] "fiddle" [...] appears first between the articulations of the fingers, and bleaches the hands and wrists {{as if it were}} leprosy. Yet I did not see a single case of true lepra Arabum, or its modifications, the huge Barbadoes leg (elephantiasis), and the sarcoma scrotale and sarcocele of Zanzibar and East Africa. From the extremities the gale extends over the body, especially the shins, and the people, who appear in the perpetual practice of scalpturigo, attribute it to the immoderate use of palm wine. I observed, however, that Europeans, in the river, who avoid the liquor, are hardly ever free from this foul blood-poison, and a jar of sulphur mixture is a common article upon the table. <b>Hydrocele</b> is not unfrequent, but hardly so general as in the Eastern Island; one manner of white man, a half caste from Mac√°o, was suffering with serpigo, and boasted of it.|$|E

Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or ductus deferens. The edge of the <b>hydrocele</b> sac is oversewn for hemostasis (von Bergmann's technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). <b>Hydrocele</b> surgery with excision of the <b>hydrocele</b> sac is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hydrocele</b> Surgery with Plication of the <b>Hydrocele</b> Sac: The <b>hydrocele</b> {{is opened}} with a small skin {{incision}} without further preparation. The <b>hydrocele</b> sac is reduced (plicated) by suture <b>Hydrocele</b> surgery: Lord's technique. The plication technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the plication technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>hydrocele</b> is not surgically removed, it may {{continue}} to grow. The <b>hydrocele</b> fluid can be aspirated. This procedure {{can be done in}} a urologist's office or clinic and is less invasive but, recurrence rates are high. [...] Sclerotherapy, the injection of a solution following aspiration of the <b>hydrocele</b> fluid may increase success rates. In many patients, the procedure of aspiration and sclerotherapy is repeated as the <b>hydrocele</b> recurs.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of a <b>hydrocele</b> {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from testicular cancer, as a <b>hydrocele</b> is soft and fluid-filled, whereas testicular cancer feels hard and rough.|$|E
50|$|Secondary hydroceles due to {{testicular}} diseases can be {{the result}} of cancer, trauma (such as a hernia), or orchitis (inflammation of testis), and can also occur in infants undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A <b>hydrocele</b> is not a cancer but it should be excluded clinically if a presence of a testicular tumor is suspected, however, there are no publications in the world literature that report a <b>hydrocele</b> in association with testicular cancer. Secondary <b>hydrocele</b> is most frequently associated with acute or chronic epididymo-orchitis. It is also seen with torsion of the testis and with some testicular tumors. A secondary <b>hydrocele</b> is usually lax and of moderate size: the underlying testis is palpable. A secondary <b>hydrocele</b> subsides when the primary lesion resolves.|$|E
50|$|The {{swelling}} is {{soft and}} non-tender, large in size on examination, and the testis cannot usually be felt. The presence of fluid is demonstrated by trans illumination. These hydrocoeles can reach a huge size, containing large amount of fluid, as these are painless and are often ignored. They are otherwise asymptomatic, other than size and weight, causing inconvenience. However the long continued presence of large hydroceles causes atrophy of testis due to compression or by obstructing blood supply. In most cases, the <b>hydrocele,</b> when diagnosed early during complete physical examination, are small and the testis can easily be palpated within a lax <b>hydrocele.</b> However Ultrasound imaging is necessary to visualize the testis if the <b>hydrocele</b> sac is dense to reveal the primary abnormality. But these can become large in cases when left unattended. Hydroceles are usually painless, as are testicular tumors. A common method of diagnosing a <b>hydrocele</b> is by attempting to shine a strong light (transillumination) through the enlarged scrotum. A <b>hydrocele</b> will usually pass light, while a tumor will not (except {{in the case of}} a malignancy with reactive <b>hydrocele).</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>hydrocele</b> testis is an {{accumulation}} of clear fluid in the tunica vaginalis, the most internal of membranes containing a testicle. A primary <b>hydrocele</b> causes a painless enlargement in the scrotum on the affected side and {{is thought to be}} due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary <b>hydrocele</b> is secondary to either inflammation or a neoplasm in the testis.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hydrocele</b> usually {{occurs on}} one side, {{but can also}} affect both sides. The {{accumulation}} can be a marker of physical trauma, infection, tumor or varicocele surgery, but the cause is generally unknown. Indirect inguinal hernia indicates increased risk of <b>hydrocele.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the diagnosis must be ascertained. Great {{care must be taken}} to differentiate a <b>hydrocele</b> from a scrotal hernia or tumor of the testicle. Ultrasound imaging can be very useful in these cases. A hernia usually can be reduced, transmits a cough impulse, and is not translucent. A <b>hydrocele</b> cannot be reduced into the inguinal canal and gives no impulse on coughing unless a hernia is also present. In young children a <b>hydrocele</b> is often associated with a complete congenital type of hernial sac.|$|E

A convenient method to differentiate the conditions is to transilluminate the scrotum, as the <b>hydrocele</b> will appear a soft red while a solid tumor will not transmit light.
