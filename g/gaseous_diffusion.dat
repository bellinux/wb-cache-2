5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure.

5|$|The <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> process {{remained}} more encouraging, {{although it}} too had technical obstacles to overcome. By {{the end of}} 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion.</b> The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944.

For the typical Reynolds numbers encountered in applications, the region of flame attachment, in the near wake at the injector rim, is small compared with the injector radius. The local flow, which we consider to be laminar, quasi-steady and two-dimensional, is determined by the wall value of the fuel stream velocity gradient and the chemical reaction time or residence time in the premixed flame of a stoichiometric mixture of the fuel stream and required amount of air.

5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb {{required}} fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E

The prototype <b>gaseous</b> <b>diffusion</b> equipment, two two-stage models and two ten-stage models, was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers {{at a cost of}} Â£150,000 for the four units. Two single-stage machines were later added. Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single-stage machine did not commence until June 1943, and with the two-stage machine until August 1943. The two ten-stage machines were delivered in August and November 1943, but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on a study of the {{behaviour}} of the multiple burner systems. The influence of number of burners, their separation and degree of swirl on the interaction of multiple <b>gaseous</b> turbulent <b>diffusion</b> flames, for different configurations chosen, has been investigated. A single flame has been studied as a reference flame to provide information for the comparison with multiple systems. The temperature and concentration profiles within the flames have been determined using thermocouples and a semi-continuous gas sampling system in conjunction with a gas chromatograph. Three orthoganol mean velocity components in the annular air stream of a single isothermal swirling jet have been measured using a hot wire anemometer and by the application of a four point measurement technique developed within the department. Multiple flame systems were found to be less stable against blow-off compared to single flames and the blow-off limit shifted towards the fuel rich region as the swirl was reduced. At low swirl levels and minimum separation the centre flames were lifted off the burner rim and were frequently blown-off. ...|$|R

The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor would it be possible to build a second plant.

The numerical model accounts for the important chemical and physical processes involved, including axial diffusion, viscous effects, radial convection, and finite-rate chemistry. The numerical results clearly show that the flame has a finite thickness and leakage of fuel vapor into the flame zone is possible. The effect of heat release is found to induce some radial flow. Predicted flame shape and dimensions are compared to the classical Burke-Schumann flame.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to the mathematical modelling of the combustiÃ³n of coal particles in pulverized coal furnaces. The model deals with the gas and solid phases of the flow. For the coal particles a Lagrangian description is used, taking into account the simultaneous processes of moisture evaporation and devolatilization together with the heterogeneous gasification reactions of the char. An Eulerian description will be used for the distributions of temperature and concentrations in the gas phase, with the effect of the particles represented by volumetric sources of heat, mass and momentum. The gas phase oxidation reactions of the volÃ¡tiles, H 2 and CO will be modelled using the assumption of infinitely fast rates; the Burke-Schumann analysis will be generalized to account for the competition for oxygen of CO, H 2 and the volÃ¡tiles. These reactions may occur, in the form of group combustiÃ³n, in a <b>gaseous</b> thin <b>diffusion</b> fÃ­ame separating a regiÃ³n without oxygen, where the coal particles genÃ©rate volÃ¡tiles, H 2 and CO, from a regiÃ³n with oxygen, where the reactions may occur inside the particles or, outside, in diffusion flames surrounding the individual particles, even though for small particle sizes the gas phase reactions can be considered as frozen near the particles.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a low-emissivity thermal management coating system to minimize radiative heat losses under a high-vacuum environment. Good adhesion, low outgassing, and good thermal stability of the coating material are essential elements for a long-life, reliable thermal management device. The system of electroplated Au coating on the adhesion-enhancing Wood's Ni strike and 304 L substrate was selected due to its low emissivity and low surface chemical reactivity. The physical and chemical properties, interface bonding, thermal aging, and compatibility of the above Au/Ni/ 304 L system were examined extensively. The study shows that the as-plated electroplated Au and Ni samples contain submicron columnar grains, stringers of nanopores, and/or H{sub 2 } gas bubbles, as expected. The grain structure of Au and Ni are thermally stable up to 250 C for 63 days. The interface bonding is strong, which {{can be attributed to}} good mechanical locking among the Au, the 304 L, and the porous Ni strike. However, thermal instability of the nanopore structure (i. e., pore coalescence and coarsening due to vacancy and/or entrapped <b>gaseous</b> phase <b>diffusion)</b> and Ni diffusion were observed. In addition, the study also found that prebaking 304 L in the furnace at {ge} 1 x 10 {sup - 4 } Torr promotes surface Cr-oxides on the 304 L surface, which reduces the effectiveness of the intended H-removal. The extent of the pore coalescence and coarsening and their effect on the long-term system integrity and outgassing are yet to be understood. Mitigating system outgassing and improving Au adhesion require a further understanding of the process-structure-system performance relationships within the electroplated Au/Ni/ 304 L system...|$|R

30|$|We {{have shown}} herein {{the role played}} by both time and {{pressure}} for reductive thermal decomposition of ATM for the formation of MoS 2 and their subsequent impact on HDS activity. The influence of decomposition time serves to both enable an increase in surface area as well as an increased likelihood of sintering. Pressure increases slow down thermal decomposition by limiting <b>gaseous</b> by-product <b>diffusion</b> {{while at the same time}} facilitating the collapse of produced pores. Based on FT-IR vibrational energies, FT-IR spectral analysis shows that catalysts prepared at higher pressures have weaker Mo-S bonds (378 Â cmâ 1) than those prepared at lower pressure (385 Â cmâ 1). Evidence from XRD indicates both time and pressure induce interlayer rotation of stacks along both the a- and c-axes and that ATM decomposition pressure plays a role in determination of MoS 2 layer stacking. Using XRD-derived values for crystallite sizes, theoretical surface area values were determined; the changes evident lead us to conclude that agglomeration is occurring. Optimal conditions were found producing a catalyst with weak Mo-S bonds, the largest (theoretical) surface area and largest pore volume which unsurprisingly resulted in the highest HDS activity of model dibenzothiophene. It was found that catalytic activity increased with a decrease in theoretical surface area, with 5 - 1, 000 having the highest activity per unit area. Samples prepared at low pressures yielded no detectible HYD product, but this increased in samples prepared at higher decomposition pressure. An optimal system was found which gave the lowest HYD:DDS ratio, again 5 - 1, 000. There is no doubt that there are other parameters which can impact both morphology and catalytic activity, such as ramp rates and variously substituted thiomolybdates; we have shown that the role of decomposition time and pressure for ATM-derived MoS 2 can in fact be a useful tool in optimizing catalyst synthesis with certain morphologies and activities.|$|R
40|$|High-index {{contrast}} waveguides now go 3 D on a photonic chip. One of {{the main}} limits of planar lightwave circuits is that they areâ¦ planar, indeed. Giving optical waveguides a third dimension would offer more flexibility to overcome the density and complexity limits of conventional photonic integrated architectures, with large benefits in optical interconnects applications. Direct laser writing is a well established technique to fabricate free-form 3 D optical waveguides, but until now {{it was supposed to}} be not suitable to realize high-index-contrast single-mode waveguides. Untrue, actually, because H. H. D. Nguyen and coworkers have just got it. They exploited 3 D femtosecond-laser curing of a newly developed photopolymer, followed by diffusion of a lower-index <b>gaseous</b> monomer. The <b>diffusion</b> of the guest monomer is the key of their method. It leads to a strong reduction of the refractive index of the uncured host polymer, as large as 0. 013; in contrast, the refractive index of the laser-cured polymer, that is the waveguide core, is almost not affected by the monomer diffusion process. This technique maintains all the main advantages of conventional 3 D laser writing schemes, such as the possibility to write multi layers of waveguides without any stacking or alignment effort, the need for neither wet chemical nor etching process, the use of only one layer of a single material. And waveguide propagation loss (0. 37 dB/cm at 850 nm) is nicely low. Monomer diffusion time, now in the order of several tens of hours, is a bit long, but H. H. D. Nguyen and coworkers are confident that it can be reduced to better meet commercial requirements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{diffusion}} {{and flow of}} sub-critical hydrocarbons in activated carbon by using a differential permeation method. The hydrocarbons are selected according to the effect on environmental concerns and their unique characteristics such as polarity and affinity towards activated carbon. Although it has been known that transport processes in activated carbon consist of Knudsen <b>diffusion,</b> <b>gaseous</b> viscous flow, adsorbed phase diffusion (so called, surface diffusion) and condensate flow, {{there have been no}} rigorous models to describe the transport processes in activated carbon with a full range of pressures. In particular among the four processes, the mechanism of adsorbed phase diffusion in activated carbon is still far from complete understanding. Also due to the dispersion interactions between adsorbing molecules and the solid surface, one would expect that Knudsen diffusion is influenced by the dispersive forces. From intensive experimental observations with a great care over a full range of pressures, conventional methods (for example, direct estimation from inert gas experiments) to determine adsorbed phase diffusion are found to be inadequate for strongly adsorbing vapors in activated carbon. By incorporating the effect of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions into Knudsen diffusivity, the general behavior of adsorbed phase diffusion in terms of pressure (or surface loading) can be obtained, showing a significant role in transport at low pressures. For non-polar hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane, a mathematical model, which accounts for the effects of adsorbate-adsorbent interactions and pore size distribution, is formulated and validated, resulting in a good agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the adsorption and dynamic behaviors of alcohol molecules (which are polar compounds) are investigated with an aim to compare their behaviors against those of non-polar compounds...|$|R
