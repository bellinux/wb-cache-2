25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when she was sick and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of the good ones. The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and now that she is dead, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E

500|$|Nafaanra {{has seven}} oral and five nasalized vowels. A {{difference}} in vowel length {{can make a}} difference in meaning, as in , [...] "to go", vs. , [...] "fetish" [...] or o, [...] "we" [...] vs. oo, [...] "we will". Similarly, the phonemic contrastiveness of nasalization can be seen in sii, [...] "to be giving birth," [...] vs. , [...] "to build". The vowel system closely resembles that of other Senufo languages. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> two Northern Senufo languages Supyire and Mamara in having only five nasal against seven oral vowels. In the orthography, nasalization of vowels is marked by adding the letter [...] "n" [...] after the vowel.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers likened Dishonored to well-received {{games from}} the early 2000s such as Deus Ex and the Thief video game series. The Telegraphs Tom Hoggins said <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> [...] "thinking man's games [...] {{the turn of the}} century which {{cherished}} player choice and control", comparing it against contemporary [...] "noisy, brash thrill-rides obsessed with military ooh-rah and barely interactive set pieces". Dale called Dishonored [...] "one of the greatest games of this generation", and wrote that it excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice. Dale also called it the first true stealth game for a long time, and the closest comparison to Thief in the current generation of games. Schreier stated that the game [...] " [...] the do-what-you-want structure of Deus Ex with the masterful world design of BioShock." ...|$|E

500|$|On 1 December, Benfica won {{its first}} league match {{in their new}} stadium, beating Rio Ave by 2–0. After the match, Camacho defended his team to the press by saying [...] "Eusébio's team is gone." [...] A week later, the team {{defeated}} Paços de Ferreira away, with João Pereira scoring two goals. Because Porto had lost points, Benfica were now only six points {{from the top of}} the league. On the 13th, Benfica won their fifth match in a row, beating Braga at home. After the game, Camacho angrily refuted any idea that Benfica did not play accordingly to expectations: [...] "A poor performance? That's not what I saw. In football there are two teams. Everyone knows that, against Benfica, all teams give their best, and we suffer that in the first half, because Braga played like every other team here. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> story of the bottle, for the optimist it is half full; for the pessimist, it is half empty." [...] On the same day, they were drawn with Rosenborg in the upcoming round of the UEFA Cup. The following Wednesday, Benfica progressed through the fifth round of the Portuguese Cup, with Luisão scoring a single goal in an away win against Académica. The final game of the month came on the 21st, with a 3–0 win to Estrela da Amadora. Two goals within the first ten minutes allowed the team to comfortably manage the remaining time. Camacho later said that Benfica could have scored six or seven goals. This was the team's seventh win in a row, the longest streak of consecutive wins in Camacho's time at Benfica.|$|E

2500|$|While appealing, these layman's {{versions}} of the paradox share a drawback: an easy refutation of the barber paradox {{seems to be that}} such a barber does not exist, or that the barber is a woman and therefore doesn't shave. The whole point of Russell's paradox is that the answer [...] "such a set does not exist" [...] means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference between the statements [...] "such a set does not exist" [...] and [...] "it is an empty set". <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> difference between saying, [...] "There is no bucket", and saying, [...] "The bucket is empty".|$|E

2500|$|The PCL:YV is an {{adaptation}} of the PCL-R for individuals aged 13–18 years. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> PCL-R, done by a trained rater based on an interview and an examination of criminal and other records. The [...] "Antisocial Process Screening Device" [...] (APSD) is also {{an adaptation}} of the PCL-R. It can be administered by parents or teachers for individuals aged 6–13 years. High psychopathy scores for both juveniles, as measured with these instruments, and adults, as measured with the PCL-R and other measurement tools, have similar associations with other variables, including similar ability in predicting violence and criminality. Juvenile psychopathy may also be associated with more negative emotionality such as anger, hostility, anxiety, and depression. Psychopathic traits in youth typically comprise three factors: callous/unemotional, narcissism, and impulsivity/irresponsibility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{full name}} of this rule should be [...] "kal va-chomer, chomer ve-kal" [...] (simple and complex, complex and simple), since by it {{deductions}} are made from the simple to the complex or vice versa, according {{to the nature of}} the conclusion required. The major premise on which the argument is based is called [...] "nadon," [...] or, at a later period, [...] "melammed" [...] (that which teaches); the conclusion resulting from the argument is termed בא מן הדין ("ba min ha-din", that which [...] "comes from the rule") or, later, [...] "lamed" [...] (that which learns). The process of deduction in the kal va-chomer is limited by the rule that the conclusion may contain nothing more than is found in the premise. This is the so-called [...] "dayyo" [...] law, which many teachers, however, ignored. It is formulated thus: דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון ("The conclusion of an argument is satisfied when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> major premise").|$|E
2500|$|The {{warning signal}} {{is the most}} unusual of {{the three types of}} British {{permissive}} signal. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> shunt-ahead, placed under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different. For a signalman to accept a train, both his block section and the line for a quarter mile inside his outer home signal must usually be clear; the quarter mile is a precaution in case the driver fails to stop in time for the outer home signal. However, it is possible to accept a train under the [...] "Warning Arrangement" [...] if the block section, but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding {{in the middle of that}} section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead.|$|E
