An unbalanced <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> {{is a rare}} chromosomal imbalance, which may result from a balanced <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> present in a phenotypically normal parent. We report here three brothers with intellectual disability, short stature, microcephaly, craniofacial anomalies and small testes.

The deletion encompassed the ZFPM 2 gene known to be involved in gonadal development, which is consistent with the small testes and abnormal endocrine dosages in the affected brothers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{preimplantation}} {{genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) is well established for carriers of reciprocal terminal translocations, reports on PGD for <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> carriers are lacking. Here, {{we report on the}} PGD of an <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> carrier with karyotype 46,XX,ins(14; 2) (q 21;q 31 q 35). Due to the possibility of crossovers within the inserted region, rather than a single probe, four probes are required for proper embryo selection. METHODS: Probes were generated for PGD using fluorescence in situ hybridization and two PGD cycles. RESULTS: Analysis of 10 embryos revealed four embryos to be normal diploid. Two embryos were consistent with 3 : 1 segregation of the theoretical quadrivalent and one was consistent with 2 : 2 or 1 : 1 segregation. Furthermore, one embryo was mosaic abnormal and one remained without diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: With increased acceptance of PGD, it is likely that more carriers of complex translocations will enter PGD programmes. The present results suggest that a careful genetic work-up of complex translocations is essential for proper embryo selection. While theoretical modelling may predict that quadrivalents will form during the meiosis of insertional translocations, experimental proof for the occurrence of quadrivalents is still lacking and more research on the meiotic process of both female and male <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> carriers is warranted. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In the Segregation distorter (SD) {{system of}} meiotic drive, {{a minimum of}} two {{trans-acting}} elements [Sd and E(SD) ] act in concert to cause a certain probability of dysfunction for sperm carrying a sensitive allele at the Responder (Rsp) target locus. By employing a number of <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations</b> of autosomal material into the long arm of the Y chromosome, Rsp can be mapped as the most proximal locus in the 2 R heterochromatin as defined both by cytology and lethal complementation tests. Several of these <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations</b> result in the transposition of Rsp to the Y chromosome, where its sensitivity remains virtually unaltered. This argues that Rsp is separable from the second chromosome centromere, that its behavior does not depend on its gross chromosomal position, and that meiotic pairing of the chromosomes carrying the various SD elements is not a prerequisite for sperm dysfunction. Several other translocations apparently leave both resulting chromosomes at least partially sensitive to SD action, suggesting that Rsp is a large subdivisible genetic element. This view is compatible with observations published elsewhere that suggest that Rsp is a cytologically large region of highly repetitive AT-rich DNA. The availability of Y-linked copies of Rsp also allows the construction of SD males carrying two independently segregating Rsp alleles; this in turn allows the production of sperm with zero, one or two Rsp copies from the same male. Examination of the relative recovery proportions of progeny arising from these gametes suggests that sperm with two Rsp copies survive at much lower frequencies than would be predicted if each Rsp acted independently in causing sperm dysfunction. Possible explanations for such behavior are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Rapid, {{effective}} {{techniques have}} been developed for detecting and characterizing chromosome aberrations in Neurospora by visual inspection of ascospores and asci. Rearrangements that are detectable by the presence of deficient, nonblack ascospores in test crosses make up 5 to 10 % of survivors after UV doses giving 10 - 55 % survival. Over 135 rearrangements have been diagnosed by classifying unordered asci according to numbers of defective spores. (These include 15 originally identified or analyzed by other workers.) About 100 reciprocal translocations (RT's) have been confirmed and mapped genetically, involving all combinations of the seven chromosomes. Thirty-three other rearrangements generate viable nontandem duplications in meiosis. These consist of <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations</b> (IT's) (15 confirmed), and of rearrangements that involve a chromosome tip (10 translocations and 3 pericentric inversions). No inversion has been found that does not include the centromere. A reciprocal translocation was found within one population in nature. When pairs of RT's that involve the same two chromosome arms were intercrossed, viable duplications were produced if the breakpoints overlapped {{in such a way that}} pairing resembled that of <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations</b> (27 combinations). —The rapid analytical technique depends on the following. Deficiency ascospores are usually nonblack (W: "white") and inviable, while nondeficient ascospores, even those that include duplications, are black (B) and viable. Thus RT's typically produce 50 % black spores, and IT's 75 % black. Asci are shot spontaneously from ripe perithecia, and can be collected in large numbers as groups of eight ascospores representing unordered tetrads, which fall into five classes: 8 B: 0 W; 6 B: 2 W, 4 B: 4 W, 2 B: 6 B, 0 B: 8 W. In isosequential crosses, 90 - 95 % of tetrads are 8 : 0. When a rearrangement is heterozygous, the frequencies of tetrad classes are diagnostic of the type of rearrangement, and provide information also on the positions of break points. With RT's, 8 : 0 (alternate centromere segregation) = 0 : 8 (adjacent- 1), 4 : 4 's require interstitial crossing over in a centromere-break point interval, and no 6 : 2 's or 2 : 6 's are expected. With IT's, duplications are viable, 8 : 0 = 4 : 4, 6 : 2 's are from interstitial crossing over, 0 : 8 's or 2 : 6 's are rare. Tetrads from RT's that involve a chromosome tip resemble those from IT's, as do tetrads from intercrosses between partially overlapping RT's that involve identical chromosome arms. —Because viable duplications and other aneuploid derivatives regularly occur among the offspring of rearrangements such as <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations,</b> care must be taken in selecting stocks, and original strains should be kept for reference...|$|R

The identification of a pathogenic copy number variant (CNV) is not only important to make a proper diagnosis but also to enable the accurate estimation of the recurrence risk to family members. Upon the identification of a de novo interstitial loss or gain the risk recurrence is considered very low. However, this risk is 50 % {{if one of the}} parents is carrier of a balanced <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation.</b> The apparently de novo imbalance in a patient is then the consequence of the unbalanced transmission of a derivative chromosome involved in an <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> (IT).

We demonstrate that insertional translocations underlie approximately 2. 1 % of the apparently de novo, interstitial CNVs, indicating that submicroscopic ITs are at least 6 fold more frequent than cytogenetically visible ITs.

The mutational spectrum of duplications has been studied at certain loci, {{and in some cases}} these copy-number gains are complex chromosome rearrangements involving triplications and/or inversions. However, the organization of clinically relevant duplications throughout the genome has yet to be investigated on a large scale. Here we fine-mapped 184 germline duplications (14. 7 kb– 25. 3 Mb; median 532 kb) ascertained from individuals referred for diagnostic cytogenetics testing. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to sequence 130 breakpoints from 112 subjects with 119 CNVs and found that most (83 %) were tandem duplications in direct orientation. The remainder were triplications embedded within duplications (8. 4 %), adjacent duplications (4. 2 %), <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations</b> (2. 5 %), or other complex rearrangements (1. 7 %). Moreover, we predicted six in-frame fusion genes at sequenced duplication breakpoints; four gene fusions were formed by tandem duplications, one by two interconnected duplications, and one by duplication inserted at another locus. These unique fusion genes could be related to clinical phenotypes and warrant further study. Although most duplications are positioned head-to-tail adjacent to the original locus, those that are inverted, triplicated, or inserted can disrupt or fuse genes in a manner that might not be predicted by conventional copy-number assays. Therefore, interpreting the genetic consequences of duplication CNVs requires breakpoint-level analysis...|$|R

A study was conducted that questioned {{the role of the}} organization of copy number variants and wondered what type of duplications they are. It was known that that copy number variation plays a big role in many human diseases but at the time large scale studies of these duplications had not been done. They decided to sequence 130 breakpoints from 112 individuals that contained 119 known CNVs by doing whole genome sequencing as well as next generation sequencing. They found that tandem duplications comprised 83% of the CNVs while 8.4% were triplications, 4.2% were adjacent duplications, 2.5% were <b>insertional</b> <b>translocations,</b> and 1.7% were other complex rearrangements. The copy number variants were predominantly tandem duplications which made it {{the most common type of}} copy number variant in the human genome according to the results of the study on this population.More was needed on the mechanistic side of the formation of structural variants. There was a study that focused on the mechanisms of very interesting and rare pathogenic copy number variants. The researchers knew that copy number variation is important in genome structural variation and contributes to human genetic disease but the actual mechanisms of most of the new and few pathogenic copy number variants had not been known. They used sequencing technologies to sequence breakpoint areas of many rare pathogenic copy number variants which was the biggest and most in depth analysis of copy number variants. They saw that the genomic architectural features were very important in the human genome and they were associated with about eighty-one percent of breakpoints. They concluded that tandem duplications and microdeletions that are rare and pathogenic do not happen in the human genome by chance. Instead, they arise from many different genomic architectural features. It was a very interesting result in that the certain architectural features of the genome physically made it possible and probable to develop certain rare and pathogenic structural variants.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Partial monosomies of {{chromosome}} 16 q {{are rare}} and overlapping effects from complex chromosomal rearrangements often hamper genotype-phenotype correlations for such imbalances. Here, we report the clinical features of an isolated partial monosomy 16 q 21 q 22. 1 in {{a boy with}} a complex de novo rearrangement possibly resulting from a chromothripsis event. RESULTS: The patient presented with low birth weight, microcephaly, developmental delay, facial dysmorphisms, short stature, dysmorphic ears and cardiopathy. Standard and molecular cytogenetics showed a complex rearrangement characterised by a pericentromeric inversion in one of chromosomes 12 and an inverted <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> of the 12 q 14 q 21. 1 region, from the rearranged chromosome 12, into the q 21 q 22. 1 tract of a chromosome 16. Array-CGH analysis unravelled a partial 16 q 21 q 22. 1 monosomy, localised in the rearranged chromosome 16. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the present case to other 16 q 21 q 22 monosomies contributed to narrow down the critical region for cardiac anomalies in the 16 q 22 deletion syndrome. However, more cases, well characterised both for phenotypic signs and genomic details, are needed to further restrict candidate regions for phenotypic signs in 16 q deletions. The present case also provided evidence that a very complex rearrangement, possibly caused by a chromothripsis event, might be hidden behind a classical phenotype that is specific for a syndrome...|$|E
40|$|In the {{majority}} of patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, duplication of the proteolipid protein gene PLP 1 is responsible, whereas deletion of PLP 1 is infrequent. Genomic mechanisms for these submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements remain unknown. We identified three families with PLP 1 deletions (including one family described elsewhere) that arose by three distinct processes. In one family, PLP 1 deletion resulted from a maternal balanced submicroscopic <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> of the entire PLP 1 gene to the telomere of chromosome 19. PLP 1 on the 19 qtel is probably inactive by virtue of a position effect, because a healthy male sibling carries the same der(19) chromosome along with a normal X chromosome. Genomic mapping of the deleted segments revealed that the deletions are smaller {{than most of the}} PLP 1 duplications and involve only two other genes. We hypothesize that the deletion is infrequent, because only the smaller deletions can avoid causing either infertility or lethality. Analyses of the DNA sequence flanking the deletion breakpoints revealed Alu-Alu recombination in the family with translocation. In the other two families, no homologous sequence flanking the breakpoints was found, but the distal breakpoints were embedded in novel low-copy repeats, suggesting the potential involvement of genome architecture in stimulating these rearrangements. In one family, junction sequences revealed a complex recombination event. Our data suggest that PLP 1 deletions are likely caused by nonhomologous end joining...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 45) Recombination frequencies {{were determined}} in regions adjacent to X-chromosome deletions, {{both in the}} heterozygous and the homozygous condition. In heterozygous condition, two separate deletions lying within a region marked by yellow (0. 0) and ruby (7. 5) produced a striking reduction as compared with values obtained in experiments with structurally normal chromosomes. One deficiency in the homozygous condition, provided with a duplication to prevent lethality, exhibited significantly more recombination in the marked interval than did its heterozygous counterpart. Results from the experiment with the homozygous deficiency were used to provide an accurate esttmate of the genetic extent of the deleted region. The observed value closely corresponded with the expectation derived from a combined genetic-cytological unit of measurement, namely, crossover frequency per salivary chromosome band, calculated from existing genetic and cytological data. Tests of recombination in homozygous deficient females required the introduction of an <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> to permit {{the survival of the}} females. Accordingly, the possible interchromosomal effects of three different insertional translocations on recombination in both deficient and structurally normal chromosomes were tested. No interchromosomal effects were shown to stem from their presence. However, a decrease in recombination was obtained in one homologous region of structurally normal chromosomes {{in the presence of the}} longest duplication tested, a finding consistent with the theory of competitive pairing. None of the inserted fragments affected recombination in a nonhomologous region of structurally normal chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|In several laboratories, {{genome-wide}} array {{analysis has}} been implemented {{as the first}} tier diagnostic test for the identification of copy number changes in patients with mental retardation and/or congenital anomalies. The identification of a pathogenic copy number variant (CNV) is not only important to make a proper diagnosis but also to enable the accurate estimation of the recurrence risk to family members. Upon the identification of a de novo interstitial loss or gain, the risk recurrence is considered very low. However, this risk is 50 % {{if one of the}} parents is carrier of a balanced <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> (IT). The apparently de novo imbalance in a patient is then the consequence of the unbalanced transmission of a derivative chromosome involved in an IT. To determine the frequency with which insertional balanced translocations would be the origin of submicroscopic imbalances, we investigated the potential presence of an IT in a consecutive series of 477 interstitial CNVs, in which the parental origin has been tested by FISH, among 14 [*] 293 patients with developmental abnormalities referred for array. We demonstrate that ITs underlie ∼ 2. 1 % of the apparently de novo, interstitial CNVs, indicating that submicroscopic ITs are at least sixfold more frequent than cytogenetically visible ITs. This risk estimate should be taken into account during counseling, and warrant parental and proband FISH testing wherever possible in patients with an apparently de novo, interstitial aberration.

40|$|Genes {{encoding}} proteins {{involved in}} {{the function of the}} nervous system can be identified via mutations causing behavioral abnormalities. An example is ether a go-go (eag) in Drosophila melanogaster, which was identified originally as an X-linked mutation that displayed ether-induced leg-shaking behavior. Electrophysiological and genetic evidence suggests that the product of the eag locus is intimately {{involved in the}} normal functioning of one or more types of voltage-gated potassium channels. To initiate a molecular analysis of eag we first generated a collection of deletions to pinpoint its cytological location. On the basis of this location, we identified an existing inversion, In(1) sc(29), with one breakpoint at the eag locus and the other in the scute (sc) complex. A genomic library was prepared from In(1) sc(29) and screened with a genomic DNA fragment that spanned the sc breakpoint to isolate DNA from the eag region. Beginning from this starting point over 85 kb of DNA were isolated by chromosome walking. Three additional eag alleles, including two dysgenesis-induced insertion mutations and a γ-ray-induced <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation,</b> were located on the molecular map of the eag locus by Southern blot analysis. The molecular defects associated with these alleles encompass a total of 27 kb within the chromosome walk. A 10 -kb transcript derived from this region, which is expressed most abundantly in heads, was identified on Northern blots. Two different eag mutations separated by over 20 kb interrupt the same transcript identifying it as the likely eag message. cDNAs representing a portion of this transcript have been isolated. The genomic DNA sequences from which these cDNAs are derived extend over 37. 5 kb, providing a minimum estimate {{of the size of the}} eag transcription unit. Ultimately, sequence analysis of these cDNAs should enable us to the identify the eag polypeptide and to elucidate its role in membrane excitability...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectrum}} of congenital eye malformations including microphthalmia (small eyes), anophthalmia (absent eyes) and coloboma (ventral eye defects), or MAC, causes blindness in approximately 1 in 10, 000 children. We have discovered novel RBP 4 coding and SOX 3 regulatory mutations {{in patients with}} MAC disease. RBP 4 encodes plasma retinol binding protein, a lipocalin that transports vitamin A, an essential nutrient for eye development, in the bloodstream. We show RBP 4 missense mutations p. A 73 T and p. A 75 T alter the ligand-binding pocket, causing autosomal dominant MAC with reduced penetrance and a maternal parent-of-origin effect. Both mutant alleles encode dominant-negative RBPs that bind poorly to vitamin A but strongly to the STRA 6 receptor on recipient cell membranes. Consequently, a vitamin A “bottleneck” is created at the maternal-fetal interface, {{which is likely to}} reduce vitamin A delivery to the fetus, particularly when the mutation is inherited from the mother. This is the first report of such a defective interfering allele for a blood cargo protein in human disease. In a separate case, we describe a novel SOX 3 regulatory mutation in a 46,XX child with bilateral anophthalmia and SRY-negative female-to-male sex reversal. In this patient, a paternal de novo 9 q 21 Xq 27 <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> has juxtaposed TRPM 3 exons 1 and 2 downstream from SOX 3, at the midpoint of a 180 -bp pallindrome. This implicates a dominant, gain-of-function mechanism whereby ectopic SOX 3 transcription disrupts early eye and gonadal development. Transgenic mouse models test this hypothesis and reveal sensitivity of the developing eye to alterations in SoxB 1 (Sox 2) spatiotemporal activity. This thesis highlights genetic and environmental factors that influence eye development, and it has broad implications for other congenital disorders...|$|E
40|$|Three glycerol-nonutilizing mutants {{deficient}} in the mitochondrial glycerol- 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 99. 5) were isolated from inlts derivatives of Neurospora crassa following inositolless death at elevated temperatures on minimal glycerol medium. These mutants failed to grow on glycerol as a sole carbon source, but could grow on acetate, glucose, or mannitol media and were female fertile in genetic crosses, thereby distinguishing {{them from the}} previously reported polyol-protoperithecial defective Neurospora mutants. In addition, these glp mutants exhibited a distinct morphological alteration during vegetative growth on sucrose slants and colonial growth on sorbose-containing semicomplete medium. The glp- 2 locus was assigned a location between arg- 5 and nuc- 2 on chromosome IIR {{on the basis of}} two-factor crosses and by duplication coverage by <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> ALS 176, but not NM 177. All mutations were allelic as judged from the absence of both complementation in forced heterokaryons and genetic recombination among glp- 2 mutations. The reversion frequency of all three mutations was less than 1010, indicating probable deletions in these strains. No G 3 P dehydrogenase activity could be detected in either cytosolic or mitochondrial extracts from mutant strains grown on glycerol, glucose, or galactose media. These results suggest that the glp- 2 locus may be the structural gene for both the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of G 3 P dehydrogenase or for a cytosolic precursor of the mitochondrial G 3 P dehydrogenase. The defect is specific for the G 3 P dehydrogenase since normal activities of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase and the cytosolic glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductase are detected in mutant extracts. During attempted growth of glp- 2 mutants on glycerol media, there was an accumulation of G 3 P in culture filtrates, a reduction in the mycelial growth rate, and a decreased level of glycerokinase induction...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal {{microarray}} {{analysis has}} gradually replaced conventional karyotyping over {{recent years in}} the postnatal setting which has revolutionized whole genome screening for genomic imbalances in patients. We sought to evaluate the benefits and the challenges of applying chromosomal microarrays to prenatal diagnosis for referrals with abnormal ultrasound findings. Our findings, presented in Chapter 3, demonstrate a diagnostic yield of ~ 10 %. Importantly, ~ 3 % are caused by submicroscopic CNVs which would go undetected by conventional karyotyping alone. Furthermore, the higher resolution offered by chromosomal microarray analysis led to important additional information in ~ 4 % of patients. Of particular interest we discover a novel and unexpected advantage of arrays; a 500 kb paternal <b>insertional</b> <b>translocation</b> is the likely driver of a de novo unbalanced translocation, thus improving recurrence risk calculation in this family. Our study has, in part, {{paved the way for}} the recent Summary Guidelines for Prenatal Chromosomal Microarray Analysis and Genetic Counselling from the Belgian Society for Human Genetics [[URL] The implementation of prenatal chromosomal microarray analysis as the first tier test in place of conventional karyotyping brings the standard of prenatal diagnosis in line with that which is provided for postnatal genetic diagnosis. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening prenatal disorder detectable by ultrasound during pregnancy. We sought to further unravel the genetic factors underlying isolated CDH by the design of a custom microarray covering genomic loci recurrently associated with CDH and candidate CDH genes. Our retrospective screen of 79 isolated CDH patients using this custom microarray is presented in Chapter 4. This study identified a novel duplication of the EFNB 1 gene in a male patient which was considered likely to be pathogenic. Since our publication, a second case of a male CDH patient with duplication of EFNB 1 was reported, thus reinforcing EFNB 1 dosage sensitivity as a cause of isolated CDH. In order to further identify (novel) CNVs and genes associated with isolated CDH, we undertook a prospective prenatal study using chromosomal microarrays with genome-wide coverage in 75 foetuses with isolated CDH, which is presented in Chapter 4. This study revealed submicroscopic de novo pathogenic CNVs in 9. 3 % and rare inherited variants which may be involved in CDH in a further 4 % of foetuses. This diagnostic yield is significantly higher than the ~ 3 % rate of pathogenic submicroscopic CNVs which we observed in our prenatal study using the same microarray platform. Isolated CDH thus represents a valid cohort for CNV screening in the prenatal phase, and suggests that the clinical utility of conventional karyotyping is questionable for this group of patients. This study allowed us to further refine the critical region at 15 q 26 to only 2 genes, pinpointing NR 2 F 2 as the causal gene. We add further evidence for the 15 q 25. 2 and 16 p 11. 2 recurrent microdeletions as CDH loci, and we identify novel CNVs not previously observed in association with CDH, including a duplication of 4 p 15. 2 -p 14. We next evaluated the use of exome sequencing for the investigation of isolated CDH and non-isolated CDH where a genetic cause was suspected. Our results show that exome sequencing represents an effective technique with which to investigate familial CDH, described in Chapter 5. In the first family studied, we identified a nonsense mutation in ZFPM 2 in 2 individuals with isolated CDH, as well as a sibling with a congenital heart defect. Surprisingly, the mutation was shown to be transmitted from the unaffected mother, and is also carried by the maternal grandfather and the maternal sister, both of whom are also asymptomatic. This intriguing finding highlights the complexity of CDH, reinforcing the involvement of additional as yet unidentified (epi) genetic factors in CDH penetrance. In a second family with 2 male foetuses with MCA, we identify a mutation in the X-linked PORCN gene inherited from an unaffected mother who was shown to have extreme skewing of X-inactivation. This further implicates Wnt signaling as playing a role in CDH, as well as multiple aspects of foetal development. In a third consanguineous family we identify a mutation in PIGN in a foetus with MCA, inherited from carrier parents. PIGN is involved in GPI anchor synthesis and our finding adds to a growing body of evidence that defective GPI anchor synthesis causes multiple phenotypes in humans. Given the variation in severity of herniation and thus pulmonary hypoplasia, as well as differences in responses to foetal and / or neonatal therapy for CDH patients, we sought to explore whether gene expression analysis of amniotic fluid cells from CDH foetuses could identify dysregulated genes and biological pathways which may act as predictive biomarkers. In this exploratory study we applied RNA-sequencing to investigate gene expression in cultured cells sourced from amniotic fluid of isolated CDH patients, described in Chapter 6. This analysis identifies 2 potential molecular subtypes of isolated CDH, one of which is characterized by downregulation of TGFB 1 and CTGF, and upregulation of TNF, IL 6 and IL 8. This highlights downregulation of TGFB signalling as a likely cause of much of of the downstream dysregulation in gene expression observed, including that of CTGF which has been previously implicated in the nitrofen rodent model of CDH. Furthermore, this group of patients shows an apparent inflammatory response indicated by the upregulation of TNF, IL 6 and IL 8 which may in turn exacerbate postnatal pulmonary hypertension. These findings direct future targeted studies in a larger cohort of isolated CDH patients to determine the clinical significance and therapeutic potential. status: publishe...|$|E
