The domain binds to a seven-nucleotide sequence of DNA (positions 1 through 6 on the primary strand of DNA, plus positions 0 and 3 on the complementary strand), thereby {{ensuring that the}} protein motif is highly selective of its target.

40|$|In the postgenomic era many {{experiments}} rely on {{the availability}} of transcript sequence for cloning. As these clones usually originate from cDNA libraries, the quality of these libraries is crucial. If a good library is generated it is desirable to use a versatile cloning system suitable for many different kinds of applications. The cloning systems based on <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombination</b> proves fitting for this task. However, the use of this method for shuttling entire cDNA libraries between different vectors has not yet been studied in great detail. Here we describe the construction of four cDNA libraries from different tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana, the shuttling of the libraries into expression vectors, and evaluation of this method as well as its suitability for downstream applications. Libraries were constructed from seedlings, hormone treated seedlings, flowers, developing seeds and primary leaves in the ldquoentry vectorrdquo of the Gatewaytrade cloning system. After initial characterization of the libraries, they were shuttled into an expression vector (a yeast two-hybrid prey vector). To monitor for a size bias generally assumed to be inherent to <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombination</b> methods, the libraries were characterized before and after the transfer into the expression vector. However no significant difference could be detected. The functionality of the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombination</b> system for the shuttling of entire libraries was then further tested by protein-protein interaction screens. The results of the library characterization and of the yeast two-hybrid screens and their implications for large-scale proteomic approaches are discussed...|$|E

Here, we derived in silico the sequence of the putative ancestral “progenitor” element {{of one of the most}} recently amplified family—the HERV-K family—and constructed it. This element, Phoenix, produces viral particles that disclose all of the structural and functional properties of a bona-fide retrovirus, can infect mammalian, including human, cells, and integrate with the exact signature of the presently found endogenous HERV-K progeny. We also show that this element amplifies via an extracellular pathway involving reinfection, at variance with the non-LTR-retrotransposons (LINEs, SINEs) or LTR-retrotransposons, thus recapitulating ex vivo the molecular events responsible for its dissemination in the host genomes. We also show that <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombinations</b> among present-day human HERV-K (also known as ERVK) loci can similarly generate functional HERV-K elements, indicating that human cells still have the potential to produce infectious retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|Substrains of mice {{carrying}} Moloney {{murine leukemia}} virus as a Mendelian gene (Mov locus) have been derived previously. Some of these strains, i. e., Mov- 3 and Mov- 9, develop viremia, whereas others, i. e., Mov- 2, Mov- 7, and Mov- 10, do not regularly activate virus. We previously have molecularly cloned the respective Mov loci and shown that proviral clones derived from the different viral loci were either infectious (Mov- 3, Mov- 9) or failed to induce infectious virus (Mov- 2, Mov- 7, Mov- 10) in a transfection assay. To analyze the sites affecting infectivity of the latter clones, complementation assays, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombinations,</b> and marker rescue experiments were performed.

40|$|A system {{capable of}} in vitro {{packaging}} of exogenous bacteriophage T 7 DNA {{has been used}} to monitor the biological activity of DNA replicated in vitro. This system {{has been used to}} follow the effects of UV radiation on in vitro replication and recombination. During the in vitro replication process, a considerable exchange of genetic information occurs between T 7 DNA molecules present in the reaction mixture. This <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombination</b> is reflected in the genotype of the T 7 phage produced after in vitro encapsulation; depending on the genetic markers selected, recombinants can comprise nearly 20 % of the total phage production.

30|$|The {{directed}} evolution approach (Fig.  17, the right panel) involves many technologies, such as gene library diversification, genotype–phenotype linkage technologies, display technologies, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) technologies, and phenotype detection and evaluation technologies [172]. This approach mimics {{the process of}} natural selection (Darwinian evolution) to evolve proteins toward a target goal. It involves subjecting a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis (creating a molecular library with sufficient diversity for the altered function), selection (expressing the variants and isolating members with the desired function), and amplification (generating a template for the next round). This process can be performed in vivo (in living cells), or <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> (free <b>in</b> solutions or microdroplets). Molecular diversity is typically created by various random mutagenesis and/or <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> gene <b>recombination</b> methods, as described in “Gene engineering”.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin and}} {{evolution}} of sex, and the associated role of recombination, present {{a major problem in}} biology. Sex typically involves recombination of closely related DNA or RNA sequences, which is fundamentally a random process that creates but also breaks up beneficial allele combinations. Directed evolution experiments, which combine <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> mutation and <b>recombination</b> protocols with <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> or <b>in</b> vivo selection, have proved to be an effective approach for improving functionality of nucleic acids and enzymes. As this approach allows extreme control over evolutionary conditions and parameters, it also facilitates the detection of small or position-specific recombination benefits and benefits associated with recombination between highly divergent genotypes. Yet, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> approaches have been largely exploratory and motivated by obtaining improved end products rather than testing hypotheses of recombination benefits. Here, we review the various experimental systems and approaches used by <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> studies of <b>recombination,</b> discuss what they say about the evolutionary role of recombination, and sketch their potential for addressing extant questions about the evolutionary role of sex and recombination, in particular on complex fitness landscapes.

50|$|This <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> {{homologous}} <b>recombination</b> method {{begins with}} the synthesis of many short gene fragments exhibiting point mutations using random sequence primers.

This method is advantageous relative to DNA shuffling {{because there is no}} use of DNase1, thus there is no bias for recombination next to a pyrimidine nucleotide. This method is also advantageous due to its use of synthetic random primers which are uniform in length, and lack biases. Finally this method is independent of the length of DNA template sequence, and requires a small amount of parental DNA.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntI 1 {{integrase}} is a tyrosine recombinase {{involved in}} the mobility of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes within bacterial class 1 integrons. Recent data have shown that its recombination specifically involves the bottom strand of the attC site, but the exact mechanism of the reaction is still unclear. An efficient <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> assay is still required to better characterize the biochemical properties of the enzyme. In this report we describe {{for the first time}} an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> system partially reproducing the activity of a recombinant pure IntI 1.

40|$|AbstractTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) {{superfamily}} signaling {{has been}} implicated in many developmental processes, including pancreatic development. Previous studies are conflicting with regard to an exact role for TGF-β signaling in various aspects of pancreatic organogenesis. Here we have investigated the role of TGF-β isoform signaling in embryonic pancreas differentiation and lineage selection. The TGF-β isoform receptors (RI, RII and ALK 1) were localized mainly to both the pancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme at early stages of development, but then with increasing age localized to the pancreatic islets and ducts. To determine the specific role of TGF-β isoforms, we functionally inactivated TGF-β signaling {{at different points in}} the signaling cascade. Disruption of TGF-β signaling at the receptor level using mice overexpressing the dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor showed an increase in endocrine precursors and proliferating endocrine cells, with an abnormal accumulation of endocrine cells around the developing ducts of mid–late stage embryonic pancreas. This pattern suggested that TGF-β isoform signaling may suppress the origination of secondary transition endocrine cells from the ducts. Secondly, TGF-β isoform ligand inhibition with neutralizing antibody in pancreatic organ culture also led to {{an increase in the number}} of endocrine-positive cells. Thirdly, hybrid mix-and-match <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>recombinations</b> of transgenic pancreatic mesenchyme and wild-type epithelium also led to increased endocrine cell differentiation, but with different patterns depending on the directionality of the epithelial–mesenchymal signaling. Together these results suggest that TGF-β signaling is important for restraining the growth and differentiation of pancreatic epithelial cells, particularly away from the endocrine lineage. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the embryonic period may thus allow pancreatic epithelial cells to progress towards the endocrine lineage unchecked, particularly as part of the secondary transition of pancreatic endocrine cell development. TGF-β RII in the ducts and islets may normally serve to downregulate the production of beta cells from embryonic ducts...|$|R
