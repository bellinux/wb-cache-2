5|$|A desert <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and {{for the development of}} their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Tartikoff, {{one of the}} show's producers, {{felt that}} Fox was too short in {{relation}} to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." [...] After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription [...] "To Brandon, this is for you to put your crow in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." [...] Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office {{for the rest of his}} NBC career.|$|E
500|$|One review {{about the}} soundtrack said that, [...] "this is no {{ordinary}} album and will be preferred by musical elites. Infused with classical music and Rajasthani folk music, {{it is a good}} quality album coming out of Salim-Sulaiman. But the shortcoming comes in the form that this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> music that'll please every ear." [...] Another review, in a similar tone, said that the album [...] "works only for those who are either followers of classical music or enjoy hearing songs with a Rajasthani folk music base. There is no doubt that composers good quality throughout, but overall the album caters only to a niche audience." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain {{acknowledges}} {{having said}} intemperate things in years past, though {{he also says}} that many stories have been exaggerated. One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper, and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate, engaged, fiery, and feisty. McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion, although such incidents have become less frequent over the years. Lieberman has made this observation: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person." [...] Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks, expressed concern about a McCain presidency: [...] "He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me." [...] Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination.|$|E

50|$|Describing {{the buying}} as very selective, John L. Marion, Sotheby's chairman, said: On the one hand, {{it is the}} highest total ever for an Old Master sale in America and there were 11 artist's records set. On the other hand, you could observe {{the fact that there}} was little or no bidding from dealers.

2500|$|In Chakrabarty {{the issue}} was whether the words “manufacture” and “composition of matter” in §101 “included such living things as bacteria–a {{substance}} to which neither of the two specific plant Acts refers.” The Chakrabarty Court then decided that §101 covered “a 'new' bacterium because it was 'a non-naturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter' that was 'not nature’s handiwork.'” [...] It said nothing about plants (such as corn). Further a bacterium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> plant that the PPA and PVPA “had in mind.” Thus, “Chakrabarty neither asked, nor answered ... the question now before us.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Pipes's views gained {{widespread}} {{public attention}} when they triggered a filibuster in the United States Senate against his nomination by President George W.

Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) explained that he was [...] "offended" [...] by Pipes's comments on Islam, and that while [...] "some people call [...] a scholar... this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> person you want on the USIP." [...] While defending Pipes's nomination, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer distanced Bush from Pipes's views, saying that Bush [...] "disagrees with Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion".|$|E

2500|$|To Judge Rich, {{even though}} section 101 says [...] "whoever invents or discovers," [...] {{there is no}} basis for {{importing}} into the analysis any inquiry {{into the nature of}} what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether {{it is the kind of}} thing that can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because [...] "§ 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in § 102 and § 103." [...] The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is [...] "new, useful, and unobvious." ...|$|E

[...] José María López felt his team were due to secure a good finish following a poor performance in the previous race and said they had been preparing hard for the event. He was looking forward to competing in Paris {{for the first time and}} expected to achieve a good points-scoring position. Heidfeld was seeking another podium finish to enable Mahindra to keep third place in the Teams' Championship but was wary of cold weather conditions which caused several cars to struggle with cold tyre temperatures in the previous year's race. Vergne felt his home event of Paris would be his [...] "best race of the year" [...] and praised the effort the city put in to stage the annual contest, [...] "The Paris track <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> track we have been to except for Hong Kong - really bumpy, narrow, difficult to drive - so we'll see how it goes." ...|$|E

Killinger, [...] "the Fascists were anti-Salvemini before he became anti-Fascist, and their efforts to silence him made his name synonymous with early Italian resistance to the new regime." [...] Although a prolific historian, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of person to separate scholarship from political activity. Throughout his exile he actively organized resistance to Mussolini, assisting others in escaping Italy, while he {{played an important role in}} spurring both elite and public opinion in America against the Fascist regime.|$|R

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of cricket I want to watch.

I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|R

30|$|Low-wage workers tend {{to leave}} jobs {{for a variety}} of reasons. For example, some have {{short-term}} contracts, which they often accept reluctantly because they have difficulty finding more permanent employment. Some, of course, cannot meet employers’ performance expectations. Others leave work by choice, because <b>the</b> jobs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of work they want to do, they are unhappy with the pay or work conditions, or they experience situational problems that undermine their performance. Lone parents often encounter particular difficulties with the cost and reliability of childcare and transport, balancing work and childcare responsibilities, and employers who are unwilling to accommodate their employees’ family responsibilities.|$|R
