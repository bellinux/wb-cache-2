In {{all there was}} peripheral or central nervous system damage or both. Standard tests of autonomic function showed vagal neuropathy in seven. The remainder had normal autonomic function tests. Twenty four <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate variability was measured as the standard deviation of the successive differences between RR intervals from an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording. Twenty four <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate variability was significantly lower in both alcohol dependent groups than in controls, but the results in the two alcohol dependent groups {{were not significantly different}} from each other. The results of standard tests of autonomic function did not distinguish between the alcohol dependent men with normal autonomic function and controls. The differences in heart rate variability between this group and the controls may have been the result of the ability of this method to detect small changes in autonomic integrity. Cardiomyopathy may also account for some of these differences and such abnormalities should be excluded before results are to be regarded as a reflection of vagal function. Twenty four hour measurement of heart rate variability may be a more useful index of cardiac vagal neuropathy than currently available tests of autonomic function...|$|E

40|$|Objective—Low {{intake of}} omega- 3 fatty acids (FAs) is {{associated}} with depression and with low heart rate variability (HRV), and all three are {{associated with an increased}} risk of death in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether omega- 3 FA increases the natural log of Very Low Frequency (lnVLF) power, an index of HRV, and reduces 24 <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate (HR) in depressed patients with CHD. Methods—Thirty-six depressed patients with CHD randomized to receive 50 mgs of sertraline and two grams of omega- 3 /day, and 36 randomized to sertraline and a placebo, had 24 hour HRV measured at baseline and following 10 weeks of treatment. Results—There was a significant treatment X time interaction for covariate adjusted lnVLF (p= 0. 009), for mean 24 hour HR (p = 0. 03), and for one minute resting HR (p = 0. 02). The interaction was not significant for three other measures of HRV.

We previously observed an increase in arrhythmias during spontaneous prolonged hypoglycemia in T 2 DM patients. Our aim was to examine changes in cardiac autonomic function and repolarization during sustained experimental hypoglycemia. Twelve adults with T 2 DM and eleven age, BMI-matched nondiabetic controls underwent paired hyperinsulinemic clamps separated by 4 weeks. Glucose was maintained at euglycemia (6. 0 mmol/L) or hypoglycemia (2. 5 mmol/L) for one <b>hour.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability were assessed every thirty minutes and corrected QT (QTc) and T wave morphology every 60 minutes. Heart rate initially increased in T 2 DM participants but then fell towards baseline despite maintained hypoglycemia at 1 hour, accompanied by reactivation of vagal tone. In nondiabetic participants, vagal tone remained depressed during sustained hypoglycemia. Diabetic participants exhibited greater heterogeneity of repolarization during hypoglycemia as demonstrated by T wave symmetry and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ratio compared with the nondiabetic group. Epinephrine levels during hypoglycemia were similar between groups. Cardiac autonomic regulation during hypoglycemia appears time-dependent. T 2 DM individuals demonstrate greater repolarization abnormalities for a given hypoglycemic stimulus despite comparable sympathoadrenal responses. These mechanisms could contribute to arrhythmias during clinical hypoglycemic episodes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{our study}} is to {{evaluate}} the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the percutaneous closure of PFO (abnormal communication between {{the right and left}} atrium). Methods: Between July 2009 and October 2012 percutaneous closure was performed in 37 patients. The presence of PFO was diagnosed through the use of ultrasound techniques: transcranial doppler with contrast (cTCD), transthoracic echocardiography(TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Follow-up was composed consisted of a Holter ECG 7 days after the closure with a 24 <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rhythm monitoring, to evaluate eventual arrhythmia cases and programmed controls which included a TTE at 1 - 3 months, TTE+ cTCD at 6 - 12 months, to evaluate the right positioning of the device and the complete closure of the defect. Results: We obtained 100 % of procedural success (correct and stable implantation of the device in a perfect position on the interatrial septum). No complications were recorded during the procedure and no new onset atrial fibrillation was detected in any patients after the PFO closure. The follow up with cTCD and TEE reported a closing rate of 86. 7 %. No new clinical cerebrovascular events occurred in treated patients until now. Conclusion: Our experience describes the percutaneous PFO procedure as feasible, safe and effective with a high rate of procedural success, with an absence of significant adverse events and a high rate of complete closure. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

DESIGN: A double blind, randomised crossover study. SETTING: Nottingham. SUBJECTS: 101 subjects with mild or moderate asthma taking at least 200 micrograms twice daily of beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide. INTERVENTIONS: Salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily and placebo for six months each, with a one month washout. Subjects adjusted inhaled steroid dose according to guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reduction in inhaled steroid use, exacerbations of asthma, and use of oral steroids. RESULTS: Data were available for 87 subjects. When compared with placebo salmeterol treatment was associated with a 17 % reduction in inhaled steroid use (95 % confidence interval 12 % to 22 %) with {{no significant difference in the}} number of subjects who had an exacerbation (placebo 25 %, salmeterol 16 %) or use of oral steroids.

This study investigated the effect of chewing on alertness and cognitive performance across one night without sleep as well as the possible mediating role of cardiac autonomic activity. Fourteen adults participated in a randomized, counterbalanced protocol employing a chewing, placebo and caffeine condition. Participants completed tasks assessing psychomotor vigilance, tracking, grammatical reasoning, alertness and sleepiness each hour across the night. All participants received either placebo or caffeine (200 mg), while the chewing condition also chewed on a tasteless and odorless substance for 15 min each <b>hour.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate (HR), root mean square of the successive differences in R-R intervals on the ECG (RMSSD), and preejection period (PEP) were simultaneously recorded. Alertness and cognitive performance amongst the chewing condition did not differ or were in fact worse when compared with placebo. Similarly, measures of HR and RMSSD remained the same between these two conditions; however, PEP was reduced in the later part of the night in the chewing condition compared with a relative increase for placebo. Caffeine led to improved speed and accuracy on cognitive tasks and increased alertness when compared with chewing. Relative increases in RMSSD and reductions in HR were demonstrated following caffeine; however, no change in PEP was seen. Strong associations between cardiac parasympathetic activity and complex cognitive tasks, as well as between subjective alertness and simpler cognitive tasks, suggest a differential process mediating complex versus simple cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.

Research in this field is complicated due to use of different statistical models and inadequate cardiovascular measurements. I intended {{to find out whether}} the difference in body size between IUGR and normal infants persisted through the childhood and whether there were any differences in cardiovascular parameters and maturation of circadian biorhythms between these groups. 75 nine year olds were recruited and forty-one of them were IUGR. All the children had their twenty-four <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate variability, blood pressure and urinary Cortisol excretion measured. IUGR children showed a greater increase in their weight between birth and nine years but the z scores for current weight, height and Body Mass Index (BMI) and incidence of obesity were higher in the control group. Both groups showed similar diurnal variation of all cardiovascular parameters and no evidence of the cardiovascular system being dominated by the Sympathetic nervous system in the IUGR children, which could have been detrimental to their cardiovascular health. The Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) was significantly higher in the control group. Later weight was the better predictor of SBP. BMI {{was a significant predictor of}} SBP. Urinary cortisol/Creatinine ratio was not different between the two groups. I conclude that IUGR children grow faster but remain shorter and lighter than their normal counterparts. IUGR children on average are physiologically indistinguishable from normal children and do not show any abnormality in the cardiovascular parameters, which could link them to future disease. Normal children have higher SBP than the IUGR children which is related to larger body mass. The current body size appears to have more impact on the level of blood pressure at the age of nine years compared to IUGR...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones greatly {{affect the}} {{cardiovascular}} system. Although {{the effects of}} overt hyperthyroidism on the cardiovascular system have been diffusely studied, {{only in the last}} years the effects of subclinical hyperthyroidism on the heart have been investigated. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a symptomatic or asymptomatic condition with an absent response of thyrotropin (TSH) to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the presence of normal serum levels of thyroid hormones for the general population, though supraoptimal for the individual. The more frequent causes of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism are multinodular goiter, toxic, adenoma and Graves's disease, whereas the exogenous causes are induced by levothyroxine (LT 4) therapy used to suppress TSH in patients with nontoxic goiter and differentiated thyroid cancer. This paper reports our experience derived from the study of 60 patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism due to TSH-suppressive therapy with LT 4 compared to normal subjects. METHODS: Patients (9 males and 51 females, mean age 39 +/- 10 years) were studied by complete Doppler echocardiography, standard and 24 hour ECG Holter monitoring, exercise test with cycloergometer, and radionuclide ventriculography at rest and during fixed workload (75 W). RESULTS: Holter monitoring showed a significant increase in mean 24 <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate (80 +/- 10 vs 70 +/- 9 b/min, p < 0. 001) and supraventricular arrhythmias (42 vs 12 patients, p < 0. 003).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the atrial electrophysiology and autonomic nervous system in patients who had paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) associated with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Background. PAF frequently appeared in patients with PSVT. However, the critical determinants for the occurrence of PAF were not clear. Methods. This study population consisted of 50 patients who had PSVT with (n = 23) and without (n = 27) PAF. Atrial pressure, atrial size, atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs), and AERP dispersion were evaluated during baseline and PSVT, respectively. Twenty-four <b>hour</b> <b>heart</b> rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were also examined. Results. There was greater baseline AERP dispersion in patients with PAF than in those without PAF. The atrial pressure, atrial size, AERPs in the right posterolateral atrium and distal coronary sinus, and AERP dispersion were increased during PSVT as compared with those during baseline. Patients with PAF had greater AERP dispersion than those without PAF during PSVT. The differences of atrial size, right posterolateral AERP, and AERP dispersion between baseline and PSVT were greater in patients with PAF than in those without PAF. BRS, but not heart rate variability, was higher in patients with PAF than in those without PAF. Univariate analysis showed that higher BRS (> 4. 5 ms/mm Hg, p = 0. 0002, odds ratio = 16. 1), AERP dispersion during PSVT (> 40 ms, p = 0. 0008, odds ratio = 9. 7), and increase of right atrial area during PSVT (> 2 cm 2, p = 0. 016, odds ratio = 10. 7) were significantly correlated with the occurrence of PAF in patients with PSVT.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although {{heart rate}} {{variability}} has already been studied in survivors of sudden cardiac death secondary to coronary artery disease, an assessment of {{heart rate variability}} in survivors of sudden cardiac death not associated with coronary artery disease has not been made. METHODS [...] 10 patients with aborted sudden cardiac death not associated with coronary artery disease (seven patients with primary ventricular fibrillation and three with unclassified mild cardiomyopathy) underwent two channel 24 hour Holter monitoring in a drug free state. All subjects were in sinus rhythm and had normal atrioventricular conduction and normal cardiac function. Spectral heart rate variability was analysed on a Holter analysis system and was expressed as total (0. 01 - 1. 00 Hz), low (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz) and high (0. 15 - 0. 40 Hz) frequency components for each <b>hour.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate variability index was calculated for the 24 hour periods. 10 age and sex matched healthy subjects were taken as a control group. RESULTS [...] The spectral heart rate variability over 24 hours was significantly lower in survivors of sudden cardiac death than in controls (total 38 (15) v 48 (14) ms; low, 25 (11) v 32 (13) ms; and high, 13 (8) v 18 (8) ms; p < 0. 05 for all comparisons). The differences in the ratio of low/high (2. 19 (0. 76) v 1. 98 (0. 50), p = 0. 132), mean heart rate (77 (12) v 69 (12) beats/min, p = 0. 070), and heart rate variability index (38 (12) v 44 (16), p = 0. 287) over 24 hours between survivors of sudden cardiac death and controls did not reach significance. Comparisons of the hourly heart rate variability over the 24 hour period {{between the two groups}} showed that the differences in all components of heart rate variability, low/high ratio and mean heart rate were highly significant. Furthermore, {{there was no significant difference}} in the maximum hourly heart rate variability over the 24 hour period. The minimum hourly heart rate variability was, however, significantly lower in survivors of sudden cardiac death than in controls (total, 20 (8) v 28 (4) ms; low, 12 (6) v 17 (3) ms; high, 6 (2) v 8 (2) ms; p < 0. 05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that there is abnormal autonomic influence on the heart in patients without coronary artery disease at risk of sudden cardiac death.

40|$|The use of {{simulated}} altitude is frequently {{used in an}} attempt to enhance athletic performance. Similar techniques have also recently been used in a clinical population to improve cardiovascular risk. However, the effects of different frequencies of {{simulated altitude}} per week, follow up assessments and the effects of passive simulated altitude in addition to exercise (rather than exercising in hypoxia) has not been tested in a sedentary, middle-aged population. To simulate altitude, an intermittent hypoxic exposure (IHE) protocol was used whereby 5 -min of hypoxia was alternated with 5 -min of normoxia for 1 <b>hour.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate variability (HRV), i. e. the beat-to-beat fluctuations between R-peaks, cardiovascular fitness (VO 2 peak), systolic blood presssure (SBP), highly-sensitive C-Reactive protein (hs-CRP, indicative of systemic inflammation associated with athlersclerosis), high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and arterial stiffness were used to assess cardiovascular health during 3 IHE studies. In the first study, 4 IHE sessions/week for 4 weeks resulted in increased HRV compared to a placebo treatment (71. 6 ± 52. 5 %, mean between-group change from the natural logarithm ± 90 % confidence interval), indicating increased parasympathetic activity. The second study assessed the effects of IHE frequency on selected risk factors. Following the 5 -week intervention, HRV (during paced breathing) increased in participants given both 2 - 3 (IHE 3) and 5 (IHE 5) IHE sessions per week (IHE 5 : 47. 3 ± 41. 6 %; IHE 3 : 6. 2 ± 6. 9 %), thereby confirming the changes in HRV reported in Study 1. In addition, haemoglobin concentration (2. 7 ± 2. 8 %), time taken to complete the maximal fitness assessment (34. 5 ± 36. 8 %), and maximal workload (14. 4 ± 14. 9 %) were increased in IHE 5 compared to the control group, while changes in hs-CRP (12. 7 ± 48. 7 %) were trivial. None of these changes were seen in IHE 3. There was an increased VO 2 peak (12. 6 ± 9. 3 %) in IHE 3 compared to the Control, but not IHE 5. Due to the benefical effects on VO 2 peak and HRV, 2 - 3 IHE sessions/week were used together with 3 exercise sessions/week (IHE 3 +Ex), and compared to exercise only (Ex) in the third study. Immediately post intervention, 4 - and 8 -wk follow up measurements were taken. Both groups showed a tendency to decrease total cholesterol, improve arterial compliance (pulse wave velocity) and increase VO 2 peak and HRV, but these changes were unclear. High density lipoprotein (Post: 8. 0 ± 8. 0 %; 8 -wk: 10. 0 ± 8. 5 %), SBP (Post: - 3. 4 ± 3. 4 %; - 3. 5 ± 3. 7 %) improved in IHE 3 +Ex more than Ex, and while VO 2 peak was qualitatively unclear at Post it was increased at the 4 -wk (9. 4 ± 8. 0 %) and 8 -wk (7. 9 ± 8. 3) follow-up sessions. While differences in systemic arterial stiffness (augmentation index) was unclear between groups at Post, the augmentation index increased at 4 - and 8 -wk (4 -wk: 11. 8 ± 18. 4 %; 8 -wk: 24. 8 ± 19. 7 %) in the IHE 3 +Ex group compared to Ex. Overall, IHE appears to increase the parasympathetic contribution to the sympathovagal balance of the heart at rest in sedentary middle-aged participants, and may improve SBP and some fitness parameters, particularly with 4 – 5 IHE sessions/week. While the short-term effects of IHE on arterial health are promising, more research on the long-term effects of IHE treatments is needed before IHE can conclusively be considered ‘safe’...|$|E

Methodology: Sprague- Dawley rats were assigned to hemorrhage, hemorrhage + EIPA, sham hemorrhage and sham hemorrhage + EIPA groups. Rats were hemorrhaged for one <b>hour.</b> <b>Hearts</b> were harvested and ex vivo treated and resuscitated by perfused in the Langendorff System. Myocardial function was determined. Results: The results showed that inhibition of the Na +-H + exchanger using EIPA improved the post-resuscitation myocardial contractile function. Conclusion: Blocking the Na +-H + exchanger using 100 mM EIPA following 60 minutes of hemorrhagic shock improved myocardial function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: The {{effects of}} {{different}} modes of mechanical ventilation {{in the same}} ventilatory support level on ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction onset were assessed in healthy rabbits. Methods: Twenty New Zealand rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} 4 groups (n 5 5 in each group). Group 1 : no mechanical ventilation; group 2 : controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) for 24 hours; group 3 : assist/ control ventilation (A/C) mode for 24 hours; group 4 : high-level pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode for 24 <b>hours.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate, mean arterial blood pressure, PH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide were monitored and diaphragm electrical activity was analyzed in the 4 groups. Caspase- 3 was evaluated by protein analysis and diaphragm ultra structure was assessed by electron microscopy. Results: The centroid frequency and the ratio of high frequency to low frequency were significantly reduced in the CMV, A/C and PSV groups (P, 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{study of}} two groups of nine {{allergic}} asthmatic children, consisting of one group with (group I) and one group without (group II) increased nocturnal airflow obstruction, we determined whether an increase in vagal activity, or inflammatory mediators like histamine {{are responsible for the}} nocturnal increase in airflow obstruction. The results of investigations in the two groups of asthmatics were compared to the results of an age matched control group. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and electrocardiogram recordings of one minute were obtained every 4 hours during 24 <b>hours.</b> <b>Heart</b> rate and sinus arrhythmia gap were used to express vagal activity indirectly. N tau-methylhistamine was determined in urine samples collected in periods of 4 hours between the measurements. In group I, overall N tau-methylhistamine excretion was on a higher level than in both other groups, and was significantly higher overnight. Parasympathetic stimulation did not seem of importance to the increase of airflow obstruction at nigh...|$|R
