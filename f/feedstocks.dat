40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of the monomodal and bimodal MIM <b>feedstock</b> are presented in this paper. Coarse and fine SS 316 L gas atomized powders are mixed with PEG and PMMA to form a homogenous paste, which is termed as <b>feedstock.</b> The surface active agent used here is stearic acid. The bimodal powders are blended from 30 to 70 % of the coarse powder distribution. Results show that monomodal <b>feedstock</b> exhibits a higher viscosity over the bimodal <b>feedstock</b> at low shear rate. Binder separation {{is also likely to}} occur in the monomodal <b>feedstock</b> prepared with coarse powder especially at a high injection temperature. Furthermore, bimodal <b>feedstock</b> is less viscous than the monomodal <b>feedstock</b> but the particle size distribution has shown its influence on viscosity. The flow behavior index decreases when the temperature increases. The investigation also shows that the <b>feedstock</b> flow sensitivity depends on the fine powder distributions in the <b>feedstock.</b> Since all the <b>feedstock</b> demonstrates a good pseudo plastic behavior, it therefore is suitable to be injection molded...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main <b>feedstocks</b> for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E

However, due to the morphology of the water atomized powder which is not spherical compared to the gas atomized ones, fine powder <b>feedstock</b> is unable to produce any significant rheological result due to the powder loading being more than 63. 5 v/o.

This paper presents experimental works concerning semisolid metal processing of aluminium 7075 <b>feedstock</b> billets which were produced by direct thermal method. The flowability of <b>feedstock</b> billets was evaluated by an injection test processing unit. The <b>feedstock</b> billets were heated to a temperature of 620 °C by using a box furnace before transferred into a forming die. The formed <b>feedstock</b> billet {{was removed from the}} forming die after it was cooled to ambient temperature. Several analyses were conducted on the formed <b>feedstock</b> billets including dimensional measurement and microstructure analysis. The results show that the <b>feedstock</b> billets which contained the highest amount of free secondary phase were most successfully formed. Microstructure analysis results also revealed the formation of more globular and larger α–Al solid grains in the same <b>feedstock</b> billets. In this experimental work, the <b>feedstock</b> billets with higher amount of secondary (liquid) phase had a significant effect on formability. It is concluded that in order to achieve successful formability of the direct thermal method <b>feedstock</b> billets, the billets need to a have higher secondary phase content.

Cobalt catalysts are more active for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality <b>feedstocks</b> such as coal or biomass. Synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor <b>feedstocks</b> has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water–gas shift reaction. Unlike the other metals used for this process (Co, Ni, Ru), which remain in the metallic state during synthesis, iron catalysts tend to form a number of phases, including various oxides and carbides during the reaction. Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles.|$|E
