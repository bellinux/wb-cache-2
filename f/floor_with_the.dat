The {{buildings are}} covered with thick white limestone or sandstone. The buildings usually have balconies on each <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of the ground floor, which has a front and back yard. Some buildings make use of Mangalore tiles on the roofs or {{on the roof of}} covered porches. Hotels, towers and commercial buildings are either covered by stone, plastic or glass.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the main}} family sitting room on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> south-facing grand window giving views to the gardens, and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533. In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood {{paneling}} (including Ionic pilasters) and the internal porch: these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts. In the 20th century the room was {{being used as a}} store for farm equipment. Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the panelling to reveal the original warm-coloured oak.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> executive offices on the four floors below it. Below that are more offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0). They {{defeated}} the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game ball.|$|E
5|$|The garrisons of the Device Forts {{comprised}} {{relatively small}} teams {{of men who}} typically {{lived and worked in}} the fortifications. The garrisons would maintain and care for the buildings and their artillery during the long periods of peacetime and, in a crisis, would be supplemented by additional soldiers and the local militia. The size of the garrisons varied according to the fortification; Camber Castle had a garrison of 29, Walmer Castle 18, while the West Tilbury Blockhouse only held 9 men. The ordinary soldiers would have lived in relatively basic conditions, typically on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> captains of the fortifications occupying more elaborate quarters, often in the upper levels of the keeps. The soldiers ate meat and fish, some of which might have been hunted or caught by the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
25|$|Thornton Hospital {{opened in}} 1993 as a {{standalone}} general medical-surgical hospital with 119 beds {{and a full}} range of specialties. The construction of Jacobs Medical Center was originally intended as a simple expansion of the hospital, but evolved into the ten-story quaternary care facility that exists today. In 2016, the hospital was consolidated into the Jacobs Medical Center complex as its own pavilion. It shares a first, second and third <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new inpatient tower and a first and second <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Perlman Medical Offices outpatient clinic, and continues to offer services such as surgery and radiology.|$|E
25|$|Storms, fire, {{and high}} {{maintenance}} costs caused major {{problems in the}} centuries after 1600. The monastery underwent many changes until 1930. The west facade was demolished sometime after 1755, and so were the upper <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brothers' cells (1834) and the dilapidated vaults in the church (1837). Unlike all the other monasteries in Groningen, {{a large part of}} the original buildings remained.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} one-story building {{probably had}} the workshops {{on the ground}} <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> living quarters and state rooms on the main floor. After the death of Domenico in 1458, his brother Angelo, also a cardinal, enlarged the palace, but reserved {{part of the building}} for the family, who later created a theatre from existing family apartments without changing the exterior of the building.|$|E
25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|E
25|$|The side facades {{are similar}} to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. Both sides are in five bays, all windows, on the first <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{exception}} of a door on the east side. The second-floor openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it.|$|E

25|$|Parliament first sat at {{the former}} {{headquarters}} building of the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force on a hill near Jalan Tun Ismail (Maxwell Road). The Dewan Negara met in a hall {{on the ground floor}} while the Dewan Rakyat met in the hall on the first <b>floor.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> completion of Parliament House in 1962, comprising a three-storey main building for the two houses of Parliament to meet, and an 18-storey tower for the offices of Ministers and members of Parliament, both houses moved there.|$|E
25|$|The primary work {{is between}} mother and therapist. It {{is based on the}} notion of the infant as {{initiator}} in infant–parent psychotherapy. For half the session the mother gets down on the <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|E
25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on the <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E
30|$|From the Tables  1 and 3, it is {{seen that}} the {{responses}} of two adjacent structures, when they are connected at all <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same damping in all the dampers {{and when they are}} connected with 50 % of total dampers with different damping coefficient, are almost nearer. Hence, it leads to conclude that the reduction in the responses, when connected with 50 % of total dampers with different damping in LED is as much as when they are connected at all <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same damping in all the LED, reduces the cost of the dampers almost 50 %.|$|R
50|$|One Utah Center is a {{skyscraper}} {{in downtown}} Salt Lake City, Utah. It {{was built by}} the Boyer Company in 1991. The building has 24 <b>floors</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 24th containing two conference rooms.|$|R

25|$|Lowestoft Town Hall {{stands on}} the High Street. Various forms of local {{government}} have met or been based on this site since {{the establishment of a}} Town House and Chapel here in 1570. In 1698 a new Town House was built, incorporating a 'corn cross' on the ground <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meeting chamber and chapel above. This in turn was replaced by the present building, designed by architect J. L. Clemence, in 1857. The building houses the town clock and the curfew bell, which dates from 1644 and is rung each evening at 8pm. The building is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|The only brick {{stations}} were Tønsberg Station and Larvik Station, designed in Historicism and Renaissance Revival. In {{addition to these}} stations' size, it was decisive that local building restrictions banned wooden buildings. The two stations had the same floor plan and design, but Larvik was slightly longer. Their design was inspired from the main farmhouses of Jarlsberg and Larvik. The {{stations were}} innovative for their design with a central vestibule with direct access to both the town and track sides, with branches to waiting rooms for second and third class. They were also innovative in that the upper <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> station-master's residence, was smaller than the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} facade includes to bell {{towers and}} {{is divided into}} three floors decorated in cornice. The towers, are delimited by a central section with pilasters, corresponding to the lateral corps and surmounted by bulbous copulas over octagonal base. There are four sections on all floors, with the last one occupied by the belfry. The central part, corresponds to the nave, and there are three sections per <b>floor</b> (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> doorways on the ground floor decorated in archways) and surmounted by a cut frontispiece with decorated tympanum. There is an inscription on the archway entrance to the left part of the church, that reads 1838.|$|E
