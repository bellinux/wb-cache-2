5|$|The first Olympic <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> tournament {{took place}} at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. At the time, {{organized}} international <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> was still relatively new. The International <b>Ice</b> <b>Hockey</b> Federation (IIHF), the sport's governing body, was created on May 15, 1908, under the name Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace. At the 1914 Olympic Congress in Paris, <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> was added to the list of optional sports that Olympics organizers could include. The decision to include <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> for the 1920 Summer Olympics was made in January, three months {{before the start of the}} Games. Several occurrences led to the sport's inclusion in the programme. Five European nations had committed to participating in the tournament and the managers of Antwerp's Palais de Glace stadium refused to allow the building to be used for figure skating unless <b>ice</b> <b>hockey</b> was included. The IIHF considers the 1920 tournament to be the first <b>Ice</b> <b>Hockey</b> World Championship. From then on, the two events occurred concurrently, and every Olympic tournament until 1968 is counted as the World Championship. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to play.|$|E
