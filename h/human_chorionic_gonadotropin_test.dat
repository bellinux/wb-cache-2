40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and validate algorithms to detect pregnancies from the time of first clinical recognition by using Kaiser Permanente automated databases from Portland, Oregon. In 1993 – 1994, the authors evaluated these databases retrospectively to identify markers indicative of initial clinical detection of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy markers were found for 99 % of the women for whom pregnancy outcomes were included in the automated databases, and pregnancy outcomes were identified for 77 % of the women for whom there were pregnancy markers. The earliest marker most predictive of a pregnancy outcome was a positive human chorionic gonadotropin test; least predictive was an obstetric outpatient visit. Medical record review indicated that in a sample of women with pregnancy markers in the database, an estimated 6 % of pregnancy outcomes (primarily early fetal deaths and elective terminations) were lost. Pregnancies were first captured in automated databases 6 – 8 weeks after the last menstrual period, and a combination of a positive <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> <b>test</b> and an outpatient obstetric visit was the most sensitive and specific early marker of pregnancy.

40|$|Deficiency of 17 β-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} type 3 (17 βHSD 3), {{an enzyme}} converting androstenedione (A) to testosterone (T), {{is a rare}} cause of autosomal recessive 46,XY disorder of sexual development (DSD). A 18 -years phenotypically female patient from southern Italy presented with primary amenorrhea. She had deep voice, macrocephaly, enlarged and bulbous nasal tip, macrostomia, facial acne, breast asymmetry, hypoplasia of the first finger of right hand, proximal implant of the fifth metatarsus bilaterally {{as well as an}} increased muscle mass and hirsutism, with hair distribution on face, neck, chest, abdomen, pubic region and on upper and lower limbs. Genital exam showed thickened labra majora with absence of labra minora and a blind-ending pseudo-vagina with clitoris enlargement. Karyotype analysis showed a male genotype (46,XY). Hormonal evaluation showed decreased T (188 ng/dL- 6. 5 nmol/L) and increased A (10 ng/mL- 34, 96 nmol/L), considering male reference ranges, resulting in a decreased T/A ratio (0, 186). MRI identified testicles in inguinal regions. <b>Human</b> <b>Chorionic</b> <b>Gonadotropin</b> <b>test</b> showed T/A ratio permanently under 0, 8.

Subcutaneous administration of Cetrorelix 250 microg once daily for 5 days resulted in partial suppression of serum LH and testosterone.

40|$|Introduction. Transvaginal {{sonography}} and <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) <b>testing</b> are cornerstones {{of modern}} clinical practice in cases with the suspected ectopic pregnancy. In unclear cases, if {{the level of}} hCG is above the discriminatory zones, the use of uterine curettage is recommended. There is an increasing concern that strict observation of the guidelines would potentially harm otherwise normal early intrauterine pregnancies in certain cases. Case Outline. A 35 -year-old woman was admitted to hospital due to a severe lower abdominal pain. Based on the positive pregnancy test and sonographic exams which failed to demonstrate intrauterine pregnancy, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was presumed. Laparoscopy revealed ruptured corpus luteum cyst and the diagnosis was confirmed on histopathological finding. Postoperatively, normal intrauterine gestation was visualized. Conclusion. Since the diagnosis of early pregnancy and its complications can be misleading, in unclear cases, we support the expectative “wait and see” management consisting of serial hCG testing and repeated ultrasound examinations. Avoidance of uterine curettage in such unclear cases would further reduce the possibility of normal early pregnancy interruption...|$|R

40|$|Simvastatin is an {{inhibitor}} of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the {{key enzyme}} in {{the synthesis of}} cholesterol, recently introduced in the therapy of hypercholesterolemic patients. Cholesterol is the precursor of the biosynthesis of steroid hormones; thus, a reduction {{of the availability of}} cholesterol in the adrenal and testicular cells may reduce the synthesis of corticosteroids and androgens. To establish whether chronic therapy with simvastatin interferes with the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and with the adrenal and testicular reserve, we administered simvastatin orally in a single-day 10 mg dose for 6 months in 8 mildly hypercholesterolemic male patients. At weeks 0, 6 and 24 of treatment we evaluated the lipids, the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by means of the Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) test, the adrenal reserve by means of the Corticotropin rapid test and, finally, the testicular reserve by means of the <b>Human</b> <b>Chorionic</b> <b>Gonadotropin</b> (HCG) <b>test.</b> Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced by Simvastatin, while the HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides did not change significantly.

40|$|Failure {{to detect}} {{pregnancy}} {{in the emergency}} situations can have important consequences. These include missing of ectopic pregnancy (the leading cause of first-trimester pregnancy-related maternal death), administration of medications contraindicated in pregnancy, fetal radiation exposure, and medico legal problems. This in turn {{has led to the}} dictum to check for pregnancy in all women of child-bearing age group. Urine pregnancy (<b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> [hCG]) <b>test</b> is the commonly used test to rule out pregnancy and has been reported by Griffey et al. in their study to achieve 100 % sensitivity and 99. 2 % specificity in a clinical setting, resulting in a positive predictive value of 98. 3 % and a negative predictive value of nearly 100 %. However, the sensitivity is influenced not only by the quantity of β hCG but on its variants that vary with different weeks of pregnancy. β hCG is present in several variant forms that change in their concentrations at different stages of pregnancy. In spite of its high sensitivity, in the presence of molar pregnancy that is associated with very high levels of β hCG it fails to detect the antigen (β hCG). This is explained by the phenomenon known as "high-dose hook effect" which further leads to delay in diagnosis and treatment. This can be overcome by dilution of the sample. In such cases, diagnosis will be made by serum β hCG and ultrasound (USG).

Testosterone and SHBG levels (mean +/- SD) were measured before (d 0) and after (d 5) a hCG test (1500 IU x 3 d). Testosterone levels (nmol/L) increased in all groups [AIS: from 1. 5 +/- 1. 2 to 22. 1 +/- 11. 8 (p < 0. 001); other-MPH: from 0. 6 +/- 0. 6 to 9. 2 +/- 7. 4 (p < 0. 02); controls: from 1. 8 +/- 1. 4 to 22. 8 +/- 14. 4 (p < 0. 001) ]. SHBG concentrations (nmol/L) did not change in AIS [from 66. 2 +/- 15. 1 to 67. 5 +/- 18. 6 (p = NS), h-variation 1. 7 +/- 12. 7 %], whereas they were significantly decreased in other-MPH [from 59. 9 +/- 14. 2 to 46. 5 +/- 18. 6 (p < 0. 005), Delta-variation - 23. 7 +/- 19. 6 %] and controls [from 63. 0 +/- 16. 9 to 33. 7 +/- 14. 6 (p < 0. 003), Delta-variation - 46. 9 +/- 15. 2 %].

40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} ovarian follicles declines with age {{resulting}} in a significant decrease of fertility {{by the age of}} 40. However, the age when follicle loss starts to affect ovarian endocrine function is not well recognized. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate age-related ovarian/adrenal androgen secretion, which is crucial for estrogen biosynthesis in healthy women and in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Another aim of the study was to compare the usefulness of different serum markers in assessing ovarian aging and in diagnosing polycystic ovaries (PCOs) and PCOS. The <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) <b>test</b> was used to study the endocrine potential of ovaries/adrenals. The ovarian capacity to secrete and synthesize androgens was found to be decreased as early as at the age of 30 in regularly menstruating women. In women with PCOS, both basal and hCG-stimulated androgen levels were about 50 % higher than in healthy women and they remained high until late reproductive age. Similarly to regularly menstruating women, the androgen secretion capacity in PCOS subjects decreased with age, and estradiol concentrations remained unchanged until the age of 44 years. Adrenal androgen synthesis was not changed during hCG-tests. Since serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were changed significantly after the age of 25 years in regularly menstruating women, they may be considered as useful serum markers reflecting the ovarian aging process. In women with PCOS, AMH levels were continuously 2 - to 3 -fold higher than in healthy women possibly reflecting high follicle number in these women. A decline in ovarian endocrine function before the age of 30 is one of the first signs of ovarian aging. However, in women with PCOS ovarian androgen secretion capacity is markedly increased and remain high throughout the reproductive years. The results of the present studies also indicate that LH/hCG does not play a role in adrenal androgen synthesis, since LH/hCG did not stimulate adrenal androgen synthesis. The measurement of AMH is a useful tool to estimate ovarian aging process as well as to diagnose PCOs/PCOS...|$|R

A gonadtropin releasing hormone (GnRH) <b>test</b> and <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) stimulation <b>test</b> revealed low responses of LH, FSH and a normal response of testosterone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed slight depression of the diaphragma sellae, indicating an "empty sella". We diagnosed acquired hypogonadtropic-hypogonadism related empty sella. An hCG replacement therapy was introduced and after 3 months the patient's capacity to ejaculate was restored and testis volume was 14 ml on both sides. Six months after hormone replacement therapy, semen analysis revealed azoospermia. Then we added r-hFSH to his treatment and expect his sperm to reappear. 40 歳男。射精障害を主訴に受診し、二次性徴、性機能、射精に異常は認めなかった。直腸診で小さな前立腺を触知し、テストステロンの低値、LHとFSHは基礎値が低く、GnRH負荷試験では低反応を示した。頭部MRIではくも膜下腔がトルコ鞍内へ陥入し、下垂体が鞍底部に圧排されて菲薄化しており、トルコ鞍洞症に伴う後天性低ゴナドトロピン性性腺機能低下症と診断した。hCG自己皮下注射の治療開始後 2 ヵ月で射精が出現し、 6 ヵ月後には精液量、精巣容量、public hair stage、テストステロンも改善したが無精子症のためr-hFSH製剤自己注射を追加した...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{study the}} value of {{assessing}} serum concentrations of luteinising hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in patients with male undermasculinisation not caused by androgen insensitivity.  METHODS—A retrospective study of a register of cases of male undermasculinisation (20 with abnormal testes, eight with 5 α-reductase deficiency, three with testosterone biosynthetic defects, seven with Drash syndrome, and 210 undiagnosed).  RESULTS—A <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) stimulation <b>test</b> was performed in 66 of 185 children with male undermasculinisation. In 41 of 66 patients the dose of hCG was either 1000 U or 1500 U on three consecutive days. The rise in testosterone was related to basal serum testosterone and was not significantly different between the two groups. Testosterone:DHT ratio in patients with 5 α-reductase deficiency was 12. 5 - 72. 8. During early infancy, baseline concentrations of LH and FSH were often within normal reference ranges. In patients with abnormal testes, median pre-LHRH (luteinising hormone releasing hormone) concentrations of LH and FSH were 2 and 6. 4 U/l, respectively, and post-LHRH concentrations were 21 and 28 U/l. An exaggerated response to LHRH stimulation was observed during mid-childhood in children where the diagnosis was not clear and in all children with abnormal testes.  CONCLUSIONS—The testosterone:DHT ratio following hCG stimulation is more reliable than the basal testosterone:DHT ratio in identifying 5 α-reductase deficiency. During infancy, the LHRH stimulation test may be more reliable in identifying cases of male undermasculinisation due to abnormal testes than basal gonadotrophin concentrations. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Beyond pregnancy, {{persistent}} {{low levels}} of hCG {{may be associated with}} various benign and malignant conditions, i. e. quiescent gestational trophoblastic disease (QTD), raised pituitary hCG or false positive elevation caused by circulating heterophilic antibodies. This situation requires a clinico-biological approach in order to avoid misunderstandings that could lead to inappropriate diagnostic or therapeutic attitudes. Observation: A 23 years old woman (GOPO status) consulted his gynaecologist because of persistent abdominal pain. She was diagnosed of having trophoblastic disease on the basis of persistently positive <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) <b>test</b> (Roche Modular) results, in the absence of pregnancy. Persistent {{low levels of}} hCG (around 10 U/L) were detected in her plasma. The patient underwent a trial with methotrexate chemotherapy. Abdominal pain was unrelieved whereas plasma hCG was 8. 9 U/L. A serology test for Chlamydia indicated persistent infection and a course of antibiotic treatment was underwent without any relief. A laparoscopic exploration ruled out any trophoblastic residue or pelvic adherences. The patient was referred to the Endocrine Unit for further pituitary and hormonal investigations. Plasma and urine samples were sent to Biology Service to exclude a false hCG positive value. While low levels of hCG were detected in serum by assay, no significant hCG was detected in the urine (0, 1 U/L). When serum was treated with HBT tube for the detection of heterophilic antibodies, hCG levels were 0. 98 U/L. After mouse serum treatment, hCG was not further detected in our patient, indicating the presence of phantom hCG due to the presence of human anti mouse heterophilic antibodies. Conclusions: Textbooks on obstetrics and gynecology emphasize the importance of plasma hCG testing in patients with trophoblastic diseases. The ability of laboratory measurements to guide the clinician appropriately in every circumstance is limited. Caution should be exercised when clinical findings and laboratory results are discordant. Current protocols for the diagnosis and treatment of trophoblastic disease should include a compulsory test for hCG in urine and a test for heterophilic antibodies when appropriate. In this case report, we demonstrated that phantom hCG, was caused by heterogenous human anti mouse antibodies. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Last decades, we have {{observed}} major improvements in treating infertility by using microinjection. However, reduction in abortion or increase in fertility {{has not been}} significant. It seems use of corticosteroids improves clinical outcomes during assisted reproductive technology (ART) techniques. Therefore, this study tried to show how corticosteroids therapy improves the results of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Methods: This semi clinical trial study without control group was included infertile women {{with more than one}} year’s infertility and were candidate to ICSI which were referred to Kosar Infertility Center, Urmia University of Medical Sciences from April 2011 to September 2013. Patients received prednisolone which was started 20 mg/day from one day before embryo transfer to 7 days, then for 2 days more 1 tablet and stopped. Pregnancy outcomes were chemical and clinical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and rate of abortion before 20 weeks. Beta <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (HCG) <b>test</b> was performed. Patients with positive pregnancy test were followed by sonography in 6, 12 weeks and 20 weeks of pregnancy. Results: One hundred and eighty one patients entered to the study. The mean± SD of age and fertility duration were 30. 42 ± 6. 07 and 7. 69 ± 5. 54 years. The mean± SD of transferred embryo was 4. 60 ± 1. 10 and embryo grading was 138 (44. 7 %) grade A, 124 (40. 1 %) grade B, 47 (15. 2 %) grade C, respectively. There were no significant difference between fresh/frozen embryo transfer in pregnancy outcomes (P> 0. 05 in all of outcomes comparison). The incidence rate of biochemical pregnancy was 48. 1 % (87), clinical pregnancy rate with appearance of fetal heart was 44. 2 % (80), incidence rate of abortion before appearance of fetal heart (6 weeks) in women with intra-uterine pregnancy was 5. 9 % (5), incidence rate of abortion before 20 weeks was 12. 9 % (11). Incidence rate of ectopic pregnancy was 2. 3 % (2) and rate of multiple pregnancies was 32. 5 % (26). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the infertile patients who receive prednisolone in ICSI cycle, had improved pregnancy outcomes. Additional confirmatory studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|Pubertal {{development}} {{is associated with}} a rise in plasma insulin-like growth factor I(IGF-I) levels that is related both to the increase in sex steroids and/or to the sex steroid-induced augmentation in endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion. In order to investigate the relationship between IGF-I, GH and testosterone, we examined 12 male subjects with various clinical conditions (classical GH deficiency (CGHD, N = 5), non-classical GH deficiency (NCGHD, N = 7), short idiopathic stature (N = 6), nutritional obesity (N = 8), GH-treated CGHD (N = 4), GH-treated NCGHD (N = 5) and normal stature (N = 7)) in which, for evaluation of hypogonadism (i. e. the absence of one or both testes from the scrotal sac), <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) <b>tests</b> were performed, We measured IGF-I, total and free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) by radioimmunoassays before and 48 and 96 h after the start of the test. The values of IGF-I were lower (0. 001 < p < 0. 005) in CGHD and NCGHD than in the other groups. In comparison to basal levels, IGF-I values increased (0. 005 < p < 0. 05) both 48 and 96 h after the start of the hCG test in short idiopathic and normal stature children and in GH-treated subjects with NCGHD, but only 96 h in subjects with untreated NCGHD and GH-treated CGHD. No difference was demonstrated in basal values of total testosterone among any of the groups, while basal free testosterone levels were higher (0. 001 < p < 0. 05) in GH-treated subjects with NCGHD than in all the other groups except nutritional obesity: furthermore, free testosterone was higher ip < 0. 05) in nutritional obesity than in CGHD, The values of total and free testosterone obtained both 48 and 96 h after the start of the hCG test were higher (0. 001 < p < 0. 05) than basal values in all groups. The DHEAS values did not show any significant change during the hCG test. Basal values were higher (0. 01 < p < 0. 05) in nutritional obesity than in the other groups. Considering all groups, chonological age, bone age and bone age/chronological age ratio were correlated with basal free testosterone, IGF-I and DHEAS levels (0. 001 < p < 0. 05). while basal free testosterone and IGF-I values were correlated with DHEAS levels (p < 0. 005 and < 0. 01, respectively), In conclusion, our study during the hCG test in boys with various clinical conditions demonstrated an increase in IGF-I concentrations only in those boys with sufficient GH secretion or GH replacement therapy, These findings indicate that both sex steroids and GH are necessary to allow for the pubertal increase in IGF-I levels...|$|R
