5|$|In October 2009, Hasselbaink {{trained with}} Conference South side Woking to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> himself fit {{and do some}} {{coaching}}. He then worked with Chelsea's under-16 squad and coached at the Nike Academy while taking his UEFA 'B' and 'A' licences. From July 2011 to January 2013 {{he was a member}} of the coaching staff at Nottingham Forest, leaving the club when manager Sean O'Driscoll was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|Sounds and {{gestures}} <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> track of other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).|$|E

5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens. However, their {{resolution is}} considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> their price reasonable and to maintain a preferable response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.|$|E
5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made {{it much more difficult}} to run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> in shape. As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E

5|$|Danzig was saved, but {{the next}} year the {{strengthened}} in the Ducal Prussia Swedish army took Brodnica, and early in 1629 defeated the Polish units at Górzno. Gustavus Adolphus from his Baltic coast position laid an economic siege against the Commonwealth and ravaged what he had conquered. At this point allied forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein were brought in to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the Swedes in check. Forced by the combined Polish-Austrian action Gustavus had to withdraw from Kwidzyn to Malbork, in process being defeated and almost taken prisoner by Koniecpolski at the Battle of Trzciana.|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires {{plenty of food}} energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E
5|$|The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a {{radius of}} 2.5AU inward, {{appears to be}} clear of dust down to the {{detection}} limit of the 6.5m MMT telescope. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while {{the presence of a}} planetary system may also <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|To <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens {{are made of}} Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making {{the building}} appear oversized. Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas {{was used in the}} board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E

5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the banks afloat during {{the financial crisis}} in 2008, {{and as a result}} the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Resident Evil 3 was released, {{development}} on Code: Veronica was nearing completion. Much of Code: Veronicas 70-person development staff was outsourced because Capcom resources had been tied up working on Resident Evil 3. Shinji Mikami and Yoshiki Okamoto's team at Flagship oversaw the game's scenario and direction, while XAX Entertainment assisted with environments and Nextech handled {{much of the}} technical development. Capcom Production Studio 4 still handled art direction and character design. By September 1999, Sega was sending some of its own developers to help add final touches to the game. Sega assisted Capcom with the game's programming to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> a good framerate.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
5|$|Robert DeLeo, against Atlantic Records' wishes, {{insisted that}} he and his brother Dean DeLeo produce the record themselves, which began {{production}} in early 2009. Because recording took place during breaks in the band's touring schedule, production took nearly ten months to complete. Three studios were used simultaneously, including Robert's home studio and Eric Kretz's Bomb Shelter Studios. Scott Weiland recorded vocals at his own Lavish Studios. Don Was was brought in as an additional producer to <b>help</b> <b>keep</b> the band's separate recording sessions in sync, as well as to work closely with Weiland during the recording of his vocals. The album was completed in December 2009, and mixing and mastering were finished by February 2010.|$|E
