25|$|JR begins {{drinking}} {{again and}} slips into depression. He is, however, {{able to recover}} from the relapse and reconcile with Babe. Months later, he and Babe are closer again, and are more about raising their son together while not being romantically intertwined with each other. But during a snowday with Babe and Little Adam, JR suggests to Babe that she keep the idea of them as lovers open for consideration. Having enjoyed her recent time with JR, Babe accepts his request. Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, Annie, is thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that Annie is not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress. Once she gets his attention, she propositions him with a game of strip poker. If she wins, he will have to save Richie's life. If JR wins, he can have anything he wants in regards to her. The deal is made, and JR and Babe play for the prize at Babe's home. Both half naked by the time the game nears an end, it is JR who wins. But he surprises Babe with the news that he already knew he was a match for Richie, and that he was already <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him.</b> Babe is intrigued by this new, softer side of JR, and JR mentions to Babe how they both want each other. They embrace, and the two make love.|$|E

She chases the Snow Queen (Elizabeth Mitchell) and demands to know why she is being followed, but the Snow Queen vanishes.

50|$|Set {{six years}} after the series finale of The Real Ghostbusters, Janine had bounced from various jobs since the Ghostbusters closed down in 1991. Having been {{recently}} downsized from her last job she returned to school at the New York City College and amongst the various (and unmentioned) courses she was taking was a paranormal one, where she was reunited with Egon, <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> form the new team.|$|R
6000|$|The {{pleasure}} I felt at {{this announcement}} was not unmixed, but I {{tried to keep}} Mrs. Makely from thinking so, and I was immensely relieved when she found {{a chance to say}} to me, in a low voice: [...] "I know just how you're feeling, Mr. Twelvemough, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you keep <b>him</b> from doing anything ridiculous, if I can. I like him, and I think it's a perfect shame to have people laughing at him. I know we can manage him between us." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{had been}} savage, then sullen, {{and now he}} was grim. Madeline all but lost power to resist his strange, deadly, cold finality. No doubt he knew he was doomed. Yet {{something}} halted her--held her even as she took a backward step. And she became conscious of a subtle change in her own feeling. She had come into that squalid hole, Madeline Hammond, earnest enough, kind enough in her own intentions; but she had been almost imperious--a woman habitually, proudly used to being obeyed. She divined that all the pride, blue blood, wealth, culture, distinction, all the impersonal condescending persuasion, all the fatuous philanthropy on earth would not avail to turn this man a single hair's-breadth from his downward career to destruction. Her coming had terribly augmented his bitter hate of himself. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fail <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him.</b> She experienced a sensation of impotence that amounted almost to distress. The situation assumed a tragic keenness. She had set forth to reverse the tide of a wild cowboy's fortunes; she faced the swift wasting of his life, the damnation of his soul. The subtle consciousness of change in her was the birth of that faith she had revered in Stillwell. And all at once she became merely a woman, brave and sweet and indomitable.|$|R
6000|$|Putney amused {{himself in}} speculating on these lines with {{more or less}} {{reference}} to Mr. Peck, and did not notice that the doctor and Annie gave him only a silent assent.

They are <b>going</b> with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> set up a sort of cooperative boarding-house. Well, I don't know where we shall get a hotter gospeller than Brother Peck. Poor old fellow! I hope he'll get along better in Fall River. It {{is something to be}} out of reach of Gerrish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hark!' said Miss Charity, {{holding up}} her finger, as a gentle rap was heard {{at the street}} door. 'There is the creature!

Only mark my words, if that isn't his intention!' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took me by}} the arm, {{and walked}} me away with him along the road by which he had come. I dare say I had {{deserved}} his reproof--but I was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> to set traps for Rosanna Spearman, for all that. Thief or no thief, legal or not legal, I don't care--I pitied her.|$|E

50|$|Late in {{the summer}} of that same year Jim tells Pony Baker and the boys that he knows of a {{watermelon}} patch that the owner had no use for, and the other boys demand to know where it is. Jim tells them that the patch belongs to Bunty Williams and he dares the boys to come with him to get melons. The boys set off with Jim to the watermelon patch on a sunny morning in September. On their trip through the river and the woods, Jim begins to hesitate and act as though {{he does not want to}} show the boys where the watermelon patch is. The boys encourage him <b>to</b> keep <b>going</b> and offer <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> get there when he begins to complain of a toothache. Finally, Jim rushes ahead of the boys to the patch that is about the size of an acre. The boys begin to praise Jim for leading them to the patch, but he does not participate in eating the melons and looks on while complaining of a toothache. While the boys break open the melons, Pony does not take any of them. For some reason, Pony thinks it looks wrong to take and eat them from the patch. So, Pony stands off to the side and Jim stands there with him while they watch the rest of the boys enjoy themselves.|$|R
50|$|While this {{is going}} on, Robert learns that Chrissie has begun a {{relationship}} with his brother Andy. This riles Robert, but also irritates Aaron as Robert's attentions are elsewhere, when he needs him the most. A week later, Aaron told Robert don't go to court but Robert went {{the next day when}} he is taking on the stand. Robert insists Aaron wouldn't lie about something of this magnitude and admits to court that his feelings to Aaron.

60|$|For {{an instant}} Dick's soul demurred. If he told Olive {{anything}} {{he would tell}} her all he knew, and exactly what had happened. But he would not lose faith in this noble woman who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> with Olive if she could. So they sat down, side by side, {{and he told her}} everything he knew about Captain Asher and Miss Port.|$|E

I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him.</b> I'm going to do it, not only to obtain justice for him, but to assist in detecting and punishing the true murderer." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What is the good," [...] said Ashe, [...] "of {{traveling}} fast if you're going {{round in}} a circle? I {{know how you}} feel. I've felt the same myself. You are an individualist. You think there is something tremendous just round the corner and {{that you can get}} it if you try hard enough. There isn't--or if there is it isn't worth getting. Life is nothing but a mutual aid association. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> old Peters--you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me--I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, me and Huck Finn here, we {{come down}} on the boat with the thieves, and the dead one told us all about the di'monds, and said the others would murder him if they got the chance; and we was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> all we could. We was bound for the sycamores when we heard them killing him in there; but we was in there in the early morning after the storm and allowed nobody hadn't been killed, after all.

60|$|We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him.</b> We {{have had}} misgivings {{ever since we}} found {{his name in the}} title, and we shall keep him out of his rights as long as we can. Even though we {{softened}} to him he would not be a hero in these clothes of servitude; and he loves his clothes. How {{to get him out of}} them? It would require a cataclysm. To be an indoor servant at all is to Crichton a badge of honour; to be a butler at thirty is the realisation of his proudest ambitions. He is devotedly attached to his master, who, in his opinion, has but one fault, he is not sufficiently contemptuous of his inferiors. We are immediately to be introduced to this solitary failing of a great English peer.|$|E
60|$|But {{all that}} was in the past, and {{thinking}} about it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> now. He had got to do something right away. Perhaps he might find a place to live in the old stone wall, and there might, there just might, be enough grains of corn scattered over the ground of the cornfield for him to lay up a supply, if he worked very hard and fast. Anyway, he would have a look. So he hurried down from the tree and out along the old stone wall. His spirits began to rise as he whisked along, peering into every hole and jumping from stone to stone. It really seemed as though he might find a snug home somewhere here. Then he remembered something that made his heart sink again. He remembered having seen Shadow the Weasel more than once exploring that very wall. Just as likely as not he would do it again, for it was so very near the Green Forest. No, the old stone wall wouldn't do.|$|E
