6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{have done}} so; {{so many that}} we English novelists may boast as a class {{that has been the}} general result of our own work. Looking back to the past generation, I may say with {{certainty}} that such was the operation of the novels of Miss Edgeworth, Miss Austen, and Walter Scott. Coming down to my own times, I find such to have been the teaching of Thackeray, of Dickens, and of George Eliot. Speaking, as I shall speak to any who may read these words, with that absence of self-personality which the dead may claim, I will boast that such has been the result of my own writing. Can any one by search through the works of the six great English novelists I have named, find a scene, a passage, or a word that would teach a girl to be immodest, or a man to be dishonest? When men in their pages have been described as dishonest and women as immodest, have they not ever been punished? It is not for the novelist to say, baldly and simply: [...] "Because you lied here, or were heartless there, because you Lydia Bennet forgot the lessons of your honest home, or you Earl Leicester were false through your ambition, or you Beatrix loved too well the glitter of the world, therefore you shall be scourged with scourges either in this world or in the next;" [...] but it is for him to show, as he carries on his tale, that his Lydia, or his Leicester, or his Beatrix, will be dishonoured in the estimation of all readers by his or her vices. Let a woman be drawn clever, beautiful, attractive,--so as to make men love her, and women almost envy her,--and let her be made also heartless, unfeminine, and ambitious of evil grandeur, as was Beatrix, what a danger is there not in such a character! To the novelist who shall handle it, what peril of doing harm! But if at last it have been so handled that every girl who reads of Beatrix shall say: [...] "Oh! not like that;--let me not be like that!" [...] and that every youth shall say: [...] "Let me not have such a one as that to press my bosom, anything rather than that!"--then will not the novelist have preached his sermon as perhaps no clergyman can preach it? ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{that popular}} humor {{which is the}} medium we float in, if I can discern {{anything}} at all of its present state, it is far worse than I have ever known or could ever imagine it. The faults {{of the people are}} not popular vices; at least, they are not such as grow out of what we used to take to be the English temper and character. The greatest number have a sort of an heavy, lumpish acquiescence in government, without much respect or esteem for those that compose it. I really cannot avoid making some very unpleasant prognostics from this disposition of the people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the symptoms must have struck you: I will mention one or two that are to me very remarkable. You must know that at Bristol we grow, as an election interest, and even as a party interest, rather stronger than we were when I was chosen. We have just now a majority in the corporation. In this state of matters, what, think you, have they done? They have voted their freedom to Lord Sandwich and Lord Suffolk!--to the first, at the very moment when the American privateers were domineering in the Irish Sea, and taking the Bristol traders in the Bristol Channel;--to the latter, when his remonstrances on the subject of captures were the jest of Paris and of Europe. This fine step was taken, it seems, in honor of the zeal of these two profound statesmen in the prosecution of John the Painter: so totally negligent are they of everything essential, and so long and so deeply affected with trash the most low and contemptible; just as if they thought the merit of Sir John Fielding was the most shining point in the character of great ministers, in the most critical of all times, and, of all others, the most deeply interesting to the commercial world! My best friends in the corporation had no other doubts on the occasion than whether it did not belong to me, by right of my representative capacity, to be the bearer of this auspicious compliment. In addition to this, if it could receive any addition, they now employ me to solicit, as a favor of no small magnitude, that, after the example of Newcastle, they may be suffered to arm vessels for their own defence in the Channel. Their memorial, under the seal of Merchants' Hall, is now lying on the table before me. Not a soul has the least sensibility, on finding themselves, now for the first time, obliged to act as if the community were dissolved, and, after enormous payments towards the common protection, each part was to defend itself, {{as if it were a}} separate state.|$|E

60|$|But {{unfortunately}} {{the gift of}} an altar to St Fabricius was such a godsend that sundry priests about the country were determined to cling to the good man who had bestowed his money so well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of them did {{believe that this was}} a great sign of a beauteous stirring of people's minds in favour of Rome. The fervent Romanists have always this point in their favour, that they are ready to believe. And they have a desire for the conversion of men which is honest in an exactly inverse ratio to the dishonesty of the means which they employ to produce it. Father Barham was ready to sacrifice anything personal to himself in the good cause,--his time, his health, his money when he had any, and his life. Much as he liked the comfort of Carbury Hall, he would never for a moment condescend to ensure its continued enjoyment by reticence as to his religion. Roger Carbury was hard of heart. He could see that. But the dropping of water might hollow the stone. If the dropping should be put an end to by outward circumstances before the stone had been impressed that would not be his fault. He at any rate would do his duty. In that fixed resolution Father Barham was admirable. But he had no scruple whatsoever as {{to the nature of the}} arguments he would use,--or as to the facts which he would proclaim. With the mingled ignorance of his life and the positiveness of his faith he had at once made up his mind that Melmotte was a great man, and that he might be made a great instrument on behalf of the Pope. He believed in the enormous proportions of the man's wealth,--believed that he was powerful in all quarters of the globe,--and believed, because he was so told by 'The Surplice,' that the man was at heart a Catholic. That a man should be at heart a Catholic, and live in the world professing the Protestant religion, was not to Father Barham either improbable or distressing. Kings who had done so were to him objects of veneration. By such subterfuges and falsehood of life had they been best able to keep alive the spark of heavenly fire. There was a mystery and religious intrigue in this which recommended itself to the young priest's mind. But it was clear to him that this was a peculiar time,--in which it behoved an earnest man to be doing something. He had for some weeks been preparing himself for a trip to London in order that he might spend a week in retreat with kindred souls who from time to time betook themselves to the cells of St Fabricius. And so, just at this season of the Westminster election, Father Barham made a journey to London.|$|E

[...] While this does not mean his works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.|$|E
5000|$|Black {{considers}} Celebrate the Bullet {{to be one}} of the band's best albums, and to {{be superior}} to its predecessor. Speaking to Exclusive Magazine in 2016, she said: [...] "Celebrate the Bullet was in my opinion, musically a much better album than Too Much Pressure, but unfortunately the release coincided with the gun murder of John Lennon and the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. UK Radio did not want to play the title single and without radio-play, no record gets a particularly fair hearing. Given the fullness of time, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> present day Selecter fans see that piece of work as a much fuller representation of The Selecter than Too Much Pressure. [...] "Celebrate the Bullet" [...] remains a highlight for me in the Selecter canon. I can’t think of a better song that has been written about the futility of gun violence than that." [...] In her book Black by Design: A 2-Tone Memoir, Black said [...] "I think Celebrate the Bullet is a forgotten classic of 2-Tone, on par with 'Ghost Town' in terms of orchestration and arrangement, but with a more oblique message. It was an own goal for Noel Davies. Without a hit single, both the British tour and sales of the album were in jeopardy. Noel had told us to prepare for success. Now we silently stared into the abyss while arguably making the best album of our careers. I stand by Celebrate the Bullet wholeheartedly. It is a proud album by a proud band. We were rowing against the tide and ultimately were swamped in the mighty swell of the '80s pop market. There was no place for us in the musical world anymore." ...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I shall {{examine the}} {{question}} of physicalism through two papers criticising the formulation of the doctrine. In the first chapter, I discuss Tim Carne's and D. H. Mellor's influential (1990) There Is No Question of Physicalism, in which they argue {{that there are no}} real criteria by which the science of psychology can be separated from the paradigmatically physical sciences, and so no principled reason to suppose that the predicates of pyschology do not describe real elements of the world's ontology whereas those of physics do. I shall explain why I find their arguments unconvincing, and to show how some of the reasons they consider not to support the noncontinuity of psychology with physics actually can support the distinction. Crane and Mellor take physicalism to be an epistemological doctrine, according to which the empirical world "contains just what a true and complete physical science would say it contains". Physicalism can, however, be taken as a metaphysical doctrine, and indeed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> modern physicalists do take it this way. In his (1998) What Are Physical Properties?, Chris Daly argues that no principled distinction can be drawn between physical and nonphysical properties, and that therefore any metaphysical programme which assumes such a distinction is misguided. I shall agree with much of his reasoning, but not with his 'downbeat' conclusion: while I agree that there are serious difficulties involved in setting constraints on the bounds of the physical, I think that enough can positively be said to make physicalism a meaningful position. Between the two papers, a fairly broad survey of some recent accounts of physicalism is made and these two distinct avenues explored: physicalism construed as a doctrine about science, and physicalism as a doctrine attempting to limit the contents of the world a priori through a definition of {{what it is to be}} a physical properties. All in all, I think that there is much to learn from these two papers, but not all of it is as negative, conclusive, or 'downbeat' as their authors might have intended. Rather, I think that some new directions are indicated by the failure of some of the avenues they explore...|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> smart people, {{particularly}} on the Left, make a really ill-considered assumption, to wit, that 2 ̆ 2 Republican 2 ̆ 2 means 2 ̆ 2 Conservative. 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t mean lower case 2 ̆ 2 c 2 ̆ 2 conservative, as in wanting {{to maintain the status}} quo. Nearly all (there are important exceptions) twentieth-century Republicans were conservatives in that generic sense. Rather, I mean capital 2 ̆ 2 c 2 ̆ 2 conservative, that is, pro-religion, traditional family centered, militarily hawkish, arch-patriotic, Constitution protecting, States rights shielding, free enterprise loving, individual responsibility promoting, values matter Conservative. It was only in the 1980 s that a goodly number of Republicans endorsed this set of beliefs. In his wonderfully written, witty, and engaging book The Rise and Fall of Modern American Conservatism (Princeton UP, 2010), David Farber tells the story of how Conservatives took over the Republican Party and reshaped American politics. He does so using a devise that I find particularly appropriate for any story of political change, namely, through {{the lives of the people}} who founded, grew, and led the movement. Farber, who clearly believes that leadership matters a great deal in democratic politics (I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t agree more), has a talent for linking biography to political history. His sketches of Robert Taft, William Buckley, Barry Goldwater, Phyllis Schlafly, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush show us the degree to which their personalities shaped the rise (and fall) of American Conservatism. Each vignette is a pleasure to read and full of enlightening and entertaining observations. And though Farber pulls no punches (he does not shrink, for example, from calling a liar a liar), it 2 ̆ 7 s clear that he respects his subjects and suggests that we should respect them too.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this essay is first to get a general idea {{about a group of}} working {{teachers}} thoughts of mathematics and the teaching in mathematics. I also would like {{to find out what they}} think affect pupils relationship to the subject. The surveys main purpose is to compare teachers in grade 4 - 6 and teachers in grade 7 - 9 view of what you as a teacher can do to further the learning in mathematics. I have done eight interviews. Four of them are with teachers in grade 4 - 6 and the other four interviews are with teachers in grade 7 - 9. Concerning the result of my examination it is difficult to come to a general conclusion. It is also difficult to generalise the answers I got but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> teachers can know in oneself minds and valuations about mathematics and how the subject could be teach. I would also like to declare that the conclusion I have made only concerns my respondents, which means that they not can be compared with another or bigger selection group. The result of my examination have shown that the views of what you can do as a teacher to further pupils learning in mathematics are separated in some ways. Both groups think that the variation in teaching is central for the motivation of learning. The respondents that teach in grade 4 - 6 say that it is important for the pupils to see the meaning of mathematics in ordinary situations. The teachers in grade 7 - 9 mean that it is central to build up the pupils self-confidence and their trust in themselves in the subject of mathematics. Nowadays it is the textbooks that roles the teaching in all grades. All respondents say that it is also important to work without the textbook. The turn-over in the practice are different. According to the teachers the pupils relationship to mathematics are both positive and negative. The respondents that teach in grade 4 - 6 say that their pupils motivation lack when the formal and abstract thinking is introduced. The respondents that teach in grade 7 - 9 think that the pupils meanings differs but the lack of motivation shows when their pupils begin in grade 7. My personal opinion about the subject is that to many pupils create a negative attitude to mathematics in early stages of life. As a future teacher my question is how you should form your teaching to further the pupils learning and interests in mathematics...|$|E
