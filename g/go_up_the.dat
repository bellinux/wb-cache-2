Some communities isolated by floodwaters experienced food shortages, and a rise in the cost of fruits and vegetables was reported shortly after. Food supplies to northern Queensland were disrupted requiring groceries to be transported to Townsville by ship.|$|E

25|$|Tiresias {{appears as}} {{the name of a}} {{recurring}} character in several stories and Greek tragedies concerning the legendary history of Thebes. In The Bacchae, by Euripides, Tiresias appears with Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes, to warn the current king Pentheus against denouncing Dionysus as a god. Along with Cadmus, he dresses as a worshiper of Dionysus to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain to honor the new god with the Theban women in their Bacchic revels.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Porter {{started an}} effort on March 14 to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Yazoo Delta via Steele's Bayou, {{just north of}} Vicksburg, to Deer Creek. This would outflank Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and Yazoo City. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats' paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and {{infantry}} threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter's approach was abandoned as too difficult.|$|E
25|$|There was an upsurge of hunting, fishing, harvesting, {{and other}} {{traditional}} practices which {{had fallen into}} disuse during colonisation. Men would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> cliffs hunting black noddy, a local small bird, while women were collecting sea food in the reefs; everyone was fishing as much as possible. Nauruan women produced twine, made of coconut tree fiber, which was used for construction in lieu of nails, {{as well as for}} canoe making and fishing. From pandanus leaves, they made a strong fabric used for mats, baskets, shelter-pieces, and sails.|$|E

25|$|Spanish level {{crossings}} (paso a nivel in Spanish) have two alternating red lights {{and sometimes a}} pedestrian light {{on the other side}} of the crossing. When activated, the lights flash, the bells ring and the barriers lower, as the crossing is usually automatic. More rarely, once the barriers have fully lowered, the sound changes. For some {{level crossings}}, when the barriers begin to <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> square light stops flashing. More often, the level crossings in Spain, unlike all other level crossings, activate a long time before the train arrives.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August 1814, Vice-Admiral Alexander Cochrane {{detached}} Devastation, Euryalus, Ætna, Meteor, Manly and Erebus, {{all under}} Captain Alexander Gordon in Seahorse, to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Potomac and bombard Fort Washington, {{which was on}} the left bank of the river, some ten or twelve miles below Washington itself. The British suffered from several disadvantages. First, they lacked pilots that knew the Kettle-Bottoms, a difficult stretch of the river. Second, the winds blew in the wrong direction, slowing their advance. Consequently, it took them ten days to reach the fort, and during the journey all the ships grounded at least 20 times. For five successive days they had to warp over a distance of 50 miles.|$|E

Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E
500|$|Shirley {{had engaged}} in the Louisbourg {{campaign}} primarily {{as a way to}} ensure British interests in the Atlantic fisheries. [...] The victory, however, made him expand his vision to encompass the possibility of capturing all of New France. [...] After capturing the French fort he wrote to Newcastle, proposing a series of expeditions to gain control of all of North America as far west as the Mississippi River, starting with one that would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Saint Lawrence from Louisbourg. [...] Upon his return to Boston, Shirley began making preparations for such an expedition. [...] In May 1746 he received plans for London outlining an attempt on Quebec using Royal Navy and provincial forces, while a second expedition was to attack Fort Saint-Frédéric on Lake Champlain. [...] Shirley stepped up recruiting in Massachusetts and asked neighboring governors to contribute men and resources to the effort. [...] Expected support from Britain never arrived, however, and the 1746 expeditions were called off.|$|E

500|$|Early in April, Philip Schuyler had {{approached}} Arnold {{with the possibility}} of giving him the command at West Point. Discussions had not borne fruit between Schuyler and Washington by early June. Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British, informing them of Schuyler's proposals and including Schuyler's assessment of conditions at West Point. He also provided information on a proposed French-American invasion of Quebec that was to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut River (Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources). On June 16, Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business, and he sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel. When he reached Connecticut, Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York. By early July, he was back in Philadelphia, where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a [...] "drawing of the works ... by which you might take [...] without loss".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} record of Omaha reports that [...] "...the tanks were leading a hard life...". According to {{the commander of the}} 2nd battalion 116th RCT the tanks [...] "...saved the day. They shot {{the hell out of the}} Germans, and got the hell shot out of them." [...] As the morning progressed the beach defenses were gradually being reduced, often by tanks. Scattered along the length of the beach, trapped between the sea and the impassable shingle embankment and with no operating radios amongst the commanders, tanks had to be controlled individually. This was perilous work. The commanding officer of the 111th Field Artillery, who had landed ahead of his unit, was killed as he tried to direct the fire of one tank. The command group of the 741st tank battalion lost three out their group of five in their efforts. Additionally, the commander of the 743rd tank battalion became a casualty as he approached one of his tanks with orders. When naval gunfire was brought to bear against the strong-points defending the E-3 draw, a decision was made to try to force this exit with tanks. Colonel Taylor ordered all available tanks into action against this point at 11:00. Only three were able to reach the rallying point, and two were knocked out as they attempted to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> draw, forcing the remaining tank to back off.|$|E
