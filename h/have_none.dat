5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father would <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of it.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} {{close to}} Dudley and he, with her blessing {{and on her}} prompting, pursued his suit for her hand {{in an atmosphere of}} diplomatic intrigue. His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, in the spring of 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of that and everything remained as it was.|$|E
5|$|Marion County, the {{location}} of the state capital Indianapolis, has the most NHLs, with ten, followed by Bartholomew County with seven and Jefferson County with four. Twenty counties have one, while the other 69 counties of Indiana <b>have</b> <b>none.</b> Indiana's first NHL was designated on October 9, 1960. Architects who designed multiple Indiana NHLs are Francis Costigan, William Dentzel, and Eero Saarinen.|$|E

5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} {{one of a few}} chicken breeds in which the roosters are hen feathered, meaning they <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism in the study of sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively <b>have</b> <b>none</b> and two complete serials between them, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E

China Miéville {{has won three}} times, while Pat Cadigan and Geoff Ryman have won twice; no other author has won {{multiple}} times. Stephen Baxter and Gwyneth Jones have the most nominations at seven, and Baxter has the most nominations without winning. Neal Stephenson has won once out of six nominations; Ken MacLeod and Kim Stanley Robinson have also been nominated six times. Paul J.

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours. Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours, {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest neighbours (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, <b>have</b> <b>none.</b> This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{franchise}} {{includes several}} spin-off games, including the Dragon Quest Monsters RPG. The series has also inspired arcade games {{such as the}} Japanese , where players compete for real-life cards with monster data that the arcade game issues to the players through a slot on its front. The latter is the only spin-off series to <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of its titles released outside Japan. The Mystery Dungeon and Fortune Street series use characters and other elements from Dragon Quest games, and the Mystery Dungeon series {{has gone on to}} spawn its own franchise.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men would <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of it and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will <b>have</b> <b>none</b> but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E
5|$|Princess Anne (1971) and her {{daughter}} Zara Phillips (2006) are the only award-winners {{to be members of}} the same family. The oldest recipient of the award is Dai Rees, who won in 1957 aged 44. Ian Black, who won the following year, aged 17, is the youngest winner. Torvill and Dean, who won in 1984, are the only non-individual winners of the award, so in the 61 years of the award there have been 62 recipients. Of these 13 have been female. 17 sporting disciplines have been represented; athletics has the highest representation, with 17 recipients. Counting Torvill and Dean separately, there have been 48 English winners of the award, six Scottish, four Welsh, three Northern Irish, and one Manx. Since the award ceremony began only on one occasion (2013) <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of the podium placers been English. On three occasions a sportsman from outside the United Kingdom has made the podium, on each occasion for sporting success achieved in Great Britain; New Zealand speedway star Barry Briggs (1964 and 1966) and Italian jockey Frankie Dettori (1996). Barry McGuigan, Greg Rusedski and Lennox Lewis originally competed for Ireland (McGuigan) and Canada (Rusedski and Lewis) respectively, but had completed their transfer of allegiance to Great Britain by the time of their awards.|$|E

5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others <b>have</b> <b>none,</b> and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of that thunder which appals, or that resistless {{and winning}} {{softness}} which melts, {{the hearts of}} an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would <b>have</b> <b>none</b> of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E
