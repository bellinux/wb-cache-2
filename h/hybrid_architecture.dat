5|$|Titan is {{available}} for any scientific purpose; access depends {{on the importance of}} the project and its potential to exploit the <b>hybrid</b> <b>architecture.</b> Any selected programs must also be executable on other supercomputers to avoid sole dependence on Titan. Six vanguard programs were the first selected. They dealt mostly with molecular scale physics or climate models, while 25 others were queued behind them. The inclusion of GPUs compelled authors to alter their programs. The modifications typically increased the degree of parallelism, given that GPUs offer many more simultaneous threads than CPUs. The changes often yield greater performance even on CPU-only machines.|$|E
5|$|VERA is a {{light water}} reactor {{simulation}} written at the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers to monitor the performance and status of any part of a reactor core throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although {{not one of the}} first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. Computer scientist Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's <b>hybrid</b> <b>architecture</b> was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we outline hybrid {{approaches}} to arti cial neural network-based natural language processing. We start by motivating hybrid symbolic/connectionist processing.

40|$|<b>Hybrid</b> analog/digital MIMO <b>architectures</b> were {{recently}} proposed {{as an alternative}} for fully-digitalprecoding in millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communication systems. This is motivated by the possible {{reduction in the number}} of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters. In these architectures, the analog processing network is usually based on variable phase shifters. In this paper, we propose <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> based on switching networks to reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we propose an open loop compressive channel estimation technique which is independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the performance of the new estimation algorithm for <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> based on phase shifters and switches. Using the estimated, we develop two algorithms for the design of the hybrid combiner based on switches and analyze the achieved spectral efficiency. Finally, we study the trade-offs between power consumption, hardware complexity, and spectral efficiency for <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> based on phase shifting networks and switching networks. Numerical results show that architectures based on switches obtain equal or better channel estimation performance to that obtained using phase shifters, while reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. For equal power consumption, all the <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> provide similar spectral efficiencies. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Acces...|$|R

25|$|Unlike the K computer, the Tianhe-1A {{system uses}} a <b>hybrid</b> <b>architecture</b> and {{integrates}} CPUs and GPUs. It uses more than 14,000 Xeon general-purpose processors {{and more than}} 7,000 Nvidia Tesla general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) on about 3,500 blades.

Tianhe-1 uses a proprietary high-speed communication network to connect the processors.

25|$|Within {{six months}} of coming into ownership, the King began his own {{rebuilding}} and expansion. Henry VIII's court consisted of over one thousand people, while the King owned over sixty houses and palaces. Few of these were {{large enough to hold}} the assembled court, and thus one of the first of the King's building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide bouche of court for his entire court. The architecture of King Henry's new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This <b>hybrid</b> <b>architecture</b> was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until Inigo Jones introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.|$|E

25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} {{transmit power}} to their drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of parallel <b>hybrid</b> <b>architecture.</b> Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Carbon nanotubes' (CNTs) superlative {{combination}} of electrical, thermal, and especially mechanical properties make them ideal candidates for composite reinforcement. Nanocomposites and <b>hybrid</b> composite <b>architectures</b> employing traditional advanced composites and CNTs offer significant potential mechanical and multifunctional performance benefits. CNT/polymer composites and two different <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> are experimentally investigated in this work. A novel process for rapidly growing dense, long, high-quality aligned CNT forests is employed. The first architecture {{is comprised of}} aligned fibers with CNTs grown radially on their surface. For the second architecture, dense forests of vertically aligned CNTs are placed between the plies of a laminate, in the through-thickness direction. Fundamental issues related to realizing <b>hybrid</b> composite <b>architectures</b> are investigated experimentally: wetting of the CNTs by commercially available polymers for the different architectures, effective reinforcement of the polymer matrices due to the addition of CNTs, and retention of mechanical (stiffness and strength) properties of the fibers after the CNT growth process. (cont.) Wetting of CNT forests by several commercial polymers (including a highly-viscous epoxy) is demonstrated at rates conducive to creating a fully-dispersed CNT/matrix region for the two <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> previously described. Direct measurements of the mechanical properties of nanocomposites are reported {{for the first time}} in the literature. Increases in the Young's modulus of the polymer as high as 220 % with just 2 % volume fraction of aligned CNTs are observed. Equivalent reinforcement had been obtained previously by other authors with 5 % volume fraction of randomly oriented CNTs. Single-fiber tension tests indicate no mechanical degradation (stiffness and strength) for alumina fibers undergoing the CNT growth process. Preliminary results on the fabrication of the two <b>hybrid</b> <b>architectures</b> are also presented.
