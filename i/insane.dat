5|$|All {{surviving}} sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as <b>insane.</b> However, it is {{not known}} whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was <b>insane</b> (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E
5|$|Balinor {{returns to}} Tyrsis to {{activate}} the Border Legion {{only to find that}} it has been disbanded.

5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the <b>insane</b> person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found <b>insane.</b>|$|E
5|$|Macrinus now {{sent letters}} to the Senate denouncing Elagabalus as the False Antoninus and {{claiming}} he was <b>insane.</b> Both consuls and other high-ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned Elagabalus, and the Senate subsequently declared war on both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.|$|E

5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was <b>insane,</b> but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him {{to think he was}} a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him <b>insane.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Brothers {{appeared}} for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW), in the ECW arena, on March 24, 2001 at March Madness Night 2, {{losing to}} <b>Insane</b> Dragon and Dixie in the opener. It is unclear how, if at all, JAPW's {{ownership and management}} worked around Pennsylvania's child labor law, as both brothers were underage {{at the time of}} this and two subsequent appearances in the old ECW arena. They made three other appearances in JAPW in 2001, all against <b>Insane</b> Dragon & Dixie – one a victory, one that ended in a no contest due to outside interference, and the last an unsuccessful challenge for Dragon and Dixie's JAPW Tag Team Championship on June 15 at Here to Stay.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{features}} the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) being {{captured by the}} Daleks, along with his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who are about to divorce.

5|$|They {{were met}} by nearly 400 <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse fans {{standing}} outside {{in front of the}} TRL studio window, all with signs supporting the duo. Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from the sidewalk. When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show. MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was hand-picked by <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even told his mother to quit her job because he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was <b>insane</b> {{at the time that}} he committed the crime, and where it is claimed that he was <b>insane</b> at the time of the trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|After {{a show in}} Indianapolis, <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse's {{tour bus}} stopped at a Waffle House in Greenfield, Indiana. When a {{customer}} began to harass Spaniolo and Bruce, a fight broke out between the customer {{and all of the}} bands' members. Months later on June 4, 1998, Bruce and Utsler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges (reduced from battery) in an Indiana court and were fined $200 each. Members of Twiztid, Myzery, and Psycho Realm were charged with battery. The group's tour was briefly derailed in January 1998, when their tour bus drifted off a highway and down an embankment, leaving Frank Moreno of Psycho Realm with a concussion. As a result of the accident, <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse postponed two shows scheduled for Cleveland, Ohio, on January 22 and 23, but honored their promise to perform on January 25 and 26. They face a lawsuit over alleged sexual harassment.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} and releasing The Great Milenko, <b>Insane</b> Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album {{within hours of}} its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the Billboard 200. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church. The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died <b>insane,</b> also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Amongst other {{witnesses}} to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is <b>insane.</b> The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|At Danvers State Hospital Southard met Myrtelle Canavan, {{with whom}} he worked and {{published}} in neuropathology {{for the next few}} years. When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the <b>Insane,</b> in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was enough for her to refuse the Pennsylvania offer.|$|E

5|$|Born in California, Kemper had a {{turbulent}} childhood. He moved to Montana with his abusive mother {{at a young}} age before returning to California, where he murdered his paternal grandparents when he was 15. He was subsequently diagnosed by court psychiatrists as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and sentenced to the Atascadero State Hospital as a criminally <b>insane</b> juvenile.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as a ruse, either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously <b>insane</b> and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
