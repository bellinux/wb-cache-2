5000|$|Captain von Beringe, {{together}} with a physician, Dr. Engeland, a Corporal Ehrhardt, and twenty local troops with equipment and native porters left Usumbura in German East Africa on 19 August 1902. Their destination was the Sultan Msinga of Rwanda. They then headed north to the volcanic Virunga Mountains. On 17 October 1902 he shot two large apes that were unknown to science at the time. He sent them to the Natural History Museum Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, where they were examined and documented by Paul Matschie. The species was named <b>Gorilla</b> <b>beringei</b> in his honor, a gorilla species distinct from the previously discovered western gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla"). This new species, commonly called [...] "eastern gorilla", was later determined to consist of two subspecies: the mountain <b>gorilla</b> (<b>Gorilla</b> <b>beringei</b> beringei) and the eastern lowland <b>gorilla</b> (<b>Gorilla</b> <b>beringei</b> graueri).|$|R

The Bwindi mountain gorilla could be a third subspecies, <b>Gorilla</b> <b>beringei</b> bwindi (Sarmiento et al., 1996) although the taxonomic status of the populations is as yet unclear (McNeilage et al., 2001). Sarmiento et al. (1996) list a number of morphological and ecological differences between the gorillas of Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest and the Virunga volcanoes, and insist that Bwindi gorillas {{do not belong to}} G. b. beringei and so should not be called mountain gorillas. Stanford (2001) contests this and suggests that the evidence showing the Bwindi and Virunga gorillas to be taxonomically distinct is not well supported.
