5|$|Although {{the war had}} officially <b>ended,</b> <b>a</b> {{state of}} anarchy and {{lawlessness}} pervaded {{in the first days}} following the demise of Vitellius.

In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was properly installed as Emperor.|$|E
