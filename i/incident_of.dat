5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace <b>Incident</b> <b>of</b> 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{two more}} fire mishaps {{occurred}} in the leather industries in the area, one {{in the month of}} March and the other in June: a total of nine people got injured in these two incidents. Even though fire safety licenses and insurances for the workers of the leather factories were made mandatory after the fire <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> 2006, none of the authorities—the municipal corporation, the services department of the state government, and the police—ensured that these were actually followed by the factories. The local residents claimed that the owner of the factory that was impacted in the fire <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> 2006, now operates from another address of the same area. According to fire brigade officials, the Topsia area along with nearby Tiljala and Tangra forms the most fire-prone area of the city, and that around three to four fires break out every week, though they do not get reported in the media as there is no loss of life.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C.mutica {{have been found in}} Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the sea chests of international shipping.|$|E

5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes <b>incident</b> <b>of</b> 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces {{captured}} three Croatian policemen {{from nearby}} Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes that threatened to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E
