Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{experience}} at Versailles was influential <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> his future outlook, {{yet it was}} not a successful one for him. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's own economy but that of the wider world.|$|E

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> the land that makes up the park today.|$|E
40|$|Nature {{exhibits}} huge diversity <b>in</b> organ <b>shape,</b> and yet all organs {{start as}} small bud-like peripheral outgrowths. Combinations of different {{spatial and temporal}} developmental switches <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> determine final organ <b>shape.</b> <b>In</b> plants <b>shape</b> arises through growth, which is defined by axiality and growth rates. Here I tested three hypotheses for how developmental switches <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> could arise: (1) growth rates alone are altered, (2) axiality alone is altered (3) both growth rates and axiality are altered. Using a multidisciplinary approach I explored which of the hypotheses was true for developmental switches <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> during organ development in two monocot models: early grass leaf development and the Hooded barley mutant. Developmental switches <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> were first volumetrically described using 3 D imaging. Using this framework, computational models were generated to formulate hypotheses which {{could account for the}} switches <b>in</b> <b>shape.</b> Model predictions were then tested using whole-mount immunolocalisation of SISTER OF PINFORMED 1 (SoPIN 1), gene expression, and cell division and shape analyses. Synthetic biology was also used to generate a set of transgenic tools for future testing of the models. I found that a developmental switch <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> during early grass leaf development may arise through alterations in growth rates alone (hypothesis 1). In contrast, ectopic flower and wing formation in Hooded may arise through modulation of growth rates and axiality combined (hypothesis 2). In this case a single gene, BKn 3, triggers the growth change, possibly through directly influencing tissue cell polarity (if axiality is defined by a polarity based axiality system), with differential effects on shape depending on where it is expressed. This suggests that novel developmental switches <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> could evolve due to single gene mutations, and that during evolution, modulation of growth may have been redeployed in different spatial and temporal patterns to trigger novel changes <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> ultimately changing final form...|$|R

5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> the final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects.

Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{has become}} known as a house for art comics, {{translations}} of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little Nipper. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.|$|E

During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
40|$|Size and shape, {{although}} intuitively simple concepts, {{are difficult}} to define mathematically in a biologically meaningful way. Darroch and Mosimann (1985, Biometrika, 72 : 241 - 252) have proposed definitions of size and shape that incorporate the concept of geometric similarity, and have developed principal components of shape and total variability <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> based on these definitions. We adopt these definitions of size and shape. Using a related definition of the principal components of shape, we characterize the dependence on the size variable of the principal components of shape and total variability <b>in</b> <b>shape.</b> We derive the minimum amount of variability <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and the corresponding size variable. The practical implications of these results are explored using data on strongylid eggs; for each of several plausible size variables, we determine the variability <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and the principal components of shape. The amount of variability <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and the principal components of shape are seen {{to be sensitive to}} the choice of size variable...|$|R
