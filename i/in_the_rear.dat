5|$|Meanwhile, late on 13 February, having {{successfully}} regrouped what forces {{he could}} muster at Bergères-lès-Vertus, Blücher had launched {{an attack against}} Marmont's single division, pushing him out of Étoges and advancing as planned towards Champaubert and Fromentières, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of Napoleon's force. However, having read Blücher's intentions, Napoleon had given orders for a concentration of French forces in that very sector.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} crewed by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> seat.

40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{isolated}} from the intestine of Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton) was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water of Poecilia reticulata (Peters), Poecilia sphenops (Valenciennes), Xiphophorus helleri (Heckel) and Xiphophorus maculatus (Gunther) at four different concentrations (5 9 108 cells ml- 1, 5 9 107 cells ml- 1, 5 9 106 cells ml- 1 and 5 9 105 cells ml- 1) {{and its effect on}} fish growth performance and survival, water quality parameters and bacterial population of water were assessed. The results showed that the addition of bacterial cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water resulted <b>in</b> greater survival and a faster growth rate and, hence, greater length and weight increments of the livebearers. The use of a bioaugmentor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water of <b>the</b> livebearing fishes resulted in significantly lower (P. 05) concentrations of dissolved organic matter and total ammonium nitrogen. The counts of motile aeromonads and total coliforms recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water of bioaugmented tanks were also lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control tank. Bioaugmentation between 106 and 108 cells ml- 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water is sufficient in establishing a bioaugmentor and the use of a higher concentration of bacterial cells did not always lead to significantly better results...|$|R

5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed.

The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw).

40|$|Lap and {{shoulder}} belts {{have been required}} in rear outboard positions since 1989. A recent congressional mandate encouraged the requirement of a lap {{and shoulder}} belt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>rear</b> seat position. This study utilized Data from the Partners for Child Passenger Safety study, a large-scale child-focused crash surveillance system, to quantify changes in seating patterns for children in vehicles that already have this feature compared to those which do not and measured the safety benefit associated with the provision of a shoulder belt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>rear</b> seat position. <b>The</b> data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} a shoulder belt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>rear</b> seating position influences seating practices only when there is a single child occupant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Belted children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>rear</b> of vehicles equipped with a lap shoulder belt are at an 81 % reduction in risk of injury than those belted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center <b>rear</b> equipped with a lap only belt.

5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E

40|$|Severe mortalities due to {{luminescent}} vibrios {{occurred in}} pond-cultured Penaeus monodon juveniles particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 45 days of culture.

Results showed that the occurrence of mortalities was preceded by a shift of the bacterial profile of <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water <b>in</b> infected ponds, notably the dominance of luminescent vibrios. Comparison of bacterial load <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> water and water source (river or open sea) showed elevated luminescent Vibrio counts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former at 12 days to 3 weeks after initial entry of water.

40|$|Majority of blue foxes in Finland {{are housed}} in {{traditional}} shed houses. The shed house usually has nontransparent roofs against sunlight. Increasing daylight and intensity of light during spring is {{a key factor in}} stimulating reproduction. Despite of long lasted selection for reproductive success the number of nonreproducing females is however high. Could the explanation for this be that nontransparent roofs serve as a hindrance to the sunlight and therefore affect to the total light intensity. Light intensity was measured from January to May in a traditional shed house with a nontransparent roof. A <b>rearing</b> hall with <b>the</b> 30 % light transpiring roof was used as a reference. Total 50 primiparous blue fox female siblings were randomly allocated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> hall. <b>The</b> blue fox vixens were artificially inseminated. The highest light intensity was detected four weeks earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> hall (Figs 1 and 2). After the light intensity peaked outside it decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house but stayed at high level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> hall. <b>The</b> number of inseminated females was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house (47 vs. 37, P< 0. 001, respectively). This difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of inseminated females is probably due to high light intensity enough for females to reach estrus. <b>The</b> light intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rearing</b> hall resembles <b>the</b> light intensity <b>in</b> a natural environment. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house the light intensity first increased and then decreased. Little is known about sufficient light intensity needed for a good reproduction result in blue foxes. However, practical experience is that 100 lux is the lowest dose of light needed for estrus. Light intensity below 100 lux was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shed house (Fig 2). Blue foxes females are naturally adjusted to increasing daylight hours and light intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring rather than first rapidly increasing and then rapidly decreasing light intensity. It probably would be worthwhile to study whether the light intensity fluctuation correlates to the number of nonreproducing femalesvo...|$|R
