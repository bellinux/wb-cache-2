40|$|Diagnostics {{of disease}} at POC (point of care) has been {{declared}} one of the Grand Challenge by the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation (BMGF). Infectious diseases constitute {{a major cause of}} disease burden and cause more than half a billion Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and millions of deaths each year. They have an especially large effect on children under 5 years of age. We have analyzed data from the GBD 2010 (Global Burden of Disease) project to emphasize the damage caused by infectious diseases, and highlight the opportunity of using diagnostic tools to rapidly identify and treat diseases. To motivate the work of this thesis, we quantify the expected impact of appropriate diagnostic technologies. We have also analyzed the requirements that a diagnostic tool should meet to generate the maximal global impact. We present various existing TPPs (Target Product Profiles) from different organizations and suggest some additions to these existing TPPs. We explain the particular molecular pathology technologies which have the potential to allow deployment of functional products in the developing world for point-of-care pathogen detection, especially in low-resource settings. We perform a detailed analysis on existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems and describe the problems caused with thermal performance and optical interrogation. We list the requirements that disposable cartridges for such instruments should meet and suggest a metal base design with polymer top. After detailed FEA simulations, we demonstrate that the thermal response can be modeled using a one-dimensional (1 D) lumped element system. We show improvements in thermal response due to using a metal base and the effect of fluid height. We also performed thermal-structural simulations to quantify the stresses on the adhesive bonds of metal/polymer cartridges. Next, we explain fabrication of these cartridges. We show methods to dispense adhesive using a robot and a custom made jig to spread the adhesive during curing. The cartridge was tested with different PCR reagents and we obtained reaction efficiencies approaching those of the commercial real time PCR machines. Our fabrication technique is useful to join dissimilar materials and is production friendly. By developing custom software, we observed the cartridge performance in a continuous manner. We could see the thermal response of cartridges by continuous fluorescence monitoring, and used reflective aluminum which increase light collection efficiency. We then present a simple and robust new way for thermal cycling. Robust thermal cycling has been a major challenge conducting PCR, especially in point of care situations. Here, we suggest a contact cooling approach, in which the cartridge rests on a thin metal plate with an integrated thin heater constructed from flexible printed circuit board (PCB) material. We use a solenoid to move a metal plate to cool down the sample cartridge during cycling. The metal plate then rests on a larger heat sink to disperse the shuttled heat. Our design is <b>dust</b> and water <b>proof</b> and was verified on a bench-top prototype. A novel optical design for fluorescence detection during qPCR is also described. We suggest a lateral illumination waveguide geometry with prism coupling that eliminates lenses and is integrated into an injection molded cartridge. The light is homogenized using a light guide, and we quantify the sources of scattered stray light from the chamber edge by performing ray tracing simulations to optimize the precise geometry. The design is tolerant to misalignments and enables easy coupling of LED light into the chamber. As the light collection efficiency is high, the size of the chamber can be very small. We tested real PCR reactions using this concept and observed a rapid integration time, enabling very fast reading. Sample preparation has been another challenge for all point-of-care (POC) lab-on-chip devices for many years. Here, we propose a new design which is robust, fast, flexible and simple, and uses a sliding seal to move the collected sample between various reservoir chambers. The sample moves on a slider sandwiched between seals that shuttles a DNA binding membrane between different reactions. Thus, size and volumes of reagents can be increased without increasing dead volumes. This design is easily automated, and positive displacement of fluids can work with many reagents without worrying about their characteristics such as foaming. The speed of the sample preparation protocols is high and complex protocols can be ported on this design concept, which we tested on real clinical samples and obtained impressive results. We designed and injection molded devices to test and verify this concept. Finally, we focus on instrumentation and software required to allow our technology to be used at the POC. We describe our embedded electronics and describe the powerful micro-controller and various high performance ICs that are used to construct a fully functional for sample to answer instrument. We developed various versions of software. The developer software allows us to control our system and bench top setup. Our end user product includes a tablet and cell phone software interface. Software was developed for a windows 8 tablet, windows 8 phone and an Android based devices. To conclude, we very briefly describe the POC systems that are under development: A portable qPCR system with a separate cartridge design, and a universal sample to answer system that performs qPCR, sample preparation and sample to answer protocols in one box depending on the cartridge. As per best of our knowledge the cost of this technology is much lower than any other option in its class. The sample to answer instrument is expected to cost less than 500. The test cost is expected to be less than 5. The performance is not compromised. We hope that this work can help bring a transformative change in the practice of pathology especially in the developing world. ...|$|R

40|$|This report aims to {{describe}} {{the work of a}} bachelor thesis with a major in product development at Saab. The bachelor thesis is to improve one of Saabs existing products called MIT, short for “Moving Infantry Target”. MIT is used all around the world in harsh environment with high standards. MIT consists of one of Saabs other product SIT, short for “Stationary Infantry Target”, mounted on a trolley. SIT is a standard product of Saab but has to be modified before being mounted on MIT. The modification consists of the MDU, short for “Motor driving Unit”, and is a circuit board for controlling the electric engines located on the MIT trolley. The thesis aims to relocate the MDU from inside the SIT to the MIT trolley and still fulfill the requirements of the MIT. One important requirement is that all products need to have IP classification 67. IP classification is a standard measurement on how water and <b>dust</b> <b>proof</b> a product is. To fulfill the requirements a protective box for MDU was developed. During the process there was some question in focus. Where should the box be located? Which manufacturing and materials should be used? How should the cable go inside the box {{and at the same time}} have IP classification 67 ? This was the basis for the work when developing the concepts. Two concepts were created in total. The first concept is about the location and how to attach MDU with the protective box. Next step concept is about how the lid will be attached and the cable lead-through. A 3 D model was created using the winning concepts and from that 3 D model a prototype was created.

Within four test runs on different machines nearly all tested packages resistes the young larvae of Plodia interpunctella. The packages with peeltop system of VG Nicolaus were as the only water and pressure tight and insect proof. This is achieved by glueing a plastic membrane underneath the overlapping flaps of the package. Similar as with the Espresso system with a paper mebrane of the Effem company, insects may hide underneath the overlapping flapps outside the inte riour of the box. One bag series was tested as new development and found to be improved. For the first time, all tested rice packages of Müllers Mühle could not be penetrated by larvae. The test series with etheric oils ended without ab breakthrough. The tested chemicals showed either toxic or none effects whatsoever towards the tested insect larvae. An orienting experiment with Diethyl-toluamid reveald some hints as to weather chemical substances can be mixed up with the glue to prevent later invasion of larvae through crevices between the flaps for a while. More sceening and testing is necessary to identify substances and dosages. This should further be combined with micro encapsulation as a means of the right formulation for slow release of the proper repellent amounts...|$|E
40|$|When I {{began my}} {{internship}} with the Granular Mechanics and Regolith Operations laboratory (GMRO), {{also known as}} Swamp Works, I was given the unique opportunity to shadow many teams working on various projects, and decide what projects I wanted to take part in. Before I go into details of my experiences at Swamp Works, I {{would like to take}} a moment to explain what I discovered Swamp Works to be. Swamp Works is a family of hardworking, dedicated, and driven people from various backgrounds and skill sets. These people all work to advance technologies and make science fiction science fact through means of rapid prototyping. They support and encourage failure as an option when learning new things, as long as lesson learned from said failure. In fact, their motto states "Fail, Fast, Forward. " What this means is, not if but when one fails he or she must do so quickly and spring forward from the failure so that his or her progress is not delayed. With this acceptance, it provided me the confidence to dive into a multitude of projects working in various fields and {{with a wide range of}} skill sets. The first project I joined was Badger. My motivation for taking on this project was the opportunity I would have to obtain valuable experience working with 3 D modeling and 3 D printing technologies. Badger was a digging apparatus to be used in a highly dusty environment in a material known as Regolith. Regolith is a scientific term for the dirt or top soil found on planetary bodies. Regolith contains a large quantity of sediments less than lOppm and as a result poses a challenge of keeping it out of any cracks and crevices. Furthermore, regolith can create high levels of electrostatic energy, which can prove damaging to sensitive electrical hardware. With these characteristics in mind, I decided to take on the task of designing and manufacturing a <b>dust</b> <b>proof</b> cover for the sensitive electrical hardware. When I began this project, I did not have the slightest idea as to how to use 3 D modeling software or a means of manufacturing a viable product. As I went along with variants of the design, I became very proficient with a 3 D modeling program known as CREO 2. 0. Upon completion of my 3 D design, I then had the task of manufacturing and having, in my hands, a usable model. To do this I had to work with additive printing technologies also known as 3 D printing. Through my experiences working with Badger, I realized that 3 D modeling is the focal point in much of engineering. With this in mind, I have embraced this fact and decided to further my experience with this software so that I may become a more valuable asset to any firm later in my career. Mid-way through work with Badger, I picked up another project in which I found much interest. I ha~ the opportunity to work side by side with a materials and composites guru in manufacturing carbon composite coupons (test strips) for performing stress, strain, and sheer analysis on. Being from a surfing, kiteboarding, and other water sport background I have always been interested in board design. With this in mind, it is no wonder why I found interest in such a project. I had the opportunity to refine Mold preparatory, composite layup, and composite curing techniques. Following manufacturing of these composite strips, I then performed various stress tests and logged my results. With these results, future teams could create lighter, stronger, and more cost effective composite structures for use in varieties of applications. After my experiences with materials and composites testing, I have obtained crucial appreciation for detailed documentation and analysis that material sciences involve. However, as interesting as composite materials testing has been, I do not feel this is where my future career lies. Another, more on the side, project I have been involved in is building a 626 cubic foot regolith containment chamber for doing full scale testing of robotic systems. This chamber is built of high strength aluminum scaffold materials, 80 / 20, and massive panels of Lexan. Once the chamber is completed, it is be filled with 120 tons of regolith and dubbed the largest regolith test chamber in the world. Through my experiences with building "Big Bin" as we called it, I discovered my demand for engaging and hands on activities. Through all of my incredible experiences working with the Swamp Works at Kennedy Space Center; I have obtained crucial knowledge, insights, and experiences that have fuelled, shaped, and will continue to drive me toward my ultimate goal of obtaining not only a degree in Engineering, but obtaining a job that I can call a career. I want to give much thanks to all of those who mentored me along my journey, and to all who made this opportunity a reality...|$|E
