A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E

Maybe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do}} with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|That afternoon, {{after the}} formal {{negotiations}} concluded, Brezhnev invited the American delegation {{on a tour}} of Vladivostok. Ford enjoyed what he described as a [...] "natural and uninhibited" [...] conversation with Brezhnev during the tour, and his only regret about <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not have more time to see and explore the city: to him, Vladivostok was reminiscent of San Francisco. Kissinger also saw the resemblance, noting that Vladivostok [...] "bore little resemblance to the teeming, hyperactive metropolises of Japan and Korea" [...] he had seen before arriving in the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{ended the}} {{extraordinary}} public career of Otto von Bismarck, who ... had {{presided over the}} affairs of a state he made great and glorious. ... Now the humble posture that he had necessarily adopted in his written communications with his royal master had become his real posture. The old servant, no matter how great and how brilliant, had become in reality what he had always played as on a stage: a servant who could be dismissed at will by his Sovereign. He had defended that royal prerogative because it had allowed him {{to carry out his}} immense will; now the absolute prerogative of the Emperor became what it has always been, the prerogative of the sovereign. Having crushed his parliamentary opponents, flattened and abused his ministers, and refused to allow himself to be bound by any loyalty, Bismarck had no ally left when he needed it. It was not his cabinet nor his parliamentary majority. He had made sure that it remained the sovereign's, and so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fell because of a system that he preserved and bequeathed to the unstable young Emperor.|$|E
2500|$|Following Romani's recovery, the {{delivery}} of the libretto arrived piecemeal, but Bellini set to work again; progress was slow. By 7 January 1829, with Romani having recovered and set off for Venice to fulfill a contract, the composer was [...] "almost up to the 2nd act". Filippo Cicconetti, in his 1859 biography, gives an account of Bellini's working methods, explaining how he set texts to music always with the words {{in front of him}} in order to see how inspired to compose he might become. When it came time to compose the final aria Or sei pago, ol ciel tremendo, the librettist's words gave him no inspiration at all and, at their next meeting, Romani agreed to re-write the text. Returning within half an hour, the second version left Bellini equally cold—as did a third draft. Finally, when asked what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was seeking, Bellini replied: [...] "I want a thought that will be at one and the same time a prayer, an imprecation, a warning, a delirium...". A fourth draft was quickly prepared: [...] "Have I entered into your spirit?" [...] asked the librettist—and he was embraced by the young composer.|$|E

2500|$|Barsine was a noble Persian, {{daughter}} of Artabazus, and wife of Memnon. After Memnon's death, several ancient historians have written {{of a love}} affair between her and Alexander. Plutarch writes, [...] "At any rate Alexander, so it seems, thought it more worthy of a king to subdue his own passions than to conquer his enemies, and so he never came near these women, nor did he associate with any other before his marriage, with the exception only of Barsine. This woman, the widow of Memnon, the Greek mercenary commander, was captured at Damascus. She had received a Greek education, was of a gentle disposition, and could claim royal descent, since her father was Artabazus who had married one of the Persian kings daughters. These qualities made Alexander the more willing he was encouraged by Parmenio, so Aristobulus tells us to form an attachment to a woman of such beauty and noble lineage." [...] In addition Justin writes, [...] "As he afterwards contemplated the wealth and display of Darius, he was seized with admiration of such magnificence. Hence <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> first began to indulge in luxurious and splendid banquets, {{and fell in love}} with his captive Barsine for her beauty, by whom he had afterwards a son that he called Heracles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even so, the {{decision}} to omit Ranjitsinhji took a long time, proved unpopular when it was made and led to discussion in the press. The Times correspondent commented during the first Test: [...] "There was some feeling about K. S. Ranjitsinhji's absence, but although the Indian Prince has learnt all his cricket in England he could scarcely, if {{the title of the}} match were to be adhered to, have been included in the English eleven", but The Field supported his inclusion. Meanwhile, Ranjitsinhji's good form continued. The team for the second Test was chosen by a different committee, and Ranjitsinhji was included, probably for financial reasons to attract more spectators. The batsman insisted that he would only play if the Australian team had no objections, but the Australian captain was pleased that the Indian would be included. Discussion continued in the press over how appropriate <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should play for England, but from that point, Ranjitsinhji was considered eligible to play for England. The controversy may have upset Ranjitsinhji as his form wavered while the first Test was played and on his next appearance at Lord's, before the MCC committee, he made a pointed attack on the bowling in a rapid innings of 47.|$|E
