5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E
25|$|Perkin {{could not}} <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> better time or place for his discovery: England was {{the cradle of}} the Industrial Revolution, largely driven by {{advances}} {{in the production of}} textiles; the science of chemistry had advanced {{to the point where it}} could have a major impact on industrial processes; and coal tar, the major source of his raw material, was an abundant by-product of the process for making coal gas and coke.|$|E
25|$|When the Romans {{arrived in}} Lothian {{at the end}} of the 1st century AD, they {{discovered}} a Celtic Brittonic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini. At some point before the 7th century AD, the Gododdin, who were presumably descendants of the Votadini, built the hill fort of Din Eidyn or Etin. Although its location has not been identified, it seems likely they would <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> commanding position like the Castle Rock, Arthur's Seat, or Calton Hill.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{when the}} 204 was withdrawn, {{it had been}} joined in the Peugeot range by the 'supermini' class Peugeot 104. Like the 203 before it, the 204 had no {{immediate}} replacement. Ultimately the hatchback Peugeot 205 introduced late in 1982 occupied a market position comparable to that occupied till 1976 by the 204. In the meantime the Peugeot 304 soldiered on until 1980, complemented since late 1977 by its replacement. Once the 304 was being produced in tandem with its successor it could be priced more aggressively, so that customers who till 1976 would <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> 204 were able to afford what was virtually the same car with a larger engine and a larger boot/trunk.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two hours}} elapsed {{between the time}} the ships got under way until the opening shots were fired. In that time, they found that New Ironsides had severe {{handling}} problems in the strong current and shallow water. She was forced to stop and anchor to avoid going aground, {{just about the time}} that the lead monitors were coming under fire. She dropped out of the line, and the four ships following her passed around, with some difficulty. The waiting Rebels could not <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> better place for New Ironsides to anchor, as she was directly over a 3000-pound (1360kg) electrically-triggered torpedo that would be activated by closing a switch on shore. Their high hopes were dashed, however, when the switch was closed and nothing happened. Two explanations for the failure have been offered. According to the one, an ordnance wagon had broken the wires by being driven over them. The other holds that the wires were simply too long, so the electric current would not be great enough to create a spark and detonate the charge.|$|E
500|$|This, Roosevelt writes, {{would be}} an {{extremely}} rare sight in nature. Worse, the female (the peahen) would, he argues, be conspicuous in those conditions. The Thayers <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> blue sky {{to argue that the}} peacock is camouflaged; but then they choose a white sky to allow the prongbuck's white rump to fade into that background. This, Roosevelt argues, is so dishonest that an engineer who constructed a report in that way would at once be dismissed, and the directors of a corporation who [...] "tried to float shares on the strength of such a report" [...] would be liable to [...] "prosecution for fraud".|$|E

Rumors appeared that Dagda, {{the name of a}} god from Irish mythology and a [...] "neutral" [...] name, was indeed proposed {{by a member of the}} CSBM but was not used in the end. Ortiz went on to say [...] "I am not happy, I think the [...] decision is unfortunate and sets a bad precedent." [...] The Spanish newspaper ABC [...] went on to call the decision a [...] "US conquest", asserting that politics played a major role as the US had 10 times more scientists in the IAU than Spain had.|$|E
500|$|The first Indian KFC was a two-storey outlet on {{the fashionable}} Brigade Road in Bangalore in June 1995. According to {{journalist}} Michael White, {{the company could}} not <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> [...] "more difficult venue for its maiden entrée into the country". Bangalore housed {{the headquarters of the}} Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one of the most influential, vocal and anti-foreign investment farmers' associations in the country. The first outlet suffered protests from left wing, anti-globalisation and environmental campaigners, as well as local farmers, who objected to the chain bypassing local producers. Many Indians were concerned about the onslaught of consumerism, the loss of national self-sufficiency, and the disruption of indigenous traditions. The protests came to a head in August 1995, when the Bangalore outlet was repeatedly ransacked. The KFC outlet in Bangalore demanded, and received, a police van permanently parked outside for a year. The outlet was closed on September 13, 1995 by local authorities, who claimed the company used illegally high amounts of monosodium glutamate (MSG) in its food. The outlet re-opened a few hours later as the result of an appeal by KFC to the Karnataka High Court. The company stated the recipe was no different than that used in any other KFC store. Rural activist M. D. Nanjundaswamy claimed KFC would adversely affect the health of the impoverished, by diverting grain from poor people to make the more profitable animal feed. Environmentalist Maneka Gandhi joined the anti-KFC movement. A second outlet opened in Delhi, but was closed by the authorities throughout November, purportedly for health reasons, but more likely to avoid a repetition of the Bangalore incident. The Delhi outlet soon closed permanently.|$|E

2500|$|When Time {{magazine}} {{asked about}} The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, [...] "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting {{to see people}} {{going out there and}} doing that in the name of your character.

So they really couldn't <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> better cause." [...] Rowling awarded The Harry Potter Alliance a Fan Site Award in December 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Since Kean's time, {{many other}} actors who {{have played the}} role <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>a</b> {{sympathetic}} approach to the character. Edwin Booth was a notable exception, playing him as a simple villain, although his father Junius Brutus Booth had portrayed the character sympathetically. Henry Irving's portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by Ellen Terry) has been called [...] "the summit of his career". Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century actors in this role, speaking in Yiddish in an otherwise English-language production.|$|E

2500|$|Paradise Lost is, {{among other}} things, {{a poem about}} civil war. Satan raises 'impious war in Heav'n' (i 43) by leading {{a third of the}} angels in revolt against God. The term 'impious war' implies that civil war is impious. But Milton applauded the English people for having the courage to depose and execute King Charles I. In his poem, however, he takes the side of 'Heav'n's awful Monarch' (iv 960).

2500|$|Chronic {{circadian}} rhythm disorders, {{the most common}} of which is delayed sleep phase disorder, may be managed by specifically-timed bright light therapy, usually in the morning, darkness therapy in the hours before bedtime, and timed oral administration of the hormone melatonin.

When these therapies are unsuccessful, counseling may be indicated to help a person adapt to and live with the condition.
