5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was more}} often {{substitute}} than starter {{in the first}} few weeks of 2012–13 under new manager Robert Maaskant, but went on to re-establish himself in the side. A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant <b>he</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or just not being selected. Groningen finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E

Martin finished the 2010–11 season by winning his record 7th Players' Championship.|$|E

Due to his involvement for England in the inaugural International Origin against the Exiles, he was also rested for Wigan's away game against Castleford.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, <b>he</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> large part of the season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but <b>he</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E
50|$|Walsh {{struggled}} {{through the first}} ten weeks of the 2016 season, missing four extra points along with four field goal attempts. <b>He</b> <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> extra point in a 26-20 Week 10 loss to the Washington Redskins which led to his release by the Vikings on November 15, 2016.|$|R
50|$|In April 2017, Dunne {{lost in a}} sudden-death playoff to Edoardo Molinari at the Trophée Hassan II. <b>He</b> <b>missed</b> <b>an</b> eight foot par putt on {{the first}} extra hole to allow Molinari to win the event with a par. This is Dunne's best finish on the European Tour to date.|$|R
50|$|At {{the opening}} GP of the 2013 season in Fraunefeld, Switzerland, Willemsen {{suffered}} eleven fractures when his sidecar overturned {{and he had}} to be removed by paramedics.

5|$|Born in Preston, {{he began}} playing {{football}} {{at a young}} age, taking inspiration from his father who played semi-professionally. Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. <b>He</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003–04 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers {{at the end of}} that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.|$|E
5|$|Brodie joined League Two club Morecambe on 19 July 2012 on {{a six-month}} loan. He made his debut in Morecambe's 2012–13 opener as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Jordan Burrow in their 2–1 away victory over Championship team Blackpool on 12 August 2012 in the League Cup first round. His first start came on 18 August 2012 in Morecambe's 3–0 win away to Exeter City on 18 August 2012. Having scored six goals in 27 appearances, {{he returned to}} Crawley on 2 January 2013 as Morecambe were not in a financial position to extend his loan. On 4 January 2013, Brodie joined Conference Premier team Grimsby Town on loan {{until the end of}} 2012–13. He made his debut the following day, starting Grimsby's 1–1 home draw with Hereford United, before scoring his first goal in a 4–2 win at home to Alfreton Town on 2 February 2013. Brodie was released from his loan spell on 25 March 2013, the day after <b>he</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> penalty in the 4–1 penalty shoot-out defeat against Wrexham in the 2013 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium.

5|$|Crewe manager Dario Gradi {{decided not}} to offer a {{contract}} to Symes, who instead spent a period on trial at Bradford City, which included an 8–1 pre-season friendly win over Farsley Celtic. He signed for the League One side in July 2004 with fellow former Everton trainee Steven Schumacher, with whom he lived during his spell at Bradford. Symes made his Bradford debut in a 2–1 defeat at Hartlepool United on {{the opening day of}} the 2004–05 season. Three days later <b>he</b> <b>missed</b> <b>a</b> late penalty which would have secured Bradford victory over Peterborough United in a game in which Symes was also booked. Symes was dropped from the first team after Bradford signed Dele Adebola. When Bradford were allowed special dispensation to sign Neil Roberts, Bradford tried to give Symes a loan transfer to Darlington but the deal was blocked by the Football League. The following month, Symes scored his first goals for Bradford when he came off the bench at half-time to score twice in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 23 October 2004. They were the only goals he scored that season from just 15 games.|$|E
