5|$|In Canada and Sweden <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> {{that growing}} {{a mosaic of}} {{different}} crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape, {{despite the fact that}} the bees were attracted to the crop.|$|E

5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion.

5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies.

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> {{that some of these}} drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E

5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions.

To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
