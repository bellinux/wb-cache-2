The Enclosed Laminar Flames (ELF) experiment objective was to validate the zero-gravity Burke-Schumann model and the gravity-dependent Hegde-Bahadori extension of the model, investigate the importance of the buoyancy-dependent flow field as affected by oxidizer flow on flame stabilization, examine the state relationships of co-flow diffusion flames under the influence of buoyancy conditions (gravity versus pressure), and study the flow vortex and diffusion flame interactions. The Particle Engulfment and Pushing by Solidifying Interfaces (PEP) experiment objectives were to generate an accurate value for the critical velocity in a convection-free environment, validate present theoretical model, enhance fundamental understanding of dynamics of insoluble particles at liquid/solid interfaces, and improve understanding of physics associated with solidification of liquid metals-ceramic particles mixtures.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we enhance an {{architecture}} description language with {{a description of}} component behavior. A notation used for this purpose should be able to express the "interplay" on the component's interfaces and reflect step-by-step refinement of the component's specification during its design. In addition, the notation should be easy to comprehend and allow for formal reasoning about the correctness of the specification refinement and also about the correctness of an implementation in terms of whether it adheres to the specification. Targeting all these requirements together, the paper proposes toemploy behavior protocols which are based on a notation similar to regular expressions. As a proof of the concept, the behavior protocols are used in the SOFA architecture description language at three levels: <b>interface,</b> <b>frame,</b> and architecture.

40|$|Abstract. This paper explores ways {{by which}} {{inheritance}} {{can be defined}} for and used in specification languages, especially ADLs and CDLs that are now widely used in software engineering for specifying software architectures and components. The fact that most specification languages share many properties with object oriented languages – which use inheritance for variety of purposes – is the main motivation for this research. We will analyze {{the roles of the}} inheritance concept in specification languages and try to find criteria for evaluating it. The main focus, however, will be on proposing inheritance for the main abstractions of SOFA CDL – a practically used component definition language.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we enhance the SOFA Component Description Language with a {{semantic}} {{description of a}} component's functionality. There are two key requirements this description aims to address: First, for the design purpose, it should ensure correct composition of the nested architectural abstractions; second, it should be easy-to-read so that an average user can identify a component with the correct semantics {{for the purposes of}} component trading. The semantic description in SOFA expresses the behavior of the component in terms of behavior protocols using a notation similar to regular expressions which is easy-to-read, and which grants guarantees about required and provided services. The behavior protocols are used on three levels: <b>interface,</b> <b>frame,</b> and architecture. One of the key achievements of this paper is that it defines a protocol conformance relation where the component designer can statically verify that the frame protocol adheres to requirements of the interface protocols, and that the architecture protocol adheres to the requirements of the frame and interface protocols...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept and}} use of {{knowledge}} in business studies is predominantly determined by a Western interpretation, with strategic management theory and practice positioning knowledge as {{a key factor in}} the creation of competitive advantage. The thesis examines Western and Aboriginal ways of knowing, and explores the presuppositions of knowledge in Western culture. Utilising critical theory the thesis has researched and penetrated the cultural interface between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people during business negotiations. The research is a first order interpretation by a non-Aboriginal researcher that critically analyses and unpacks the non-Aboriginal discourse of cross-cultural negotiations. The thesis reveals the impact of Western normative culture on the construction of cross-cultural knowledge. It is argued the current Western orientation of strategic management theory fails cross-cultural negotiations, and that ways of knowing outside the paradigm of traditional strategic management research can provide a broader understanding of knowledge and improve cross-cultural negotiations. The thesis argues that the models for understanding national cultures are Western orientated models that may have inherent cultural limits. The thesis draws upon frame theory, and argues that cultural schema and mental models known as frames {{have a significant impact on}} cross-cultural negotiations. The significance of the research resides in two primary areas. Firstly the literature regarding knowledge in strategic management is inclined to be positivist with a strong Western academic influence. This thesis argues that the literature and discipline of strategic management will be enriched by a more heterogenous approach to knowledge through a diversity of research paradigms, and through understanding other cultural approaches to knowledge. This thesis contributes through an interpretive perspective to strategic management theory and practice. Secondly the research contributes to the literature, theory and practice of cross-cultural negotiations. Specifically there is a paucity of literature on Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal negotiations, and this thesis through the critical discourse analysis of negotiations provides a significant insight into this cultural <b>interface.</b> <b>Frame</b> theory assists understanding how non-Aboriginal negotiators make meaning during cross-cultural negotiations and how this influences their understanding of knowledge. The thesis concludes with two key recommendations. Firstly that strategic management research, theory and practice will be well served by a broader approach to knowledge. This will be achieved by recognising that a positivist approach to research in strategic management has limitations, and the management models of knowledge have culturally imbued presuppositions or schema that frame our interpretation of ways of knowing. Secondly two models for cross-cultural negotiations are proposed. The models recommend that we suspend our own constructs of reality to engage with other ways of knowing in a reflective process to generate new schemas of knowledge...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a novel {{perspective on the}} theoretical foundation of human-computer <b>interfaces,</b> <b>framing</b> the problem as a continuous control process. In this view, the system continuously infers a distribution over potential user goals, and provides continuous feedback about its beliefs as it does so. The proper representation and manipulation of uncertainties in interaction – via probability theory – and the explicit inclusion of temporal characteristics – {{in the form of}} dynamic systems – are inherent to this framework. The framework is used to derive a novel approach to interaction design, particularly in situations where rich or unusual sensing and display modalities are present. A number of key tools for describing and implementing systems which are consistent with this perspective are presented. The role of system dynamics as a mediating element between sensed state and decision making is described. The work sets out a paradigm for interaction which brings probabilistic models – and thus many of the techniques of modern machine learning – into the interface in a clean and principled manner. The three major techniques for supporting the paradigm outlined in the thesis are: the display of changing probabilistic beliefs; dynamically adjusting system handling qualitie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two studies {{examine the}} effect of the {{geometric}} forms of nodes of a concept map, presented prior to reading a text, on its comprehension. In the first study we varied the map interface. 162 students received a concept map to study. The map was presented in one of five interfaces: two bi-form interfaces (ellipses for content and rectangles for structure concepts, and vice versa), two uniform interfaces (ellipses or rectangles node frames), or a concept map without frames. Then a text was given to study without the map, and a comprehension test followed. Three texts were studied. The results indicated no comprehension differences between the two bi-form groups and neither between the two uniform groups. The comprehension scores were higher for the bi-form compared with the uniform <b>interface.</b> The no <b>frame</b> <b>interface</b> received the lowest scores. Before and after studying the texts, the students ranked their preferences for the various map interfaces.

40|$|M. Phil. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) Without any doubt, {{the entire}} range of voice and TV signals will migrate to the packet network. The {{universal}} addressable mode of Internet protocol (IP) and the <b>interfacing</b> <b>framing</b> structure of Ethernet are the main reasons behind the success of TCP/IP and Ethernet as a packet network and network access scheme mechanisms. Unfortunately, the success of the Internet has been the problem for real-time traffic such as voice, leading to more studies in the domain of Teletraffic Engineering; and the lack of a resource reservation mechanism in Ethernet, which constitutes a huge problem as switching system mechanism, have raised enough challenges for such a migration. In that context, ITU-T has released a series of Recommendation under the umbrella of H. 323 to guarantee the required Quality of Service (QoS) for such services. Although the “utilisation” is not a good parameter in terms of traffic and QoS, we are here in proposing a multiplexing scheme with a queuing solution that takes into account the positive correlations of the packet arrival process experienced at the multiplexer input with the aim to optimize the utilisation of the buffer and bandwidth on the one hand; and the ITU-T H. 323 Endpoints and Terminals configuration that can sustain such a multiplexing scheme on the other hand. We take into account the solution of the models from the M/M/ 1 up to G/G/ 1 queues based on Kolmogorov’s analysis as our solution to provide a better justification of our approach. This solution, the Diffusion approximation, is the limit of the Fluid process that has not been used enough as queuing solution in the domain of networking. Driven by the results of the Fluid method, and the resulting Gaussian distribution from the Diffusion approximation, the application of the asymptotic properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) as the central limit theorem allowed capturing the fluctuations and therefore filtering out the positive correlations in the queue system. This has resulted in a queue system able to serve 1 erlang (100 % of transmission link capacity) of traffic intensity without any extra delay and a queue length which is 60 % of buffer utilization when compared to the ordinary Poisson queue length...|$|R
