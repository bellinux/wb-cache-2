5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> (HRT) {{based on}} {{estrogen}} preparations {{are the most}} powerful treatments to prevent menopause symptoms. However, they are associated to {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer and they sustain the development of Estrogen Receptor α-positive tumors (ERα+). In addition, we have previously observed that estradiol (E 2) can promote the growth of ERα-negative (ERα-) tumors, by increasing tumor angiogenesis that subsequently improves oxygen and nutrients delivery, thereby preventing hypoxia and necrosis. To identify new and safe drugs for the development of HRT presenting a better benefit/risk ratio, it is therefore necessary to evaluate the potential impact of new candidates on both ERα+ and ERα- tumors. In this context, estetrol (E 4), a natural estrogen exclusively produced by the fetal liver, is a promising candidate...|$|R

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy,</b> and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.

40|$|All {{postmenopausal}} <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> (HTs) aim {{to provide}} a steady mid-follicular serum concentration of estrogen, {{with the exception of}} pulsed estrogen therapy, which concentrates hormone exposure in the few hours following administration. This alteration in the kinetics of estradiol exposure does not change the beneficial effect of HT on climacteric symptoms or bone loss, but does reduce the stimulation of the breast and uterus leading to less mastalgia and bleeding. The following hypothesis provides a plausible pharmacological explanation as to how estradiol kinetics can selectively modify tissue response. Pulsed estradiol exposure influences the relative abundance of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, via a tissue-dependent non-genomic signaling pathway, resulting in selective upregulation and activation of ERbeta in breast and endometrium, but not in bone. In addition, pulsed estrogen exposure also increases local concentration of 2 -methoxyestradiol, a specific estradiol metabolite with proven anti-tumor properties...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPituitary hormone deficiencies, with Growth Hormone {{deficiency}} being {{most frequent}} (1 in 3, 500 - 10, 000 births), cause significant morbidity. Regeneration of missing endocrine cells {{would be a}} significant improvement over <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies,</b> which incur side effects and do not mimic physiological secretion patterns. Recent in vitro studies have identified a population of adult pituitary progenitors that express the HMG box transcription factors SOX 2 and SOX 9. Here, we apply cell-lineage tracing analysis to demonstrate that SOX 2 - and SOX 9 -expressing progenitors can self-renew and give rise to endocrine cells in vivo, suggesting that they are tissue stem cells. Moreover, we show that they can become mobilized and differentiate into the appropriate endocrine cell types in response to physiological stress. Our results highlight the pituitary {{as a model for}} exploring how physiological changes influence stem cell behavior and suggest that manipulation of endogenous pituitary stem cells is a potential therapeutic strategy for pituitary deficiencies.

40|$|Abstract Transient hypothyroxinaemia of {{prematurity}} (THOP) is common. The {{preponderance of}} evidence indicates that {{at the very least}} THOP is a marker of elevated risk of neurodevelopmental adversity. Existing observational and experimental studies could neither support nor dispute the use of thyroid hormones in preterm infants. The experimental studies 39 - 42 done so far had major limitations because of the small number of infants enrolled in the trials. For future large multicenter randomized trials, energies should be focused on assessing neurodevelopment objectively in survivors and consider enrolling only those infants most likely to benefit from thyroid <b>hormones</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> Moreover, the addition of triiodothyronine (T 3) to the treatment schedule needs to be seriously considered. Furthermore, since local pilot study revealed iodine deficiency in 35. 8 % of the studied healthy pregnant women 3 and the effect of iodine deficiency may probably be more significant in preterms, one will probably choose to treat.

40|$|Hormones play a {{major role}} in {{regulating}} behavior and physiology, and their efficacy is often dependent on the temporal pattern in which they are secreted. Significant insights into the mechanisms underlying rhythmic hormone secretion have been gained from transgenic rodent models, suggesting that many of the body's rhythmic functions are regulated by a coordinated network of central and peripheral circadian pacemakers. Some neuroendocrine rhythms are driven by transcriptional-posttranslational feedback circuits comprising ‘core clock genes’, while others represent a cyclic cascade of neuroendocrine events. This review focuses on recent data from the rhesus macaque, a non-human primate model with high clinical translation potential. With primary emphasis on adrenal and gonadal steroids, it illustrates the rhythmic nature of hormone secretion, and discusses the impact that fluctuating hormone levels have on the accuracy of clinical diagnoses and on the design of effective <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> in the elderly.

40|$|SUMMARY P 450 {{oxidoreductase}} deficiency (PORD) is {{a variant}} of congenital adrenal hyperplasia that is caused by POR gene mutations. The POR gene encodes a flavor protein that transfers electrons from {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) to all microsomal cytochrome P 450 type II (including 21 -hydroxylase, 17 &# 945;-hydroxylase 17, 20 lyase and aromatase), which is fundamental for their enzymatic activity. POR mutations cause variable impairments in steroidogenic enzyme activities that result in wide phenotypic variability ranging from 46,XX or 46,XY disorders of sexual differentiation, glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without skeletal malformations similar to Antley-Bixler syndrome to asymptomatic newborns diagnosed during neonatal screening test. Little is known about the PORD long-term evolution.
