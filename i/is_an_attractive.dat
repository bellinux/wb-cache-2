5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{formation}} of hemozoin {{is essential to the}} survival of these parasites, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> target for developing drugs and is much-studied in Plasmodium as a way to find drugs to treat malaria (malaria's Achilles' heel). Several currently used antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, are thought to kill malaria parasites by inhibiting haemozoin biocrystallization.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> {{country for}} foreign investors {{mainly because of}} its low wages, low tax rates and well educated labour force.

25|$|The {{minimization}} {{of radiation}} dose {{to the subject}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> feature {{of the use of}} short-lived radionuclides. Besides its established role as a diagnostic technique, PET has an expanding role as a method to assess the response to therapy, in particular, cancer therapy, where the risk to the patient from lack of knowledge about disease progress is much greater than the risk from the test radiation.|$|E
25|$|Many useful organic {{reactions}} {{involve the}} formation of tetrahedral intermediates through nucleophilic attack of functional groups such as aldehydes, amides or imines. In these cases, catalysis with hydrogen bond donors <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> strategy since the anionic tetrahedral intermediates are better hydrogen bond acceptors than the starting compound. This means that relative to the initial catalyst-substrate complex, the transition state, bearing more negative charge, is stabilized.|$|E
25|$|The flame flower (Tropaeolum speciosum) is well {{adapted to}} cool, moist climates and famously does well in Scotland. It sends up shoots which thread {{their way through}} hedges and shrubs and which, when they emerge into the light, bear {{brilliant}} red flowers among small, five or six-lobed leaves. It is difficult to establish but <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> garden plant when it thrives. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

The percentage {{figure in the}} bonus column shows the bonus's value {{in relation to a}} Partner's salary. 8.33% would mean one additional month's salary and 16.66% would mean two months' salary, showing that the staff has received more than one month's additional salary as bonus each year since 2000. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> facet of the company, which has a reputation for looking after its staff (including paid secondments whilst Partners conduct charity work; subsidised Dining Rooms and staff excursions, amongst other benefits).|$|E
25|$|Mount Fuji <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> {{volcanic}} cone and {{a frequent}} subject of Japanese art especially after 1600, when Edo (now Tokyo) became the actual capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the Tōkaidō road. Among the most renowned works are Hokusai's 36 Views of Mount Fuji and his One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, as well as Utagawa Hiroshige's similarly-titled 36 Views of Mount Fuji (1858). The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages and {{is the subject of}} many poems. One of the modern artists who depicted Fuji in almost all her works was Tamako Kataoka.|$|E

25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem {{cuttings}} and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|E
25|$|Perfoliate {{pondweed}} is {{not widely}} cultivated, which is perhaps surprising {{as it is}} not ecologically demanding and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive</b> plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even in a barrel, but unlike some other submerged plants {{needs to be able}} to root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Keeping nutrient levels low helps to prevent smothering by algae and more invasive aquatic plants. Plants being established should be weighted down initially to allow them to root, and benefit from being planted among other aquatic plants that can act as a 'nursery'. Transplants have a high survival rate once established.|$|E
25|$|Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attractive,</b> {{intelligent}} and popular boy. His manipulative ways often go unnoticed by many, {{and are a}} catalyst {{for the majority of}} the events in the series. Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend and has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks confidence, is socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and conceited, but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from an eating disorder. Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.|$|E
