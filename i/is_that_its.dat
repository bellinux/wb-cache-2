5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> focus on individualism deflects participants {{from engaging in}} socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age {{as a manifestation of}} consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It is a good {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E

Another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> core has already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur, which is unknown at present.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

25|$|X's design {{requires}} the clients and server to operate separately, and device {{independence and the}} separation of client and server incur overhead.

A common criticism of X <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> network features result in excessive complexity and decreased performance if only used locally.|$|E
25|$|The major {{technical}} {{difference between}} Edo and Kamigata prints is the latter's use of kappazuri stencil printing, where colours were brushed onto paper {{with the aid}} of paper stencil patterns.

Also distinctive about kamigata-e <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>its</b> producers were not professional artists like their Edo counterparts. Instead, they were talented amateurs whose artistic interests were secondary to their passion for kabuki and its actors.|$|E
