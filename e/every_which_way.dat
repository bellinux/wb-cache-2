25|$|McEachin played Mr. Turner, a tax {{collector}} for the I.R.S., {{and later a}} character called Solomon Jackson, a co-worker that Archie Bunker tries to recruit for his social club, on the television show All in the Family. He played the deejay Sweet Al Monte in Play Misty for Me (1971) with Clint Eastwood. In 1973, he starred as Harry Tenafly, the title character in Tenafly, a short-lived detective series about a police officer turned private detective who relied on his wits and hard work rather than guns and fistfights. He also appeared occasionally as Lieutenant Ron Crockett on Emergency!. In 1978, he played {{a police officer in}} <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> But Loose. In 1979, he played the role of a jaded ex-marine high school baseball coach in an episode ("Out at Home") of The White Shadow.|$|E
25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection. Eggman tries to steal it, so Knuckles shatters it aboard Eggman's hovercraft, sending the pieces <b>every</b> <b>which</b> <b>way.</b> He spends the game recollecting the pieces similarly to in Adventure. He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, {{as well as a}} key to an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides the shards are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off. The game's antagonist Gerald Robotnik, Eggman's grandfather, initiates a program to send the ARK {{on a collision course with}} Earth as revenge for an attack on the ARK decades earlier, so Knuckles teams up with the other playable characters to reroute it.|$|E

50|$|His {{official}} {{connection with}} the College commenced in 1843. As the Yale University Library {{was about to be}} removed to a new edifice, he was appointed Librarian, and he continued to discharge the duties of that office fifteen years, till his resignation in 1858. In 1852 he was also appointed Treasurer of Yale College, and he held that post until his death. His services to the College, however, were by no means confined to his official trusts; but he labored for its interests in <b>every</b> <b>way</b> <b>which</b> his versatile industry could suggest.|$|R
500|$|An early draft had Hess {{surrounded}} by others sitting squarely around him. Hess felt the depiction {{had a more}} natural look, Rockwell objected, [...] "It was too diverse, it went <b>every</b> <b>which</b> <b>way</b> and didn't settle anywhere or say anything." [...] He felt the upward view from the bench level was more dramatic. Rockwell explained to Yates at The Post {{that he had to}} start Freedom of Speech from scratch after an early attempt because he had overworked it. Twice he almost completed the work only to feel it was lacking. Eventually, he was able to produce the final version with the speaker as the subject rather than the assembly. For the accompanying essay, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose novelist and dramatist Tarkington who was a Pulitzer Prize winner. People who purchased war bonds during the Second War Bond Drive received a full-color set of reproductions of the Four Freedoms that had a commemorative cover with Freedom of Speech on it.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, he {{directed}} {{and starred in}} The Gauntlet opposite Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mob. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it [...] "...classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny." [...] The following year, he starred in <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> But Loose in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by Geoffrey Lewis) and an orangutan called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1978.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Eastwood {{directed}} {{and played the}} title role in Bronco Billy alongside Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Sam Bottoms. Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as {{being one of the}} most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood's most self-referential character. The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood's career, but was liked by critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was [...] "...the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while", and praised Eastwood's directing, intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West. Later that year, Eastwood starred in Any Which Way You Can, the sequel to <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> But Loose. The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Maslin described it as [...] "funnier and even better than its predecessor". Released over the Christmas season of 1980, Any Which Way You Can was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest-grossing films of the year.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, <b>Every</b> <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. She dropped her suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E

6000|$|I am as {{strongly}} convinced {{as the most}} pronounced individualist can be, that it is desirable that every man {{should be free to}} act in <b>every</b> <b>way</b> <b>which</b> does not limit the corresponding freedom of his fellow-man. But I fail to connect that great induction of political science with the practical corollary which is frequently drawn from it: that the State--that is, the people in their corporate capacity--has no business to meddle with anything but the administration of justice and external defence. It appears to me that the [228] amount of freedom which incorporate society may fitly leave to its members is not a fixed quantity, to be determined a priori by deduction from the fiction called [...] "natural rights"; but that it must be determined by, and vary with, circumstances. I conceive it to be demonstrable that the higher and the more complex the organization of the social body, the more closely is the life of each member bound up with that of the whole; and the larger becomes the category of acts which cease to be merely self-regarding, and which interfere with the freedom of others more or less seriously.|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{link the}} micro-level changes in firms, {{as the source of}} {{production}} behavior, with meso-level changes in industrial structure and macro-level changes in growth and development performance. It focuses on the three great industrial revolutions of {{the last quarter of the}} present millennium. These differed among themselves in almost <b>every</b> major <b>way,</b> <b>which</b> inhibits generalization but shows that systems (here the “national systems of production”) are very different, and that “convergence” of a later industrializing country upon its predecessor is improbable. Each industrial revolution possesses considerable internal logic but is less flexible in regard to adopting features of its successor. As a result, mismatches arise over time between the specified constituents of the production systems, as demonstrated by economic phenomena such as unemployment and political phenomena such as ideology. The task of resolving such mismatches has fallen back on the micro level of firms and households, which itself has imposed serious strains on the productive system. Such heterogeneity imposes severe limitations on the ability to link technological forecasting and social change in the long term...|$|R
