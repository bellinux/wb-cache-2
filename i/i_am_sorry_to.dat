25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{transmit}} to Your Lordship the disagreeable {{account of a}} disagreeable Business, {{some time in the}} Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues had {{extended}} their {{lead to a}} length by the soap works before shooting Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. [...] Although river traffic diverted the Cambridge boat, they remained in contention, two lengths behind Oxford. [...] At Barnes Bridge, the Dark Blues were a further length ahead, and continued to extend their lead until the flag-boat, which they passed six lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 20 minutes 56 seconds. [...] Oxford's victory, their eighth in a row, took their overall lead to 1510 in the event. Willan paid tribute to his cox: [...] "In conclusion, I must again testify to the splendid steering of Tottenham, who for the fifth and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say for the last time has contributed mainly to our victory over Cambridge." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> inform {{you that you are}} the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> inform your Excellency {{that this}} Country {{has got a}} severe stroke {{by the loss of}} Colonel Lochry and about one hundred (tis said) of the best men of Westmoreland County, {{including}} Captain Stockely & his Company of Rangers. They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} {{difficulties}} have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate defeat. {{it seems the}} Appellee [...] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the Appellor [...] in single combat which if not accepted by the Appellor the suit is lost and, if accepted, and the Appellee can hold out from sun rise to sun set, then he wins the contest and claims his discharge, otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing but also the pain of death into the bargain. It is rumoured here that is the plea intended {{to be set up}} by the Def. and unless we can devise any means by arguement to induce the Court not to allow it, I am very apprehensive our poor little Knight {{will never be able to}} contend the Battle with his brutish opponent.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a great}} effort--for him--and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> crush it. 'I regret,' I said, 'that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{compelled}} to deny you unspeakable happiness.' ...|$|R

2500|$|The Saturday Review of 24 December 1859 {{strongly}} criticised {{the methodology}} of Darwin's calculations. On 3 January 1860, Darwin wrote to Hooker about it: [...] "Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, & the Reviewer gives me some good & well deserved raps,—confound it <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument." [...] A day later, he said to Lyell [...] "You saw I suppose Saturday Review: argument confined to Geology, but has given me some perfectly just & severe raps on knuckles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{re-election}} in the 1945 general election on 5 July, Herbert noted {{of the new}} Parliament that [...] "the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see." [...] The Labour Party, under Clement Attlee, had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that [...] "Arrogance, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty." [...] Herbert campaigned {{to ensure that the}} newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of decree nisi, among other things. However, [...] was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time – later in the Parliament, it would be restored.|$|E
2500|$|News {{had reached}} Smith {{that a number}} of French frigates were {{preparing}} to sail from Alexandria to Jaffa to deliver stores and weapons for the French army. [...] Smith ordered Miller to intercept them. Miller was preparing his ship to depart when an unknown accident occurred. Lieutenant England wrote in a report to Sir Sidney Smith It is with extreme concern I have to acquaint you, that yesterday morning, at half-past nine o'clock, twenty 36-howitzer shells, and fifty 18-pounder shells, had been got up and prepared ready for service by Captain Miller's order...when in an instant...the whole was on fire and a dreadful explosion took place. The ship was severely damaged, her aft part almost totally destroyed and the rest on fire. The crew fought the fire and were able to save the ship, but as Lieutenant England reported Our loss from the explosion, I here lament, has been very great; and Captain Miller, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> add, is of the number killed, which amount to 20; drowned, 9; and 45 wounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} useless to {{interrupt}} me.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{hear that}} Dick <b>was</b> killed. <b>I</b> {{gave him his}} first lesson in the musket drill. We had half a dozen muskets in our office {{when it was over}} Isbell's Music Rooms.|$|R
60|$|HUNT. It {{costs as}} much as though it was. And that reminds me, {{speaking}} as one sportsman to another, Mr. Deacon, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> hear that you've been dropping a hatful of money lately.|$|R

60|$|So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> {{lose her}} but was {{relieved}} too. And then Caddy Jellyby came down, and Caddy brought such {{a packet of}} domestic news that it gave us abundant occupation.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> leave Peacock Farm—for so {{the place}} is called, after the name of its splendid pensioners—and go {{forwards}} again in the quiet woods. It began to grow both damp and dusk under the beeches; and as the day declined the colour faded out of the foliage; and shadow, without form and void, took the place of all the fine tracery of leaves and delicate gradations of living green that had before accompanied my walk. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> leave Peacock Farm, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>sorry</b> <b>to</b> find myself once more in the open road, under a pale and somewhat troubled-looking evening sky, and put my best foot foremost for the inn at Wendover.|$|R
