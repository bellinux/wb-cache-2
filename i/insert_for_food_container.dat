40|$|Recent {{experimental}} studies in Japan on {{the evaluation of}} potential health hazards from phthalate esters used in manufacturing poly(vinyl chloride) {{as well as several}} plastics for medical devices and <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> and packages were introduced. Development of pulmonary granuloma formation after intravenous iniection of diethylhexyl phthalate was assumed to be dependent on the particle size of the phthalate in vehicle used. Dietary administration of large amount of diethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate produced renal cysts in mothers and in descendants in reproduction studies in mice. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of the phthalates and several plastics and resins were also examined by in vivo and in vitro studies. Hematological parameters examined in rabbits after repeated intravenous injection of diethylhexyl phthalate and after implantation of plastics in aorta for 3 - 6 months did not show any significant change. A slow decrease of radioactivity was observed in adipose tissue of rats following oral administration of 14 C-labeled diethylhexyl phthalate. The administrative action on phthalates by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare is briefly reviewed. Plastics have found wide usage in medical and paramedical applications as well as <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>containers</b> and wrapping materials. In the past much attention was directed at the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of these materials in meeting the requirements for developing suitable products. However, more recently, attention has been focused on the potential toxic liability of these products when they are used for medical purposes or as contaminants of the food or materials which may come into contact with the human body.

40|$|Egg-laying hens are a type {{of chicken}} that are {{particularly}} vulnerable {{to the risk of}} stress impacting on reducing the amount of egg production. Proper feeding schedule and coop temperature are two important factors in reducing such a risk. A chicken farm usually has many coops and scattered over several places requiring a lot of labors for maintenance. Advances in science and technology, especially in computer and embedded systems offer various solutions to address such an issue by automating the coops of egg-laying hens, so that labors can be greatly reduced. This paper proposed a remote automation system that employs Arduino Mega 2560 board as the central control system, equipped with a Wi-Fi module ESP 8266 for remote accessibility, an electromechanical relay for controlling heating bulbs on and off, servo motor as the actuator <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>container’s</b> lid. The system uses DHT 11 sensor to read room temperature and HC-SR 04 sensor to read distance that relates to the food availability in coops. The result of this research is the system capable of automating the coops that can be remotely controlled through the Blynk application on an Android device.

40|$|Tin electrocoated steel strip, also {{referred}} to as Flandres foil, is largely used <b>for</b> manufacturing <b>food</b> <b>containers.</b> Tinplates must have good corrosion resistance, workability, weldability, as well as a bright appearance. The woodgrain defect, a not yet fully understood defect that occurs on tinplates and accounts for their high scrap rate, consists of alternate bands of bright/dull reflectivity and resembles longitudinally cut wood. Observations of the woodgrain defect by scanning electron microscopy showed that the molten tin spreads irregularly during both the melting and solidification stages. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the metallic tin tended to crystallize in the (200) direction for coupons with and without the woodgrain defect. Nevertheless, the preferential orientation degree decreased for coupons with the woodgrain defect. The rocking curves, also known as omega-scan, showed that the tin grains were uniformly aligned parallel to the strip surface for coupons with no defects, whereas for tinplates with woodgrain, the tin grains were not uniformly oriented, probably due to the misalignment of the grains in relation to the surface.
