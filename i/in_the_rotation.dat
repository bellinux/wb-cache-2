5|$|Sánchez {{was sent}} back to Fresno on August 11 to make room for Brian Wilson on the roster. He {{returned}} in September, and he replaced Lowry (who was injured) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> He made four starts, but he lost three of them and had a 7.16 ERA in all four of them. After straining his left oblique muscle in his fourth start, he was shut down {{for the rest of the}} season and replaced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> by Travis Blackley. He finished the year 1–5 with a 5.88 ERA in thirty-three games (four starts).|$|E
5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> Young has since been pitching in the third spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> The number three spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E
5|$|Adams again {{became a}} free agent before the 2010 season, but he {{resigned}} with the Roughriders.

5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation,</b> he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed to crack the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2015, the Braves traded Miller and Gabe Speier to the Arizona Diamondbacks in {{exchange}} for Dansby Swanson, Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair.

Before the 2016 season began, Miller was projected to follow ace Zack Greinke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> He struggled once the season began, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list on May 24 due to a sprained index finger, making his return on June 20. Miller pitched to a 2–9 record and a 7.14 ERA through the MLB All-Star break, when the Diamondbacks optioned him to the Reno Aces of the PCL. Miller was recalled to start against the San Francisco Giants on August 31. He pitched five innings, yielding two runs on six hits.

5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron.

5|$|As the 2003 season began, Robertson was {{competing}} alongside Brad Lidge, Kirk Saarloos, and Pete Munro for {{the final}} spot in the Astros' starting rotation. He pitched the entire month of spring training, and when the season began he was granted the final spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation.</b> Robertson made his season debut on April 3, and allowed eight earned runs in 4⅓ innings, losing the match against the Colorado Rockies 10–5. He got his first career victory on April 10, allowing two hits in seven innings in a 4–2 victory against the Cincinnati Reds. He struggled in his next three starts, {{and by the end}} of April Robertson had a 1–3 record and an ERA of 7.99, which caused manager Jimy Williams to consider moving him back to the bullpen. After a May 2 matchup against the Atlanta Braves further increased his ERA, Robertson was demoted to the minor leagues, but only played with the Zephyrs for one game before being placed back on the major league roster ten days later.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{agreed to}} re-sign with the Lakers on July 2, 2012 {{and was named}} to the Lakers team for the July 1322 Las Vegas NBA Summer League. During the Summer League, Morris led the Lakers in scoring and assists. On November 9, 2012, Darius Morris {{recorded}} 10 points, a career-high 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 steal in a 10177 Lakers win over the Golden State, backing up Blake, while Steve Nash was injured. On November 13, with both Blake and Nash injured, Morris made his first career start against the San Antonio Spurs. As a starter, Morris posted career highs of 31 minutes and 6 assists on November 16 against the Phoenix Suns. On December 4, Chris Duhon overtook Morris as the replacement starter. On December 16, Morris posted a career-high 15 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. A few nights later, Kobe Bryant praised him for his defensive effort. When Nash returned to the starting lineup on December 22, Morris started in place of Metta World Peace, who came off the bench. This was part of a common strategy employed by Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni to play players out of position. While a starter, Morris' responsibility was to defend against the opponents' most dangerous perimeter player. On January 4, World Peace returned to the starting lineup in Morris' place. Then in late January, Jodie Meeks replaced Morris <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> as Blake also returned to the rotation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNitrogen (N) {{leaching}} from {{agricultural soils}} {{is a major}} concern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern USA. A winter cover crop following <b>the</b> summer crop <b>rotation</b> is essential for controlling N leaching and soil run-off, thereby improving sustainable development. Rotation of peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) (i. e. sod-based rotation) can greatly improve soil health and increase crop yields and profitability. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> sod-based <b>rotation,</b> <b>the</b> winter cover crop is an important component. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine effects of summer crops, cotton and peanut, on growth and physiology of a subsequent oat (Avena sativa L.) cover crop in both a conventional (Peanut-Cotton-Cotton) and sod-based (Bahiagrass-Bahiagrass-Peanut-Cotton) rotations. Two rotations with an oat cover crop were established <b>in</b> 2000. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 growing seasons, oat plant height, leaf chlorophyll and sap NO 3 -N concentrations, shoot biomass, and N uptake were determined. Our results showed that the previous summer crop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>rotations</b> significantly influenced oat growth and physiology. Oat grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sod-based <b>rotation</b> had greater biomass, leaf chlorophyll and NO 3 -N concentrations as compared with oat grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>rotation.</b> At pre-heading stage, oat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sod-based <b>rotation</b> had 44 % greater biomass and 32 % higher N uptake than oat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conventional rotation; oat following peanut produced 40 to 49 % more biomass and accumulated 27 to 66 % more N than oat following cotton. Therefore, <b>the</b> sod-based <b>rotation</b> improved not only summer crops, but also the winter cover crop.
