25|$|CSR {{is known}} for {{impacting}} <b>employee</b> <b>turnover.</b> Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and {{that the ability to}} retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower <b>employee</b> <b>turnover.</b> On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces <b>employee</b> <b>turnover.</b> Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Employee</b> <b>turnover</b> rate is a {{significant}} problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, turnover rate among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to {{a substantial number of}} employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of the participants reported experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in <b>employee</b> <b>turnover</b> rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is {{a significant}} increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.|$|E

25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of <b>employee</b> <b>turnover</b> to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur action planning within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E
