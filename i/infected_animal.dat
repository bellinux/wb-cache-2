5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
25|$|Bubonic and septicemic plague is {{generally}} spread by flea bites or handling an <b>infected</b> <b>animal.</b> The pneumonitic form {{is generally}} spread between {{people through the}} air via infectious droplets. Diagnosis is typically by finding the bacterium in fluid from a lymph node, blood, or sputum.|$|E
25|$|Rabies {{is caused}} by lyssaviruses, {{including}} the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Rabies is spread when an <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> scratches or bites another animal or human. Saliva from an <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes {{into contact with the}} eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. More than 99% of rabies cases in countries where dogs commonly have the disease are caused by dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can only be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Transmission of BVDV occurs both {{horizontally}} and vertically {{with both}} persistently and transiently <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> excreting infectious virus. Virus is transmitted via direct contact, bodily secretions and contaminated fomites, {{with the virus}} being able to persist in the environment {{for more than two}} weeks. Persistently <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> are the most important source of the virus, continuously excreting a viral load one thousand times that shed by acutely <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} a severe {{bacterial}} infection on thyroid function rats were subjected to group A streptococcal pneumonia, and thyroid activity determined by measurement of the rate of discharge of I 131 from the thyroid gland. Decreased thyroid activity of moderate to marked degree was observed in the majority of <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> <b>Infected</b> <b>animals</b> ate less than normal animals. Since fasting leads to decreased thyroid function, I 131 release rates were measured in control <b>animals</b> pair-fed with <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> and in control and <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> force-fed a normal intake. The reduction in thyroid activity seen in acute infection was found to be partly but not entirely due to the associated voluntary food restriction. Although the adrenal glands of rats dying of pneumonia were very large, the thyroid inhibition occurring during the course of experimental pneumonia was not secondary to increased adrenocortical function since <b>infected,</b> adrenalectomized <b>animals,</b> receiving injections of cortisone, showed thyroid inhibition comparable to that observed in intact <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> The possible influence of the level of thyroid activity on resistance was evaluated. In two experiments a total of 80 rats in 3 groups was pretreated with propylthiouracil and injected daily with 3 dosage levels of 7 -thyroxine for 3 weeks prior to inoculation. Under these conditions mortality rates in <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> fell with decreasing levels of thyroid function. However, induced hypothyroidism was found to afford no protective effect in comparison with untreated <b>infected</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
25|$|Other virus {{transmission}} routes for arboviruses include handling <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> carcasses, blood transfusion, child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products. Transmission from nonhuman vertebrates to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod {{is thought to}} be unlikely. For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious.|$|E
25|$|The trypanosomes are {{injected}} into vertebrate muscle tissue, but make their way, {{first into the}} lymphatic system, then into the bloodstream, and eventually into the brain. The disease causes the swelling of the lymph glands, emaciation of the body, and eventually leads to death. Uninfected tsetse may bite the <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> prior to its death and acquire the disease, thereby closing the transmission cycle.|$|E
25|$|Ishii innovated bombs {{containing}} live {{mice and}} fleas, with very small explosive loads, {{to deliver the}} weaponized microbes, overcoming {{the problem of the}} explosive killing the <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.|$|E

25|$|Plague has a {{long history}} as a {{biological}} weapon. Historical accounts from ancient China and medieval Europe detail the use of <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the Xiongnu/Huns, Mongols, Turks, and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. Han Dynasty General Huo Qubing is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by catapult into cities under siege.|$|E
25|$|The {{three types}} of plague {{are the result of}} the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague is mainly spread by {{infected}} fleas from small animals. It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague <b>infected</b> <b>animal.</b> In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell. Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{instances}} where behavioural changes {{were reported in}} rodents with T. gondii. The changes seen were a reduction in their innate dislike of cats, which {{made it easier for}} cats to prey on the rodents. In an experiment conducted by Berdoy and colleagues, the infected rats showed preference for the cat odour area versus the area with the rabbit scent, therefore making it easier for the parasite to take its final step in its definitive feline host. This {{is an example of the}} extended phenotype concept, that is, the idea that the behaviour of the <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> changes in order to maximize survival of the genes that increase predation of the intermediate rodent host.|$|E

[...] As expected, the protein composition of the outer membrane differs when comparing Leptospira growing in artificial medium with Leptospira present in an <b>infected</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] Several leptospiral outer membrane proteins {{have been shown to}} attach to the host extracellular matrix and to factor H. [...] These proteins may be important for adhesion of Leptospira to host tissues and in resisting complement, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The FMD virus can be {{transmitted}} {{in a number of}} ways, including close-contact animal-to-animal spread, long-distance aerosol spread and fomites, or inanimate objects, typically fodder and motor vehicles. [...] The clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers, standing water, and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing <b>infected</b> <b>animal</b> products can harbor the virus, as well. [...] Cows can also catch FMD from the semen of infected bulls. [...] Control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock, and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease.|$|E
2500|$|The outer {{membrane}} of Leptospira, {{like those}} of most other Gram-negative bacteria, contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS). [...] Differences in the highly immunogenic LPS structure account for the numerous serovars of Leptospira. [...] Consequently, immunity is serovar specific; current leptospiral vaccines, which consist of one or several serovars of Leptospira endemic in the population to be immunized, protect only against the serovars contained in the vaccine preparation. [...] Leptospiral LPS has low endotoxin activity. [...] An unusual feature of leptospiral LPS is that it activates host cells via TLR2 rather than TLR4. [...] The unique structure of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule may account for this observation. [...] Finally, the LPS O antigen content of L. interrogans differs in an acutely infected versus a chronically <b>infected</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] The role of O antigen changes in the establishment or maintenance of acute or chronic infection, if any, is unknown.|$|E

Tissue pepsinogen concentration was measured as the total, acid-stable proteolytic activity present in mucosal homogenates, as well as immunohistochemically. The immunohistochemical findings were quantified using computer-aided image analysis. Elevation of plasma pepsinogen concentrations in <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> was of borderline significance (P = 0. 06). The fundic mucosae of <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> were heavier (P < 0. 02) than those of control animals, {{but there was no}} overall change in the pepsinogen content of tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed that <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> had increased numbers of zymogenic cells, due to mucous cell hyperplasia and the adaptation of cells to produce both mucins and pepsinogen. The pepsinogen content of chief cells, the major source of pepsinogen in uninfected animals, was reduced in infected lambs. Image analysis confirmed that at a mid-point of the mucosa of <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> there was increased pepsinogen-specific immunoreactivity that corresponded with areas of mucosal hyperplasia.

MethodsAnimals {{were divided into}} five groups: non-treated <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> (I); benznidazole-treated <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> (Bz; 100  mg/kg body weight, single daily dose by gavage); Canova medication (CM) treated <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> (CM; 0. 2  mL/animal, single daily dose by gavage); benznidazole- and Canova medication-treated <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> with the above-mentioned dose (Bz+CM); and non-infected animals (C). TNF-α and IL- 10 levels were determined in serum aliquots after 4, 7, 10, 13, and 29 days of infection. An ELISA technique was employed with R&D System Inc. antibody pairs. ResultsA high increase in TNF-α and IL- 10 levels occurred in the infected and CM-treated groups within the treatment employed on the 10 th day after infection, coupled with a IL- 10 decrease on the 13 th day after infection {{when compared with the}} other experimental groups.

40|$|The serum {{concentrations}} of aspartate amino transferase(AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT). phosphorus, urea and potassium increased in <b>infected</b> <b>animals.</b> The increased AST and ALT levels suggested pathology of the skeletal muscle and hepatic parenchyma due to haemorrhagic gastritis and fatty degeneration of the liver. An {{increase in the}} serum phosphorus levels in <b>infected</b> <b>animals</b> {{may be attributed to}} a reciprocal relationship with serum calcium and carbohydrate utilization.
