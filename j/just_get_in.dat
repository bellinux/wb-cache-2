500|$|In 1954, the 49ers {{compiled}} their Million Dollar Backfield, {{which was}} composed of four future Hall of Famers: Tittle; fullbacks John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry; and halfback Hugh McElhenny. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because I <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball," [...] Tittle reminisced in 2006. The team had aspirations for a championship run, but injuries, including McElhenny's separated shoulder in the sixth game of the season, ended those hopes and the 49ers {{finished third in the}} Western Division. Tittle starred in his second straight Pro Bowl appearance as he threw two touchdown passes, including one to 49ers teammate Billy Wilson, who was named the game's MVP.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{announcing the}} character's creation, BBC Publicity {{initially}} stated of her personality: [...] "Maddy's enthusiasm and ability speaks for itself. She's a young SHO who loves {{her job and}} is fun to be around." [...] Expanding, it was added that: [...] "Maddy's young, fun and up for a laugh while, at the same time, dedicated to her job. She's definitely {{not going to be}} single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which could <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the way..." [...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's says things I wouldn't. But when she cries, I cry and when she smiles, I smile".|$|E
500|$|For three seasons, {{the backfield}} {{challenged}} opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, {{the speed of}} Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. [...] "There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield," [...] Tittle reminisced. [...] "It made quarterbacking so easy because I <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the huddle and call anything and you have three Hall of Fame running backs ready to carry the ball." [...] They achieved their greatest success during their first year together, in 1954, in which they shattered the team record for rushing yards in a season. The 49ers led the league with 2,498 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns, and averaged 5.7 yards per carry and 208.2 rushing yards per game. Perry, McElhenny, and Johnson each finished the season in the top ten in rushing yards, with Perry and Johnson finishing first and second, respectively. McElhenny ranked eighth despite playing in only six games before being sidelined by a season-ending shoulder injury. Tittle, Perry, Johnson, and Detroit Lions halfback Doak Walker comprised the starting backfield in the 1955 Pro Bowl, and Perry was deemed the NFL's Player of the Year by the United Press. With the highly potent offense, many thought San Francisco was due to win a NFL championship, but defensive problems landed the 49ers in third place behind the Lions and Bears in 1954. Moreover, the offense struggled after McElhenny's injury.|$|E

500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield and Binaural, band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had [...] "four or five" [...] ideas coming into the sessions, and there was [...] "a lot to just kind of weed through and work on." [...] The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would come along and record his vocals afterwards, stating, [...] "I just sang it, that's the take." [...] Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone [...] "the anal-retentive side of you goes, 'I think I could play better.'", but when reuniting [...] "the entire band goes 'No, it's great as it is,' then you <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the mood and embrace it." [...] Gossard stated that [...] "the process of letting go is constant in this band", adding that bandmembers would arrive with [...] "a clear idea of what a song is going to be" [...] but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth [...] "Boom" [...] Gaspar on Keyboards, most notably on the song [...] "Love Boat Captain". According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was [...] "ready to go to Seattle." [...] According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being [...] "open to new things," [...] while Vedder stated Gaspar [...] "was able to find his place" [...] and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready {{said that he had}} always wanted the band to feature keyboards.|$|E

60|$|The Eagles came; this is {{the second}} time; I am glad to get them--Jeff, wait till you get four or five, and then send them with a two-cent stamp. I have not had any letter from George. Mother, have you heard anything? did the money come? Dear mother, how are you nowadays? I do hope you feel well and in good spirits--I think about you {{every day of my life}} out here. Sometimes I see women in the hospitals, mothers come to see their sons, and {{occasionally}} one that makes me think of my dear mother--one did very much, a lady about 60, from Pennsylvania, come to see her son, a captain, very badly wounded and his wound gangrened, and they after a while removed him to a tent by himself. Another son of hers, a young man, came with her to see his brother. She was a pretty full-sized lady, with spectacles; she dressed in black--looked real Velsory.[17] I got very well acquainted with her; she had a real Long Island old-fashioned way--but I had to avoid the poor captain, as it was that time that my hand was cut in the artery, and I was liable to gangrene myself--but she and the two sons have gone home now, but I doubt whether the wounded one is alive, as he was very low. Mother, I want to hear about Andrew too, whether he went to Rockland lake. You have no idea how many soldiers there are who have lost their voices, and have to speak in whispers--there are a great many, I meet some almost every day; as far as that alone is concerned, Andrew must not be discouraged, as the general health may be good as common irrespective of that. I do hope Andrew will get along better than he thinks for--it is bad enough for a poor man to be out of health even partially, but he must try to look on the bright side. Mother, have you heard anything from Han since, or from Mary's folks? I got a letter from Mrs. Price last week; if you see Emma tell her I was pleased to get it, and shall answer it very soon. Mother, I have sent another letter to the N. Y. Times--it may appear, if not to-day, within a few days. I am feeling excellent well these days, it is so moderate and pleasant weather now; I was getting real exhausted with the heat. I thought of you too, how it must have exhausted you those hot days. I still occupy the same 3rd story room, 394 L st., and get my breakfast in my room in the morning myself, and dinner at a restaurant about 3 o'clock--I get along very well and very economical (which is a forced put, but just as well). But I must get another room or a boarding-house soon, as the folks are all going to move this month. My good and real friends the O'Connors live in the same block; I am in there every day. Dear mother, tell Mat and Miss Mannahatta I send them my love--I want to see them both. O how I want to see Jeff and you, mother; I sometimes feel as if I should <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the cars and come home--and the baby too, you must always write about her. Dear mother, good-bye for present.|$|E
