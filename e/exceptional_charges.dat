Charge transfer at molecule–metal interfaces strongly affects the overall physical and magnetic properties of the system, and ultimately the device performance. Here, we report theoretical and experimental evidence of a pronounced charge transfer involving nickel tetraphenyl porphyrin molecules adsorbed on Cu(100). The <b>exceptional</b> <b>charge</b> transfer leads to filling of the higher unoccupied orbitals up to LUMO+ 3. As a consequence of this strong interaction with the substrate, the porphyrin’s macrocycle sits very close to the surface, forcing the phenyl ligands to bend upwards. Due to this adsorption configuration, scanning tunneling microscopy cannot reliably probe the states related to the macrocycle. We demonstrate that photoemission tomography can instead access the Ni-TPP macrocycle electronic states and determine the reordering and filling of the LUMOs upon adsorption, thereby confirming the remarkable charge transfer predicted by density functional theory calculations...|$|R

30|$|The {{capacitance}} {{values for}} the composites [20 wt% of CNTs and 80 wt% of conducting polymers (ECP), such as polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy)] strongly depend on the cell construction [109]. In the case of three electrode cells, extremely high values could be found from 250 to 1100 F/g; however, in the two-electrode cell, much smaller specific capacitance values of 190 F/g for PPy/CNTs and 360 F/g for PANI/CNTs had been measured. It highlights {{the fact that only}} two-electrode cells allow a good estimation of materials performance in electrochemical capacitors. The CNTs/PPy film shows excellent charge storage and transfer capabilities, attributed to the high surface area, conductivity, and electrolyte accessibility of the nanoporous structure [64]. The aligned CNTs/PPy composite film had an exciting combination of <b>exceptional</b> <b>charge</b> storage capacities as large as 2.25 F/cm 2 and improved device response times relative to pure PPy films. The superior performance of the composite relative to their component materials is attributed to the combination of electrolyte accessibility, reduced diffusion distances, and improved conductivity in the redox-pseudocapacitive composite structure. An et al. [110] demonstrated that the SWCNT/PPy (1 / 1 in weight) nanocomposite electrode shows much higher specific capacitance than pure PPy and as-grown SWCNT electrodes, due to the uniformly coated PPy on the SWNTs. A maximum specific capacitance of 265 F/g from the SWNTs/PPy nanocomposite electrode containing 15 wt% of the conducting agent was obtained. The addition of conducting agent into the SWCNT-PPy nanocomposite electrode gives rise to an increase in the specific capacitance by reducing the internal resistance of the supercapacitor.|$|R

They have recently attracted {{a great deal}} of attention due to their excellent performance, capability for multilevel programming, and suitability as platforms for integrated circuits. Herein, novel NFGM devices have been fabricated using semiconducting cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4) nanoparticles (NPs) as charge trap sites and pentacene as a p-type semiconductor. Monodisperse CoFe 2 O 4 NPs with different diameters have been synthesized by thermal decomposition and embedded in NFGM devices. The particle size effects on the memory performance have been investigated in terms of energy levels and particle-particle interactions. CoFe 2 O 4 NP-based memory devices exhibit a large memory window (&# 8776; 73. 84 V), a high read current on/off ratio (read I on /I off) of &# 8776; 2. 98 × 103, and excellent data retention. Fast switching behaviors are observed due to the <b>exceptional</b> <b>charge</b> trapping/release capability of CoFe 2 O 4 NPs surrounded by the oleate layer, which acts as an alternative tunneling dielectric layer and simplifies the device fabrication process. Furthermore, the NFGM devices show excellent thermal stability, and flexible memory devices fabricated on plastic substrates exhibit remarkable mechanical and electrical stability. This study demonstrates a viable means of fabricating highly flexible, high-performance organic memory devices. Novel organic nano-floating gate memory (NFGM) devices functionalized with cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (CoFe 2 O 4 NPs) exhibit excellent electrical memory properties owing to the superb charge trap capability of CoFe 2 O 4 NPs and the insulating nature of the oleate layer acting as an alternative tunneling dielectric layer.

40|$|Spin, {{charge and}} orbital {{ordering}} in various crystalline compounds {{have been studied}} under extreme conditions. The main techniques used were synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction. High-pressure conditions were obtained by using a diamond anvil cell and the Paris-Edinburgh cell. Changes in the valence state of BiNiO 3 perovskite under pressure have been investigated by a neutron powder diffraction study and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations. At ambient pressure, BiNiO 3 has the unusual charge distribution Bi 3 + 0. 5 Bi 5 + 0. 5 Ni 2 +O 3 with ordering of Bi 3 + and Bi 5 + charges on the A sites of a highly distorted perovskite structure. High pressure neutron diffraction measurements show that the pressure-induced melting of the charge disproportionated state leads to a simultaneous charge transfer from Ni to Bi, so that the high pressure phase is metallic Bi 3 +Ni 3 +O 3. This <b>exceptional</b> <b>charge</b> transfer between A and B site cations coupled to electronic instabilities at both sites {{gives rise to a}} remarkable variety of ground states. Furthermore, Rietveld analysis of low temperature neutron powder diffraction data shows that the structure of BiNiO 3 remains triclinic (space grp 1 P) throughout the temperature range 5 to 300 K. BVS calculations confirm that the charge distribution is Bi 3 + 0. 5 Bi 5 + 0. 5 Ni 2 +O 3 down to 5 K. The magnetic cell is identical to that of the triclinic superstructure and a G-type antiferromagnetic model gives a good fit to the magnetic intensities, with an ordered Ni 2 + moment of 1. 76 (3) μB at 5 K. However, BiNiO 3 is ferrimagnetic due to the inexact cancellation of opposing, inequivalent moments in the low symmetry cell. The effect of high pressure on the structural properties of (EDT-TTF-CONH 2) 6 [Re 6 Se 8 (CN) 6], a conducting, molecular, mixed-valence, π-conjugated radical, cation salt has been examined using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and a diamond anvil cell set-up. It has previously been shown that this compound undergoes a low temperature phase transition from a rhombohedral (space group 3 R) to a triclinic (space group 1 P) structure at ~ 150 K. This transition is caused by a charge ordering. A LeBail profile fitting of powder diffraction data revealed a change in compressibility at 0. 7 GPa indicative of a phase transition. This was confirmed by single crystal data which showed that the structure remains rhombohedral) 3 (R, up i to 0. 4 GPa but is triclinic) 1 (P at 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 8 GPa. Hence, high pressure, as well as low temperature, can drive the charge ordering in (EDT-TTF-CONH 2) 6 [Re 6 Se 8 (CN) 6]. The transition pressure is between 0. 5 - 0. 7 GPa at 300 K. The crystal and magnetic structures of the orbitally ordered perovskite KCrF 3 have been determined from neutron powder diffraction measurement at temperatures from 3. 5 to 300 K. A phase transition from a tetragonal to a monoclinic structure occurs at 250 K but the orbital ordering is sustained. Long range antiferromagnetic order of the A-type occurs below TN = 46 K and the refined magnetic moment for the Cr 2 + sites was found to be 4. 39 (7) μB.
