40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the effects of a}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> of origin as the EU’s Common Commercial Policy (CCP) {{incentive}} mechanism that affects the intraregional trade and transaction cost structure of firms engaged in cross-border business operation. The research explores how firms should frame their crossborder physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> of origin. The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth case study of effects of the ‘SAP+ <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> of origin’ on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/export transactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> oforigin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting too...|$|E
40|$|Striking {{a balance}} between trade {{facilitation}} and preventing trade deflection {{is the single most}} difficult challenge with regard to the issue of rules of origin (ROO). ASEAN ROO is already considered as among the simplest in the world and still, in practice, results fall short of expectations. Haddad (2007) made the following observations about the ASEAN ROO : (1) low AFTA preference utilization rate, (2) difficult compliance even for supposedly simple value-added rule, (3) administrative cost of compliance to prove origin acting as deterrent, (4) low margin of preference for goods traded within ASEAN, and (5) the bulk of intra-ASEAN trade occurring in commodities where preference margins are below the threshold that would justify the cost of compliance. Lessons from the EU experience indicate {{that there are a number}} of factors which could further lessen the negative effects of restrictive rules of origin schemes. This is related to the wide spectrum of ROO among the various East Asian FTAs. According to Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007), the burden of production costs induced by restrictive rules of origin can be somewhat reduced by allowing less restrictive cumulation rules (e. g. <b>diagonal</b> or full <b>cumulation),</b> allowing duty drawback, outsourcing and higher de minimis levels. Furthermore, administrative costs can also be reduced by more trader-friendly approaches, such as self-certification methods. The reforms in ASEAN ROOs are indeed heading toward the direction of less restriction and simplification as described by Manchin and Pelkmans-Balaoing (2007) : The relatively ample allowance for imports in the AFTA stems from the realization that for many heavily-traded products in the region, like electronics, production processes may be so splintered that the value of local content is often a small percentage of the products total value. Very early on in the formation of AFTA, it was recognized that the 40 percent ASEAN origin rule may often not be met in the case of trade in textile and textile products. In 1995, it was therefore decided that either the percentage value-added or the substantial transformation rule may be used by ASEAN exporters. The AFTA ROO underwent further overhaul, starting in 2003, when operational procedures were further clarified and simplified. In the same year, the decision was reached to adopt a change in tariff heading rule for determining the origin of the product as a general alternative rule applicable to all products which cannot comply with the 40 percent local/ASEAN content requirement, giving priority to sectors which are the subject of private sector requests and those sectors prioritized by the AEM for accelerated integration. As of last year (2006), the change of tariff heading rule is fully endorsed for four sectors : wheat-flour, wood-based products, aluminum products and iron and steel. Forging ASEAN in an effective regional economic bloc and eventually an economic community, however, would entail more fundamental structural reforms. The argument by the 2003 McKinsey report that market fragmentation lies at the heart of ASEANs competitiveness challenge is rather simplistic. Fortunately, the six projects currently being undertaken by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) address these fundamental issues. These studies deal primarily with supply side constraints focusing on enhancing the capability of ASEAN member countries to engage with each other and other countries more effectively and meaningfully. In the medium term, ASEAN member countries can push for an East Asia Free Trade Area that will consolidate the various bilateral and sub-regional FTAs and therefore overcome the noodle bowl syndrome. This would be a direct result of harmonizing the various ROO. It goes without saying that the ultimate or long-term objective would be an equitable and efficient multilateral trading system anchored on lower MFN rates under the auspices of the WTO.

This paper aims to investigate how exports of final goods are affected by better access to foreign intermediate inputs.

We exploit {{the introduction of the}} southern Mediterranean countries into the Pan-Euro-Med zone of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> which meant that foreign intermediate inputs could be used from more countries than before without jeopardising the preferential access to the EU. Using a fixed effects specification that controls for detailed levels of unobserved heterogeneity and multilateral resistance, we examine the effect of the new <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> possibilities on southern Mediterranean exports to EU- 15. We find a positive effect on both export intensity, the value of exports, and export diversification, the number of exported products.

40|$|In the {{emerging}} process of market globalisation, firms’ strategic options for optimising their cross-border operations have broadened. This paper presents a strategic framework for developing an appropriate strategic response of firms by relocating their production facilities and framing their operational procedures {{in such a}} way that they may, as eligible beneficiaries, exploit institutional incentive mechanisms available in a specific region or a host country. More specifically, in the paper we explore a strategic option for lowering firms’ operational costs through international operations by using the mechanism of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> of origin introduced by the European Union (EU) in its Common Commercial Policy towards selected non-member countries. Despite extensive discussions in theoretical literature on the conception of the rules of origin, only a few studies have explored the implications of this mechanism from the perspective of a firm’s transaction costs in international business. This paper shows that the ‘SAP+ <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> of origin,’ when properly conceived and implemented by a firm, can positively affect its financial performance. By analysing the cost-effect simulation of a selected household appliance producer in the presented case study, we then discuss the key strategic and operational implications for firms wishing to take advantage of offered supranational institutional incentive mechanisms...|$|E

In particular, we consider {{the impact of}} switching from bilateral to <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> when using preferences (instead of paying the MFN tariff) involving the respect of rules of origin. We find that relaxing the restrictiveness of the ROOs leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting. The empirical part confirms these results. We use the most recent techniques developed by Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2007) on highly disaggregated data (HS 6 digit) to analyse {{the effects of the}} introduction of the Pan-European Cumulation System (PECS). We find that PECS reverses the negative impact of strict ROOs on intermediate trade which turns positive as a consequence of introducing diagonal ROCs.

40|$|Rules {{of origin}} (RoO) are a central topic {{both in the}} Inter-Regional Association Agreement {{negotiations}} between the European Union (EU) and the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), and in the 34 -country negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a detailed mapping of the different rules of origin regimes in FTAs in Europe and the Americas, and to draw lessons from these regimes to the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations, in particular. The paper offers four recommendations. First, the EU¿s standardized RoO regime will play a central role in the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations. However, there is plenty of room for mutual tariff concessions. At the minimum, the EU¿s tariff preferences for Mercosur should approximate those provided to Chile in order to foster Mercosur¿s chances to augment its industrial exports to the European market. Second, the EU-Mercosur FTA RoO regime should incorporate general and sector-specific adjustment mechanisms in order to enable Mercosur to better utilize the preferential treatment provided by the EU. Third, Mercosur will need to further consolidate its common market in order to take full advantage of the RoO regime¿s likely provision of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation.</b> Fourth, Mercosur should make the most of its strategy of simultaneous trade negotiations in the Americas and with the EU by ensuring a high degree of compatibility between its two major future agreements...|$|E
