5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E
25|$|Based on the Fairbairn–Sykes {{commando}} knife designed by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, the Fighting Commando Knife, Type V-42 used a narrow-profile, double-edged stiletto blade made of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The process uses a {{salt bath}} of alkali cyanate. This is {{contained}} in a steel pot that has an aeration system. The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E
5000|$|It {{provided}} alternating {{layers of}} differing hardenability. During quenching, the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> layers achieve greater hardness than the medium carbon layers. The hardness of the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> combine with the ductility {{of the low}} <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> to form the property of toughness.|$|R

50|$|Cold Steel's swords are {{primarily}} made from 1055 <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> and Damascus steel.|$|E
50|$|Since {{producing}} <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> from {{wrought iron}} was very difficult, careful lamination of different alloys also served to conserve this difficult-to-make steel by using it {{only for the}} parts of the blades where it was needed. Many swords were made with the minimum possible amount of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> along the cutting edge, {{with the rest of the}} blade being made of low carbon steel or wrought iron. A thin strip of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> could be laminated between two layers of softer steel, or a core of soft steel could be wrapped in <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> The Japanese katana was often found with complex patterns of soft and hard steels; having 5 sections of differing hardness welded together to form the final blade was not uncommon. The end result would be a blade with a very high carbon edge (as much as 1.0%, equal to the highest carbon content found in low alloy steels in use today) and a softer spine. The very hard, but brittle, edge made the swords extremely sharp, while the spine gave the blade flexibility, so that it would bend rather than break.|$|E
5000|$|Nitrogen+hydrogen+carbon monoxide, {{cryogenic}} or purified (AWS type 6B): 70-99% N2, 2-20% H2, 1-10% CO. For copper, silver, nickel, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, {{medium and}} <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R

For brazing copper, brass, low-nickel alloys, Monel, medium and <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Oils {{were once}} {{exclusively}} used {{in part because}} the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> of the time, such as 1095, could rust using simple water-based solutions, and the term honing [...] "oil" [...] is used today even for water based honing solutions.|$|R

5000|$|The {{amount of}} ferrite that forms between the laths {{is based on}} the carbon content of the steel. For a low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> {{typically}} discontinuous [...] "stringers" [...] or small particles of cementite will be present between laths.

For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium and <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> and {{chromium}} alloys.|$|R
50|$|Scrapers are {{normally}} made from <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> There are many manufacturers who provide scrapers {{in a wide}} variety of styles. Many woodworkers prefer to make their own card scrapers by cutting them from old hand saw blades.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{technique}} was also employed by Scandinavian Medieval swordsmiths. The Mora knife is today manufactured {{with a similar}} technique. Today the traditional crucible steel is seldom used, but the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> is usually tool steel or stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|High {{speed steel}} tools {{are the most}} popular for use in woodturning, as the speed of {{movement}} of the work past the edge is relatively high for handheld tools, and HSS holds its edge far longer than <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> tools can.|$|E
5000|$|Noble gas (usually argon, AWS type 9): Non-oxidizing, more {{expensive}} than nitrogen. Inert. Parts must be very clean, gas must be pure.

5000|$|A {{sticking}} knife usually {{consists of a}} double edge pointed blade approximately six inches long. Blades are traditionally made of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> (such as 1095). Handles are simple, consisting usually of two hardwood scales riveted through the full, flat blade tang. Sticking knives generally lack any kind of guard.|$|E
5000|$|Materials used in sword {{production}} {{must meet}} or exceed MOD specification.

5000|$|The {{type and}} {{hardness}} of steel used is important. <b>High</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> (1060, W1, tool steels, etc.) generate sparks easily. Iron and alloys (like stainless steel, 5160, etc.) do not. The steel must be hardened but softer than the flint-like material scraping off the spark. [...] Old files, leaf and coil springs, and rusty gardening tools are common, re-purposed sources of strikers.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} nickel free high {{nitrogen}} {{austenitic stainless steels}} were processed by various mechanical processing and heat treatment conditions to study the evolution of microstructure at every stage of processing. About eleven steels varying in composition, {{especially in terms of}} carbon contents, were processed through forging, rolling, solution annealing, cold rolling and warm rolling etc. The microstructure at every stage of processing was studied. The hot relied condition, hot rolled and cold rolled condition gave deformation induced fragmented grain structure. The <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> in the hot rolled conditions showed banding and grain boundary carbo-nitride precipitation. There were also intragranular carbide prcipitation in some of the <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> The solution treated microstructure in all steels showed extensive annealing twins and the lattice parameter increased with carbon and nitrogen contents. Cold rolling followed by solution treatment lead to development of slip lines in the fully austenitic matrix due to strain hardening of the matrix. The 600 degrees C warm rolled condition showed grain boundary carbide precipitation...|$|R

Each process has its benefits and drawbacks such as cost and durability.|$|E
40|$|Dual-phase <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> (DHCS) are {{commonly}} {{known for their}} improved strength, hardness, and abrasive resistance properties due to co-presence of retained austenite and martensite at the same time. Retained austenite is a meta-stable phase at room temperature, and stability of this phase governs the response of DHCS at different conditions. This research paper studies the effect of RA stability on corrosion behaviour of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> {{after they have been}} immersed into 1. 0 M NaCl solution for various times. For this purpose, two different steels with different RA stabilities have been investigated. The surface morphology of the samples before and after corrosion attack was observed by secondary electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), along with the weight loss and Vickers hardness analysis. Microstructural investigations proved the preferential attack to retained austenite phase during corrosion. Hence, increase in the stability of retained austenite in dual-phase steels led to decreasing the weight loss rate...|$|R
25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance <b>high</b> in <b>carbon,</b> then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> with the <b>carbon</b> content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|R
