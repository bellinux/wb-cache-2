For instance, 75% of the raw-milk artisan cheese produced in Wisconsin is made in the Driftless region. This cheese is made from milk produced by cows that graze on pastures. The region is home to Organic Valley, the nation's largest organic <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperative.</b> Generally, organic dairy production fits best with a grass-based milk production system. In addition to winegrape production and wine-making, the region also is known for apple production, and a number of hard cider makers are about to hit the market with product. The region is historically known for grass-fed beef, and has great potential to market forest botanicals - especially mushrooms - to the 21 million people in the region, including the relatively nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, and Milwaukee markets.|$|E

However, a community cannot hold a deed, so the Creamery Society, a community-based organization, was formed to take over the building. The Creamery Square Association was formed to develop the Creamery Square project. A new Farmers' Market building opened in May 2006, and the Creamery building is now home to The North Shore Archives and the Giantess Anna Swan Museum. The Sunrise Trail Museum and Brule Fossil Centre will be components of this new heritage development.|$|E

30|$|Conversely, Finnish <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{operate in}} a {{traditional}} agricultural cooperative form, and two variants exist. The market is divided into <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{that are part of}} the Valio Group, in which the role of farmers is to deliver milk and to indirectly exercise ownership in the processing company through their cooperative membership (supply cooperatives). On the other side are <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives</b> that are independent of the Valio Group, which take care of the whole chain from milk processing to the marketing of products under their own brand name (marketing cooperatives). Our sample included two large supply cooperatives (i.e., owners of Valio group) and three smaller independent <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> which are referred to as marketing cooperatives. These definitions used in Finland are slightly different from the cooperative types in many other countries. For example in the USA and Canada, supply agricultural cooperatives are those that supply their farmer-members with farm inputs and related services. Here the term supply refers to the supply of farmers’ produce to the cooperative. Marketing cooperatives are generally defined as organizations that collect, process, package, and market the farmers’ produce.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Bahir Dar Zuria and Mecha woredas of the Amhara Regional State and aimed at assessing the dairy production system and constraints associated to milk production and the emerging <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in the districts. A single-visit-multiple-subject formal survey technique was used to collect data from 150 households (75 from each district). Mixed crop-livestock production system was found to be the dominant farming system in the study area. The major cattle breeds kept by farmers in the study area were local Zebu cattle and crossbred (Zebu x Holstein-Friesian) animals. The major feed resources were natural pasture (grazing), hay, crop residues and by-products of the local beverages Tella (Atella) and Arekie (Brinti). The major constraints to milk production in the study area were feed shortage, disease prevalence and low milk yield of local cows. In recent years, <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives</b> started to emerge in the area especially in the Bahir Dar district. Lack of market, low product price and less demand for dairy products especially during fasting times are the major constraints encountered by the <b>dairy</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> Thus, strong extension work is needed to educate farmers in the region and create awareness about the importance of developing the dairy sector.
