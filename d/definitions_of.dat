5|$|In October 2011, at the 24th CGPM {{proposals}} {{were made to}} change the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> four of the base units. These changes should not affect the average person.|$|E

5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then {{be used in the}} <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> units of measure in place of the IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> {{cultural}} science depends on the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> creative industries. The problem, however, is that unlike the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary economics, complexity science and new cultural studies, which are also elements of cultural science, the creative industries suffer multiple non-commensurable definitions.

5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Slavonia, as a geographical region, {{do not necessarily}} coincide with {{the borders of the}} five counties, except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them. The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> the region. In the north, the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a geographic region, but this excludes Baranya from the geographic region's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia. The western boundary of the geographic region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined through history depending on the political divisions of Croatia. The eastern Croatia, as a geographic term, largely overlaps most <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> Slavonia. It is defined as the territory of the Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, including Baranya.|$|E
