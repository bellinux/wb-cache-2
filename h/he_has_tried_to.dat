25|$|Sympathizers {{consider}} that Uribe had achieved significant {{results in the}} fight against illegal armed groups, allowing civilian traffic to return to many roads abandoned during the 1990s. They believe <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> implement macroeconomic measures to stimulate internal commerce, growth and reduce unemployment, although he has not passed important bills such as a structural tax reform. However, after his term was over, his closer advisors, among which: his personal secretary, two ministers, among others, were either in prison or pursued by justice as a consequence of illegal activities, and former president is currently being investigated for several issues.|$|E
25|$|Part of Lee's {{difficulty}} at Test {{level is}} {{that the benefits of}} his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.|$|E

500|$|Dinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film [...] The {{movie was}} a box office disappointment, with global {{revenues}} of $419.7 million, although film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage's {{role as a}} [...] "cutesy stereotype <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avoid". Later that year, he played the title role in Uncle Vanya (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College's annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus. [...] In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie I Love You Too alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.|$|E
500|$|Danish Muslim {{politician}} Naser Khader said, [...] "Muslims {{are no more}} {{discriminated against}} in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If {{you say that you}} are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry." [...] His concern has centred on the power of [...] "Islamism" [...] or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> fight, especially {{in the wake of the}} controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.|$|E
500|$|Janssen {{said the}} film is [...] "definitely played {{with a bit of}} a wink and doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Wirkola himself {{described}} it as [...] "a little more grounded" [...] and action-centered than Dead Snow. He recalled that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> downplay comedy elements: [...] "If you go too far, it can turn into a spoof almost...We shot a lot more than what is in the movie of course and it’s just balancing it when you’re cutting." [...] Speaking of graphic violence, he said that [...] "the first version we tested was for sure the most extreme. Some stuff stayed in, some stuff got cut out." [...] By August 2012, Paramount was reportedly test screening two versions of the film, rated R and PG-13, and the R-rated cut received the positive feedback. Wirkola said, [...] "I was afraid. I actually made sure they could never cut it to PG-13...We always {{knew it was going to}} be R." [...] McKay said that Paramount's Adam Goodman [...] "was perceptive enough to see the same thing and got behind it as well." [...] Wirkola said, [...] "The pre-production and shooting went very smooth, but the post-production was very new to me and how they do things here with testing and the studio." [...] He said about the test screenings in particular: [...] "I can see why they do it – there’s a lot of money involved and they want it to hit as broad as possible. But I think it’s a flawed process, I really do." [...] McKay said that Paramount executives might nevertheless regret the film's R rating.|$|E

2500|$|Crawford {{was born}} in Manchester, England in 1908 and arrived in Australia in 1924. As a playwright, Crawford was {{influenced}} by William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. He was also greatly influenced by the Communist Party of Australia and the ideals it stood for. In an article written by Crawford about Elizabethan Theatre he wrote that [...] "In the Elizabethan Theatre, Marlowe spoke with {{the voice of the}} radical intellectual. Shakespeare spoke with the voice of the people." [...] From the themes of the plays written by Crawford it is clear <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> emulate both Marlowe and Shakespeare.|$|E

2500|$|Early on, Pinsky was {{inspired}} by the flow and tension of jazz and the excitement that it made him feel. As a former saxophonist, he has said that being a musician was a profoundly influential experience that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reproduce in his poetry. The musicality of poetry was and is extremely important to his work. Additionally, Pinsky revealed in a 1999 interview with Bomb Magazine that he enjoys jazz for its [...] "physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote that the film [...] "has been so sharply reduced in scope {{from what it was}} in the novel and the {{backgrounds}} of its people have been so pruned that it fails to explain the whys of their troubles, into the middle of which we're suddenly thrown. This appears to be the fault of the writer-director, Philip Dunne. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> do too much with visual shorthand [...] [...] [...] He barely introduces his hero [...] [...] [...] before he is bouncing us through three disappointments in the fellow's fifty-first year and then having him meet a beautiful model for a brief and futile fling at romance [...] [...] [...] The production has class and distinction in black-and-white CinemaScope, but the drama itself lacks those virtues." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book's central {{crime is}} a murder, {{which takes place}} before the novel opens. [...] (This is an Asimovian trademark, which he {{attributed}} to his own squeamishness and John Campbell's advice of beginning as late in the story as possible.) [...] The victim is Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador who lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer, in cooperation with a highly advanced robot named R.

2500|$|Allusions to sectarian difference, {{widespread}} in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, {{can be found}} in his poems. His books Wintering Out (1973) and North (1975) seek to interweave commentary on the Troubles with a historical context and wider human experience. While some critics accused Heaney of being [...] "an apologist and a mythologiser" [...] of the violence, Blake Morrison suggests the poet has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance... Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however [...] "committed", can influence the course of history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{present state}} of {{knowledge}} about Kurdish allows, at least roughly, drawing the approximate borders of the areas where the main ethnic core of the speakers of the contemporary Kurdish dialects was formed. The most argued hypothesis on the localisation of the ethnic territory of the Kurds remains D.N. Mackenzie's theory, proposed in the early 1960s. Developing the ideas of P. Tedesco [...] and regarding the common phonetic isoglosses shared by Kurdish, Persian, and Baluchi, D.N. Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages form a unity within Northwestern Iranian. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct such a Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to his theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the province of Fars in the southwest (proceeding {{from the fact that}} the Achaemenids spoke Persian), the Balochs (Proto-Balochs) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern Luristan or in the province of Isfahan.|$|E
2500|$|The Dalai Lama {{has always}} been an {{important}} figure of the Gelug tradition. Although finding dominance in Central Tibet, the Dalai Lama has been an important figure beyond sectarian boundaries. The Dalai Lama figure is important for many reasons. [...] Since the time of the fifth Dalai Lama his personage {{has always been}} a symbol of unification of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions. This is significant, even though he had no formal or institutional roles in any religious tradition. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that the Buddhist values and traditions should be placed above the importance of any specific school. The traditional function of the Dalai Lama as an ecumenical figure, holding together disparate religious and regional groups, has been taken up by the present fourteenth Dalai Lama. He has worked to overcome sectarian and other divisions in the exiled community and has become a symbol of Tibetan nationhood for Tibetans both in Tibet and in exile..|$|E
