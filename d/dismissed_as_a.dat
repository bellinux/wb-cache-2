5|$|Glasgow {{escaped from}} the fleet of seven ships, {{although}} it sustained significant damage, and the battle is considered {{a victory for the}} British. Several captains of the Continental fleet were criticized for their actions during the battle, and one was eventually <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. Commodore Hopkins was criticized for other actions pertaining to the cruise, including the distribution of seized goods, and was also dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, a cinema {{owner in}} Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films, {{so as to}} screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI {{convention}} was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to be <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hoaxster, and the screening did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Circuit case of Saunders v Wilkins (1945), Saunders {{claimed that}} Virginia should have its Congressional {{representation}} reduced {{because of its}} use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued {{for the right to}} run for Congress at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political question.|$|E
50|$|The {{charge of}} alarmism can of course {{be used to}} {{discredit}} <b>a</b> legitimate warning, <b>as</b> when Churchill was widely <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alarmist in the 1930s.|$|R

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley Kamel) {{arrives at}} his office and finds Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) and Harold Krenshaw (Tim Bagley) arguing over who should get the {{following}} session. They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card broke apart, and as a result, the card was <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fake.|$|E

5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) {{is being}} sent on an {{interstellar}} journey {{to evaluate whether}} a decades old space station should continue to study the remote oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father (Nikolai Grinko) and retired pilot Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). They watch filmed testimony of Berton describing a four-meter-tall child on Solaris, only to have this sighting <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hallucination {{by a panel of}} scientists. After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{began playing}} for his home county in 1962 after topping the averages for Leeds, Yorkshire Colts and Yorkshire Second XI. In 414 matches for Yorkshire he scored 32,570runs {{at an average}} of 57.85, with a highest score of 260 not out against Essex, and 103centuries in all. He scored another 8,699runs in List A cricket, {{averaging}} 40.08. Boycott twice averaged over 100 in an English first-class season: 100.12 in 1971, and 102.53 in 1979. He is one of only two players to have achieved this twice, Mark Ramprakash was the other. Boycott was appointed captain of Yorkshire in 1971, but was sacked in 1978 after failing to win a trophy while in charge. He was then <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> player, but reinstated after a members' revolt. During his career Boycott frequently clashed with other strong personalities at the club, including Fred Trueman, Brian Close and Ray Illingworth, but remained popular with the Yorkshire crowds.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria {{across the}} centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, {{stopping}} at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys {{to other parts of}} England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest. She objected {{on the grounds of the}} King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Public Enemy {{released}} {{their second}} album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back to critical and commercial success. Their music's dense textures, {{provided by the}} group's production team The Bomb Squad, exemplified a new production aesthetic in hip hop at the time. The controversial, politically charged lyrics by the group's lead rapper Chuck D, whose braggadocio raps contained references to political figures such as Assata Shakur and Nelson Mandela, as well as endorsements of Nation of Islam-leader Louis Farrakhan, intensified the group's affiliation with black nationalism and Farrakhan. It Takes a Nations success helped raise hip hop's profile as both art and sociopolitical statement, amid media criticism of the genre. It helped give hip hop a critical credibility and standing in the popular music community after it had been largely <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fad since its introduction {{at the turn of}} the 1980s. In promoting the record, Public Enemy expanded their live shows and performing dynamic. With the album's content and the group's rage-filled showmanship in concert, they became the vanguard of a movement in hip hop that reflected a new black consciousness and socio-political dynamic that were taking shape in America at the time.|$|E
50|$|The Fisher Model was {{proposed}} in 1930 by Ronald Fisher. Under the Fisher Model, gene clusters {{are a result}} of two alleles working well with one another. In other words, gene clusters may exhibit co-adaptation. The Fisher Model was considered unlikely and later <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> explanation for gene cluster formation.|$|R

5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. <b>Dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Monet's use {{of colored}} shadows arose from color {{theories}} that were {{popular in the}} 19th century. German scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (17491832) published {{one of the first}} modern descriptions of colored shadows in his Theory of Colours (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by Isaac Newton (16431727) in his treatise on Opticks (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul (17861889) expanded on Goethe's theory with The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839). Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the art world. It is generally thought that Vincent van Gogh, Camille Pissarro and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work. Georges Seurat (18591891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of chromatic division, a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist Ogden Rood (18311902).|$|E
5|$|The tale {{has been}} often <b>dismissed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fable and Paul was {{conscious}} {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E
