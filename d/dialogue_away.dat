The proposal is developed by elaborating on how the method might be applied to Muslim-Christian dialogue. In according a central role to the pedagogical potential of the lives of exemplary figures within each faith tradition, this approach has the potential to move Muslim-Christian <b>dialogue</b> <b>away</b> from the abstract level of mere philosophical agreement and into a new phase of inter-religious conversation based on the values embodied in the lives of exemplary individuals...|$|E
40|$|Constitutional {{dialogue}} {{has become}} an influential concept to {{understand the relationship between}} courts and other the institutional branches of the state, with the primary focus being on legislatures. More recently, the place of dialogue within the constitutional literature has been challenged as vague; providing a potential to over-reach or overstate the judicial role and distorting the reality of practices which in fact shape the relationship between courts and other institutions. Critics have placed into focus the question: should constitutional scholarship abandon ‘constitutional dialogue’ as a way of understanding the relationship between courts and other institutions within the constitutional order? This article seeks to respond to this question by arguing that constitutional dialogue remains an important aspect of understanding the development of constitutional understanding about inter-institutional roles but does so by acknowledging the criticisms levelled against constitutional dialogue. Developing this approach, the argument made in this article seeks to recast the theoretical foundations of dialogue in constitutional theory by shifting the understanding of <b>dialogue</b> <b>away</b> from its normative and descriptive tethers. In its place, constitutional dialogue should be considered {{in the context of a}} philosophical understanding of language and the role that it plays to create constitutional meanings and experiences. Dialogue has a deeper and more significant register than a metaphor conveying a ‘conversation’, ‘communication’ or a ‘deliberative rationality’ between the institutions of the constitutional order—dialogue must be understood through the perspective of language as disclosing a world of common meaning and experience...|$|E

40|$|This sixth edition {{is written}} with student {{social workers in}} mind who are {{studying}} for their professional qualifications. While the book {{is part of a}} series aimed at an undergraduate level there is no reason that this should not be of interest to postgraduates and students and practitioners of other disciplines. It is hard not to see social work as under attack in the current climate with the abolition of The College of Social Work, {{the development of a new}} regulator which the government did not intend to be independent, with arguments about the value of generic and specialist training, ‘Teaching Partnerships’ potentially undermining the academic nature of social work, the Professional Capabilities Framework under threat from the more functional Knowledge & Skills Statements. All this is taking place in a climate of increasing demand on mental health services and unprecedented cuts to those services, overseen by a goverment who appears to see social problems as individual responsibility rather than the product of faulty societies. Now is the time to shout about how important social work is for people with mental health problems, to turn the <b>dialogue</b> <b>away</b> from poorly evidenced medicalised understandings pushed by the profits of the pharmaceutical companies, to reclaim personalisation as a way of giving power to service users rather than a cost-cutting exercise, and to understand mental distress in the context of an increasingly excluded and excluding society. Never has mental health social work been more important and it is time for social work students to stand up and embrace this challenge!...|$|E

40|$|In flamenco {{there exists}} a {{conversation}} revolving around ideas of authenticity and purity. This dialogue advances a claim that there is “true” flamenco. From this discussion I extract for my research the idea of truth in flamenco, as opposed to true flamenco. This idea of truth {{moves away from the}} traditional purity <b>dialogue.</b> Stemming <b>away</b> from the insistence upon a single ideal of correctness, this pursuit focuses instead on searching for genuine comprehension in the art, this comprehension affords clarity and truth. The concept of truth has been present in my mind as an artist for several years. I constantly seek to find a truthful and genuine voice in my creative journey. Though pursuing truth as an artist involves gaining awareness and skill in the technical, choreographic, and musical aesthetics that are central to flamenco, it also involves becoming familiar with flamenco in a broader way, by studying its history and culture. In this paper I describe how I and other flamenco artists pursue truth, purity, and authenticity in flamenco. I look at how researchers pursue truth by demystifying the origins and development of flamenco; and I look at people and events that shaped modern manifestations of flamenco dance, especially those that inspire my work. I finish by describing my work currently and placing my work within the history of flamenco. Dance MFAMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

2500|$|Pope Benedict's lecture portends {{a parting}} from the Vatican's {{previous}} policies on <b>dialogue</b> with Islam, <b>away</b> from promoting harmony {{at all costs}} towards more reciprocity; that is, he wants the Muslim world opened up for Christian missions {{in the same way}} that Europe is open to Muslims and conversion out of Islam to be a legal or social possibility. In this view, according to the Pope, the position of Christians in Muslim-majority countries must be improved. However, observers note that Europe is not run as a Christian state but from the principles of liberal secularism which can be traced to the Age of Enlightenment, which was inspired in part by the region's Christian principles though sometimes at odds with Church authorities. [...] It was also the Papal Fleet at the Battle of Lepanto that protected Europe's growth by preventing a massive Ottoman invasion of Europe in 1571. European countries must allow all people regardless of religion the ability to build places of worship due to the secular nature of European constitutions. [...] Some European countries disallow the wearing of Muslim scarves, something the Catholic church has condemned these governments for. One must also be aware that most Muslim countries are ruled by secular dictatorships, though many also allow Islamic law Sharia to govern.|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{expression}} is multifaceted – {{expression is}} determined both by a person’s reaction {{to an event}} and by the attempt to manipulate this expression for strategic reasons in social interaction. ” (Scherer, 2001). In this paper we present some thoughts on the relation between emotion, facial expression and dialogue that have lead us to develop a model of dialogue in which the social views on language use are hooked up with theories of the sociology of emotions and in which facial expressions are mainly studied as discourseoriented actions without loosing track of the emotional antecedents and consequences {{that gave rise to}} them or that they raise. 1 Emotions-Faces-Dialogue Traditional spoken <b>dialogue</b> systems abstract <b>away</b> from many processes found in natural, face-to-face conversations. The dialogues with these systems are turn-based, task-oriented and make use of limited input and output modalities. The work on Embodied Conversational Agents has been trying to move away from these limitation in several ways. First, by extending the communicational signaling to other modalities taking into account facial expressions, gestures and also posture and gaze, for instance. Secondly, by not only taking a task-centered approach to conversation but by also paying attention to modeling the emotion processes, the personality of the conversational agent, and the social context of interaction. A third theme that has received some attention as well is the move away from turn-based systems towards continuous interaction. All this has lead to systems in which more and more is modelled of the intricacies of natural conversations and the various ways that conversations involve the participants in this activity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} hermeneutical substructure to George A. Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s notion of catholicity. With ecumenism {{serving as a}} major theme in Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s career as a theologian, he was preoccupied with the theological diversity within Christendom that has impeded reunification of the church. At mid-career, he took up the postmodern epistemology, believing that this may offer a way past the logjam in ecumenical research and provide a way towards a visible rejoining of the plethora of ecclesial bodies that constitute Christendom. By making this move, Lindbeck {{has been accused of}} taking up antirealism and reintroducing foundationalism into his new hermeneutical setting. Two theologians, Alister E. McGrath and Miroslav Volf, make this charge based on Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s principal literary work, The Nature of Doctrine (1984). McGrath argued that Lindbeck mis-characterized metaphysical realism by generating a strawman fallacy of the system (i. e., failing to give adequate consideration of the role of interpretative frameworks in his presentation of cognitive-propositionalism and experiential-expressivism and instead presenting them as systems of direct correspondence) and thereby concluding that metaphysical realism is hopelessly flawed. This, then, opened the door to metaphysical antirealism as the only viable prolegomena from which to theologize. McGrath, however, argues that metaphysical antirealism is the system that is hopelessly flawed and that the proper solution is a reassessment of metaphysical realism. McGrath 2 ̆ 7 s reassessment shows evidence of Kantian categories. Volf argued that Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s system is flawed on two counts. First, it maintains a foundationalistic premise {{in the way in which}} it treats the absorption of the contemporary world by the biblical world. Second, it has slipped into a version of antirealism where the Christian faith has no external (ontological) reference point. Though Volf does not use the term, it is nevertheless fair to characterize his understanding of Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s hermeneutic as a version of foundationalistic antirealism. Yet, an analysis of the entire Lindbeckian literary corpus, with The Nature of Doctrine understood within that broader context, yields a different conclusion. It demonstrates that (a) Lindbeck is committed to a theologia crucis construct which provides the hermeneutical controls to which, postmodernity has been incorporated, (b) his 2 ̆ 2 new hermeneutical setting 2 ̆ 2 is therefore neither a form of realism nor antirealism but a hybrid that incorporates both (a middle-distanced realism), and (c) his 2 ̆ 2 new hermeneutical setting 2 ̆ 2 successfully resists foundationalism. Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s The Nature of Doctrine points to these three characteristics of his new hermeneutic, though deficient in clear argumentations. Therefore, McGrath 2 ̆ 7 s and Volf 2 ̆ 7 s charges against Lindbeck are false. Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 new hermeneutical setting 2 ̆ 2 therefore possesses currency in contemporary ecumenical <b>dialogue.</b> It offers. <b>away</b> in which the differences between such broad ecclesial bodies (e. g., Catholicism and Protestantism) can be reconciled and reunited without violating the integrity of their individual and distinctive theologies. Two applications of Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s system is explored in this dissertation: (a) in the world of academia, and (b) in the world of ecumenical politics. In the world of academia, Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s system requires a restructuring of theological curricula that incorporates the balance of both particularity and pluralism where an unending dialectic of competing theologies is generated, (i. e., a version of complexio oppositorum). In the world of academia, Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s system requires a unification of ecclesial traditions currently separated from one another. For such a unification to occur, however, key aspects of Christian theology needs to undergo a re-definition commensurate with Lindbeck 2 ̆ 7 s new hermeneutical setting...|$|R
