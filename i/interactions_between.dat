We show that the perturbation theory results in divergence of integrals for the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> an excited atom and a media of dilute gas. We considered the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> two atoms embedded in a dielectric medium. The non-perturbative method used in this paper shows that the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the atoms is suppressed due to absorption of photons by the medium. Now the integrals are divergent no more. <b>Interaction</b> <b>between</b> two media of dilute gases is considered for the case of high temperatures...|$|R

The design technique, implemented in multirate digital control, eventually {{allows us to}} separately design controllers for each subsystem without considering <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> them. The resulting closed-loop system with <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> subsystems being eliminated delivers the same desired closed-loop responses each subsystem produces, that can be expected in the design stage. By this we mean that the resulting controller eliminating the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the subsystems delivers desired closed-loop responses {{in the existence of}} <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> subsystems.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{significant}} <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> genotype and environment {{was found in}} all measured characteristics (Table  5). In addition, SWV and Py showed lower <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> genotype and environment than growth characteristics. Na’iem [12] reported that significant <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> clone and site was found in D and H of 16 -month teak trees planted at four sites in Indonesia. On the other hand, Indira and Bhat [21] reported that no significant <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> clone and site was found in basic density of 14 -year-old teak clone planted at four sites in India. From these results, when teak plantations are established in Indonesia, <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> genotype and environment in growth characteristics, SWV, and Py should be considered. However, further study is needed to clarify <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> genotype and environment in teak wood properties.|$|R

40|$|Electrostatic {{interaction}} {{is often an}} important part of the total <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> molecules. It depends on the electron density distribution in the participating molecules, which can, in principle, be determined by X-ray diffraction methods. A method is described to calculate the electrostatic <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> two nonpenetrating molecules by adding the pair-wise <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the constituent atoms. The molecular electron density distribution is expressed in terms of the densities corresponding with spherical atoms and deformations according to Hirshfeld's method. The electrostatic <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the various deformation densities is replaced by the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> the atomic multipole moments corresponding with the deformation densities.

We also tested for corresponding relationships <b>between</b> the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> cortisol and testosterone and ratings of men’s facial health and dominance (perceived traits that are correlated with facial attractiveness in men). We found no evidence that ratings of either facial attractiveness or health were correlated with the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> cortisol and testosterone. Some analyses suggested that the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> cortisol and testosterone levels may predict ratings of men’s facial dominance, however, with testosterone being more closely related to facial dominance ratings among men with higher cortisol. Our results suggest that the relationship between men’s facial attractiveness and the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> cortisol and testosterone is not robust...|$|R
