5|$|In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah {{traveled}} {{south to}} his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. Their goal was to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> but both of them contracted either malaria or yellow fever. Sarah {{died at the age}} of 21 on September 15, 1835, after just three months of marriage. Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for his life. In the month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using wall-mounted terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|Lewis Balfour and his {{daughter}} both had weak chests, so they often needed to stay in warmer climates <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>health.</b> Stevenson inherited a tendency to coughs and fevers, exacerbated when {{the family moved to}} a damp, chilly house at 1Inverleith Terrace in1851. The family moved again to the sunnier 17Heriot Row when Stevenson was six years old, but the tendency to extreme sickness in winter remained with him until he was eleven. Illness would be a recurrent feature of his adult life and left him extraordinarily thin. Contemporary views were that he had tuberculosis, but more recent views are that it was bronchiectasis or even sarcoidosis.|$|E
25|$|In the {{archives}} of the Salesian Congregation is a contract of apprenticeship, dated November 1851; another one on stamped paper costing 40 cents, dated February 8, 1852; and others with later dates. These are among the first contracts of apprenticeship to be found in Turin. All of them are signed by the employer, the apprentice and Don Bosco. In those contracts, Don Bosco touched on many sensitive issues. Some employers customarily made servants and scullery-boys of the apprentices. Don Bosco obliged them to agree to employ the boys only in their acknowledged trade. Employers used to beat the boys. Don Bosco required them to agree that corrections be made only verbally. He cared <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> and demanded that they be given rest on feast days, and that they be given an annual holiday. But {{in spite of all the}} efforts and contracts, the situation of the apprentices of the time remained difficult.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de Nuits latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with Burgundy wines from the Côte de Nuits and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
