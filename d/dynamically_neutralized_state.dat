The study critically examines the justifications for international and regional interventions in the cases of Liberia and Burundi through a social constructivist framework. The main objective of the thesis is to enhance the understanding of how sovereignty is interpreted during non-aggressive interventions, both from a theoretical perspective through analysis of official discourses and from a practical perspective through interviews with external and internal actors in the field. The thesis argues that it may be more fruitful for future studies to question the aim of these interventions, rather than ask how to improve them. The study finds that rather than reinforce the sovereignty, these interventions <b>neutralize</b> <b>states</b> subject to external intervention {{in the sense that they}} become dependent on external capacity to maintain their stability, thereby maintaining peace and order in the international arena. The conclusion is that these interventions remain both controversial and paradoxical and the stated aim of reinforcing the state's sovereignty is questionable at best.

40|$|Technical {{strategies}} like {{amino acid}} substitution and residue modification {{have been widely}} used to characterize the importance of key amino acids and the role that each residue plays in the structural and functional properties of protein molecules. However, there is no systematic approach {{to assess the impact of}} the substituted/modified amino acids on the conformational dynamics of proteins. In this investigation to clarify the effects of residue modifications on the structural dynamics of human prion protein (PrP), a comparative molecular dynamics simulation study on the native and the amino acid-substituted analog at position 208 of PrP has been performed. It is believed that Arginine to Histidine mutation at position 208 is responsible for the structural transition of the native form of human prion protein to the pathogenic isoform causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). So, three 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations on three model constructs have been performed. Simulation results indicated considerable differences of conformational fluctuations for Alanine substituted construct (PrPALA) and the analog form (PrPSB) comprising the <b>neutralized</b> <b>state</b> of the Arginine residue at position 208 of the human prion protein. According to our data, substitution of the Arginine residue by the uncharged state of this residue induces some reversible structural alterations in the intrinsically flexible loop area including residues 167 – 171 of PrP. Thus, deprotonation of Arg 208 is a weak perturbation to the structural fluctuations of the protein backbone and the resulting construct behaves almost identical as its native form. Otherwise, Alanine substitution at position 208 imposed an irreversible impact on the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, which leads to conformational instabilities in the remote hot region comprising residues 190 – 195 of the C–terminal part of helix 2. Based on the results, it could be deduced that the observed conformational transitions upon Arg 208 to His point mutation, which is the main reason for CJD, may be mainly related to the structural instabilities due to the induced-conformational changes that caused alterations in local/spatial arrangements of the force distributions in the backbone of the human prion protein...|$|R

This paper presents a new approach: transform arbitrary, and thus possibly insecure, programs into secure ones, without resorting to runtime monitors.

For the TiO 2 -terminated surface, the effect is explained by the passivation of dangling bonds, whereas for the SrO-terminated surface, the suppression is caused by the surface relaxation. Modulation of the VB states implies a more direct change in charge distribution, and thus the induced change in band gap is more prominent at the TiO 2 termination. Further, we show that both CO 2 adsorption energy and surface band gap are strongly dependent on CO 2 coverage, suggesting that the observed effect can be utilized for sensing application {{in a wide range of}} CO 2 concentrations...|$|R

We investigate the neutralization of NV^- and calculate the ratio of NV^ 0 to total NV (NV^-+NV^ 0) caused by a hydrogen terminated diamond with a surface water layer. We find that NV^- neutralization exhibits two distinct regions: near the surface, where the NV^- is completely neutralized, and in the bulk, where the neutralization ratio is inversely proportional to depth following the electrostatic force law. In addition, small changes in concentration can lead to large differences in neutralization behavior. This phenomenon allows one to carefully control the concentration to decrease the NV^- neutralization. The presence of nitrogen dopant greatly reduces NV^- neutralization as the nitrogen ionizes in preference to NV^- neutralization at the same depth. The water layer pH also affects neutralization. If the pH is very low due to cleaning agent residue, then we see {{a change in the}} band bending and the reduction of the 2 -dimensional hole gas (DHG) region.

Remarkably, a large class F^n_m of models of this kind, namely capable of dynamically adjusting the vacuum energy irrespective of its value and size, has been identified. In this paper, we carefully put them to the experimental test. By performing a joint likelihood analysis we confront these models with the most recent observational data on type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the high redshift data on the expansion rate, so as to determine which ones are the most favored by observations.

The murine macrophage cell line P 388 D 1 or porcine macrophage-monocytes isolated from peripheral blood were incubated with antibody-complexed virus.

Negative-strand RNAs were detected in both cell types, indicating that RNA replication had taken place. Cultures of P 388 D 1 cells transfected with viral RNA produced very low levels of infectious virus, and infection with virus-antibody complexes, followed by a brief wash with pH 6. 0 buffer to remove residual input virus, allowed the detection of low levels of productive replication.

40|$|Baroclinic eddies are an {{important}} component of the General Circulation which regulate the extratropical climate by transporting heat and momentum. An idealization of this feedback is provided by baroclinic adjustment theories (Stone, 1978), which envision a linearly <b>neutralized</b> mean <b>state.</b> Based on the Charney-Stern condition, most baroclinic adjustment formulations propose basic states with homogenized potential vorticity. In this thesis we investigate the degree of potential vorticity homogenization in the extratropical troposphere. We show that homogenization is only observed across a shallow region around 700 mb, and propose an adjusted state with homogenized PV at the steering level alone. We demonstrate that this state can be neutral under certain conditions, and investigate its relevance for the equilibration of an idealized model. Because of the role of the PV flux as an eddy forcing of momentum, it is illuminating to describe the equilibration in terms of the redistribution of momentum. This affects both the PV gradient and the steering level of the waves, but the condition of homogenization at the steering level is very robust. In the 2 D problem, a local balance can be written between the dynamical and frictional forcing of momentum. However, in the 3 D problem there is an additional redistribution by a remotely forced meridional circulation. To circumvent this difficulty, we have developed a momentum-based formulation that exploits the interchangeability of momentum and temperature for quasi-balanced stratified rotating flow. By rewritting the thermodynamic equation as a momentum equation, we eliminate the forcing by the mean meridional circulation and formulate a local balance between the eddy PV flux and the non-conservative forcing of momentum. (cont.) This introduces a new variable, which we call potential momentum. The circulation can then be described in terms of the conversion between potential and physical momentum. A major simplification of this formulation is that temperature and momentum can be directly compared. For instance, the surface temperature gradient appears as a momentum source, which helps ellucidate the role of the momentum fluxes and the so-called "barotropic governor" (James, 1987) for the baroclinic equilibration. Our results suggest that mechanical friction might prevent thermal homogenization at the surface. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|A {{considerable}} {{improvement in}} the crystalline quality of thermo chemically grown ZnO NRs with the treatment of high intensity plasma can be explained using the existing literature. In general, ZnO NRs grown by thermo chemical method usually consist of different surface defect states due {{to the presence of}} water and hydroxyl ions, and non-reacted Zn and O ions as interstitial defect states [20],[21]. These defect states probably act as amorphous centers and as results, the as-grown structures exhibit slightly poor crystallinity. Upon plasma treatment, these surface defect states probably released due to the bombardment of energetic nitrogen ions, which also induce the re-crystallization of Zn and O ions. Further, the diffusion of Ni ions into the core-lattice of ZnO probably <b>neutralizes</b> the defect <b>states</b> present in the ZnO NRs. As result, the overall crystallinity of ZnO NRs enhanced with the increase of nitrogen plasma treatment. On the other hand, a possible reason for the formation of Zn 3 N 2 phase could be unintentional raise in temperature during plasma treatment since nitrogen ions can easily replace the oxygen atoms at temperatures higher than 110 °C. Therefore, these analyses clearly emphasized that the structure and phase purity of ZnO NRs remains as same as the untreated nanostructures upto the plasma exposure time of 15  min, and the crystalline quality of 15  min treated ZnO NRs improved nearly by three times than that of untreated ones.|$|R

HSV was isolated in 61 %of the episodesand was HSV type 1 in all cases. Serum neutraliz-ing antibody to HSV was measured initially and 21 days after the onset of symptoms. All patients had antibody initially, but a fourfold or greater rise in titer was seen in only four patients. Lesion size and stage of healing were compared in patients with virus-positive episodes and those with virus-negative episodes. These two groups {{were found to be}} clinically distinct. Virus-positive lesions were larger, and the rate of heal-ing was slower. This finding provides the first clinical correlation associatedwith the presence of HSV in cold sores. The herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are ubiqui-tous agents that infect most people early in life. In population studies in Great Britain and the United <b>States,</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies to HSV have been found in 40 %- 90 % of adults [1, 2]. The primary infection probably occurs early in life, for by the age of 15 years, 90 % of a study population had neutralizing antibody to HSV [2]. In a recent study of university students, how-ever, only 30 % had neutralizing antibody to HSV type 1 (HSV-l), a finding suggesting that the majority of children from middle-income families may reach adulthood without antibody Received for publication March 7, 1978, and in revise...|$|R
25|$|Prior to the {{hostilities}} {{between the}} North and South, {{the majority of}} European maritime powers had declared the practice of privateering to be illegal by the Declaration of Paris (1856). According to the treaty, privateers of signatory nations were strictly illegal and if caught they could be seized by the ships of any other signatory nation and tried in that nation's courts. However, they were {{not exactly the same}} as pirates. Privateers enjoyed limited legal status if they did not murder and if they behaved generally according to the laws of their sponsoring non-signatory government. Thus acting, they were not subject to the death penalty as if they were rogue buccaneers. True piracy was a crime everywhere and the death penalty for piracy was accepted worldwide. In 1856, the United States had declined to ratify the Declaration, or Treaty, of Paris in order to preserve the rights of a smaller fledgling nation against the larger maritime powers of the day. Now Lincoln wanted exactly the same protection against privateers as the European powers did in 1856, which the United States had denied. As a non-signatory of the Treaty, Lincoln could have legally raised a call for privateers himself, but he had much to lose by engaging in the practice because it could have stirred the wrath of the greatest maritime powers on earth, Great Britain, France and Spain, whom he wished instead would join in condemnation of the Confederacy as an illegal government. The Confederate States had little to lose and much to gain if they could <b>neutralize</b> the United <b>States</b> Navy and force the world to see them as a respectable world power. Surely, they believed, recognition of Southern sovereignty would follow.|$|R
40|$|After {{completing}} the rehabilitation {{process in a}} closed institution, the individual is released. Social reintegration {{is nothing more than}} just the process of overcoming the ensuing oppressive situation. The individual expects help and change in their existing situation, and when these are not the case there appears humiliation which transforms into trauma. The latter can change into polytrauma and then a person com mit s acts against their own will, harm ing themselves. Social reintegration is an individualized process whereby an individual has a chance to me et a specialist who can <b>neutralize</b> difficult <b>states</b> and situations. It is a matter of time whether or not the person in the specialist’s care will respond with their humiliation to integration rationaliza tion. The question is if an individual will settle for being socially marginal ized, underpriviliged and pauperized, or – by rejecting these states of identity - will turn them into socially accepted behaviour. Thus, what is meant here is per sonal traits which are essential for the role of reintegration process perform er – on the one hand as a protector, educator and helper, and on the other one – as an expert and advisor. When establishing normative law and an in stitutional system, what must be de veloped is such solutions which would allow probation officers to perform the above functions. Consequently, the prabation officer, counselor or social therapist, as reintegration experts with appropriate skills and techniques, are able to bring about a temporal and interpersonal change in an individual. A new image and lifestyle of the person undergoing therapy will be shaped through the strategy of destigmatisation and overcoming stress, i. e. getting out of an oppressive situation. This is a methodical, targeted and organized process, which has specific phases: successful institutional rehabilitation followed by rehabilitation in the open system. Its aim is to prepare an in dividual to change their former image and lifestyle through developing rel evant competencies, knowledge, selfassessment and motivation. Given the above, there should be developed individual rehabilitation programmes, Le. offers of change. The word “offer” im plies that one person proposes changes, and the other participates in the process by jointly determining aims and tasks which can result in the programme implementation. In order for an offer to bring about a real change in an individual’s behaviour, there must be provided proper means and tools necessary to accomplish direct and indirect services of a formative and therapist nature. This can be don e by means of original rehabilitation offers. What is necessary {{on the part of the}} community, however, is a network of institutionalized specialist services as a response to honesty, diligence and usefulness, i. e. axiological paradigm of social identity which is really put into operation...|$|R
