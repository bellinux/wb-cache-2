Hence, the Scottish <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Protection</b> Agency was established as an executive agency of the Scottish Office with the resources of 230 staff, 20 coastal offices, 6 protection vessels and 2 surveillance aircraft.

25|$|The Canadian navy {{was created}} in 1910 as the Department of the Naval Service. The Naval Service {{integrated}} other marine arms {{of the government of}} Canada with which it had a common professional background and the objective of security in the Canadian maritime environment and national sovereignty. In addition to a combat capability, the naval service included the <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Protection,</b> Hydrographic Survey, tidal observation and wireless telegraph branches. Each branch, including the quasi-military <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Protection,</b> contributed their fleet of ships to the new Naval Service. The service thereby commanded a number of Canadian Government Ships (CGS) ships in addition to the two purchased Royal Navy warships. Initially, eight fisheries cruisers (under the command of Rear Admiral Charles Kingsmill), were brought into the Department of the Naval Service, including , the first modern warship built in the country.|$|E

25|$|After Bonaventure was {{decommissioned}} in 1970, all remaining Canadian Trackers {{were transferred}} to shore bases. This limited their usefulness for ASW patrols, and between 1974 and 1981 gradually all but 20 were placed in storage and the remainder were stripped of their ASW gear. The remaining active-duty Trackers served until 1990 on <b>fisheries</b> <b>protection</b> and maritime patrol duties.

In addition, NOR VTS manages the sealanes into Hammerfest and in Bellsundet.

25|$|During the 1980s the Coast Guard's {{concentrated}} {{its work}} on fisheries surveillance. A {{major part of}} this involved inspection of the <b>fisheries</b> <b>protection</b> zones around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Here Soviet and later Spanish fishing vessels were a major participant. The Coast Guard {{played a major role}} in assessing the amount of caught fish. In most cases where it found non-conformities the agency would issue warnings. In 1988 it carried out 1,273 inspections, of which 21 involved seizure and 16 were reported. However, written warnings were issued in 268 cases, and 106 oral warnings were given.|$|E
25|$|Decreased fish stock {{during the}} 1990s {{resulted}} in more strict handling of violations. At the same time cooperation with neighboring countries improved. Greenlandic fishermen started fishing in the <b>fisheries</b> <b>protection</b> zones in 1991. In exchange for a Greenlandic acceptance of Norwegian and Russian management of the Barents Sea stocks, Greenland was issued quotas. This simply escalated the conflict, with Iceland joining fisheries from 1993. They claimed the protection zone was not valid {{in accordance with the}} Svalbard Treaty. The issue peaked on 5 August 1994, when Senja seized an Icelandic trawler. In 1997 the Coast Guard carried out 2,192 inspections, issued 566 warnings and seized 18 vessels.|$|E
