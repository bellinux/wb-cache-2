The decision support system of equipping <b>farm</b> <b>machines</b> is able to aid managers to make scientific and effective decision. In this paper, the decision support system of equipping <b>farm</b> <b>machines</b> is designed and developed based on the related theories {{and the thought of}} prototype. The system chooses Delphi 7. 0 as development language, and uses three classic equipping methods to establish system models.

40|$|Contribution of {{mechanical}} inputs in farming is considered {{in terms of}} farm mechanization. Farm mechanization has helped in increasing the cultivated area and yield of major crops like wheat, rice and maize to 0. 4 %, 10. 4 % and 27. 3 %, respectively, by bringing barren land under cultivation. To study the present status of farm mechanization in all the districts of Punjab using GIS, data of <b>farm</b> <b>machines,</b> sowing area and wheat crop production was collected from Census Organizations for 1994 - 95 to 2004 - 05.

To analyze the combined effect of most common <b>farm</b> <b>machines</b> (tractors, disc plows, cultivators, tubewells and threshers) on cultivated area of wheat and its production, multivariate maps help by considering the sum attribute of these <b>farm</b> <b>machines.</b> According to maps generated; Central, Southern and Eastern Punjab have greater area under cultivation as compared to Northern Punjab except Attock and Mianwali and there is a great need of recommended <b>farm</b> <b>machines</b> which may help to increase the wheat production for the same area under cultivation...|$|R

The results of this study showed that the amount of energy per unit weight of produced wheat was in the acceptable level, also the energy index was high.
