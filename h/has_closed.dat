5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult.

5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre.

There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum and provide little choice. There is a good provision of hardware stores, fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office <b>has</b> <b>closed.</b> The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
