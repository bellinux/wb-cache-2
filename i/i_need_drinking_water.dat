40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Ungaran. The goals of this study are to know and to {{evaluate}} the potential spring to add <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> of Ungaran population. This study uses observation and secondary data analysis. The collected data are meteorology data, the water production of Municipal waterworks, the quality and the quantity of springs, the number of population and the customers. The result of the study shows that there are eight springs with the total debit 157 liter/ second or 6739 m 3 / day. The Municipal Waterworks uses 65 liter/ second or 5616 m 3 / day with the leaking rate 7 % or 5222, 88 m 3 / day and the rest is used for irrigation. The quality of spring is qualified for <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> requirement. The <b>need</b> of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> for per capita of the population is 136. 7 liter/ capita/ day. In 2003 the prediction of the number of consumers is about 20. 745 persons, so the total <b>need</b> of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> is predicted about 2835. 8 m 3 / day. The total <b>need</b> of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> added with the leak water is 3032. 36 m 3 / day.

However, if the number of customers is accounted {{based on the number of}} the population in the pipe sope (­+ 48246 persons), the Municipal Waterworks will not fulfil the <b>need</b> of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> for population, therefore it needs to add volume production of <b>drinking</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
