5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E

25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
25|$|Hearing or {{audition}} (adjectival form: auditory) is {{the sense}} of sound perception. Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that {{is the sense}} of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the inner ear, which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000hertz, with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> called deafness or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as vibrations conducted through the body by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.|$|E
