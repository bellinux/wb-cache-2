40|$|The {{influence}} of a corona discharge field {{to the quality of}} carrot seed (its <b>germinating</b> <b>power</b> and the separation of biologically viable seed) is discussed. The seeds were processed with a cylindrical electric separator. Several methods of the intensification of the <b>germinating</b> <b>power</b> were compared when discussing the {{influence of}} a corona discharge field to the germinating power: control seed unaffected by soaking or discharge; seed soaked in ordinary water for 24 h; seed soaked in ordinary water for 24 h and germinated by constantly wetting it; seed soaked in alkaline activated water with 11. 65 pH for 24 h and seed stimulated by a corona discharge field. Two methods were chosen for the comparison {{of the results of the}} seed separation: corona discharge field in the cylindrical separator separated the seeds into 4 fractions; seeds were sorted in the 5 % solution of NaCl into 2 fractions. The tests showed that stimulating carrot seed with corona discharge fields increases germination from 7 % to 19 %; grading of seed material by a corona discharge field in cylinder separator enables to distinguish 60 % of seed whose quality indicators are better than those of the control...|$|E

40|$|In {{three years}} of {{experiments}} at Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station {{in the use of}} formaldehyde gas for treating seed potatoes for scab, {{it was found that the}} gas greatly reduces the <b>germinating</b> <b>powers</b> of the tubers. The injury not only affects the eyes, preventing germination, hut also causes sunken spots about the lenticels. The tubers absorb the gas and retain it and thus are poisoned. In experiments with the usual treatment for potato scab, where the seed is soaked in‘ standard solutions of formaldehyde or corrosive sublimate, it was found that injury results if the tubers are soaked for more than two hours, the injury increasing with the length of treatment. It was also found that in soaking tubers in standard solutions for potato scab they should be placed in the solution whole and not be cut for planting before treatment. Cut tubers when treated for only two hours showed a marked decrease in germination...|$|R
40|$|Togwa, a lactic-fermented cereal gruel, {{is widely}} {{consumed}} in Tanzania as a soft drink or {{used as a}} complementary food for young children. Studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of togwa to inhibit growth of common enteropathogenic bacteria and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin production. Single strains of enteropathogenic bacteria were inoculated into the gruel {{at the beginning of}} the fermentation process initiated using three different starters: 1. starter culture (SC) prepared by inoculum recycling of a previous togwa batch, 2. <b>germinated</b> sorghum flour, <b>power</b> flour, (PF) or 3. a combination of SC and PF. The number of viable cells (CFU/mL) for each enteropathogenic bacteria was then measured from sub-samples collected at intervals during the fermentation process. The presence of LT enterotoxin in togwa was also determined from the sub-samples using the Chinese hamster ovary cell test. In a community study, the prevalence of enteropathogenic bacteria in rectal faecal swabs from healthy children was measured before, during and after consumption of togwa. Children consuming unfermented gruel were used as controls. At a paediatric ward, young children with diarrhoea were given togwa or unfermented cereal gruel. The influence of togwa consumption on recovery of intestinal mucosal damage was measured using the lactulose:mannitol (L/M ratio) permeability test. Age matched healthy children from a local maternal and child health clinic were used as controls. Results showed that combining a daily recycled SC and PF resulted in a faster decrease in pH and growth inhibition of enteropathogenic bacteria (p In conclusion, togwa prepared using a combination of a daily recycled SC with PF results in accelerated increase in acidity which is a key factor to the inhibitory effect to common enteropathogenic bacteria. This make such togwa to have a potential in inhibiting the growth of common enteropathogenic bacteria and production of LT enterotoxins. A regular consumption of such togwa could protect young children from being exposed to potential diarrhoea causing bacteria or being colonized with them. The recovery of intestinal mucosa damaged during diarrhoea was faster in children consuming togwa...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Vernonanthura discolor is {{a native}} species with {{potential}} for reclamation of degraded lands, and the manufacture of wood panels. This study has aimed to evaluate the process of maturation and germination of Vernonanthura discolor seeds, determining the harvest time, and conducting the germination test. A periodic monitoring of the reproductive development of sources of Vernonanthura discolor was conducted, located in the municipality of Bocaiúva do Sul, PR, Brazil; and starting from the anthesis, weekly collections of seeds were performed to evaluate the percentage of dry matter, <b>germinating</b> <b>power,</b> and vigor, {{in order to identify}} the physiological maturity of the seeds. In the germination test, two combinations of four temperatures (20, 30, 20 - 30 and 30 °C), and two light regimes were tested, seeking to define the best methodology and evaluation dates of the test. It was concluded that the seeds physiological maturity Vernonanthura discolor reached 45 days after the anthesis, when the maximum values of dry weight, germination and vigor are achieved. Germination test may be conducted on blotting paper at 20 or 25 °C with a supply of light, or at 25 °C in the dark, the first count being on the 13 th and the last one on the 29 th day after seeding...|$|E
40|$|Co-operative {{work with}} {{farmers in the}} study of sugar beet culture was {{continued}} during the season of 1892. This work was begun the year previous, in which year the station distributed seed to a large number of farmers, and in autumn analyzed 502 samples of beets, grown in 51 counties of the state. (See Bulletins 15 and 17.) Last spring (1892) the interest manifested by the farmers was much less. Only fifty-two applied for seed, and in autumn only eighteen of these sent in beets for analysis. Of the remaining thirty-four only three sent any explanation— which was in all three cases “a total failure of the crop. ” No doubt the failure of most or all of the others to send in beets was due to a like cause; for not only was the season generally unfavorable, because of the unusually wet and backward spring, but moreover the writer is convinced from his own trials with the seed that much of that which he sent out was deficient in <b>germinating</b> <b>power.</b> This statement is due to those who faithfully tried and failed to get a crop; {{and on the other hand}} it is but fair to the writer to state that he procured the seed for that of “the very best quality” from a company which imports and distributes large quantities each year...|$|E
40|$|RESUMO: Brotos de soja são vegetais de consumo direto, obtidos de grãos germinados, que são utilizados há séculos nos países orientais. Suas características nutritivas e a facilidade de produção têm chamado a atenção de consumidores do Ocidente. Sementes pequenas com alto poder germinativo e vigor são qualidades inerentes para produção de brotos. Na Embrapa, essas características têm sido contempladas no programa de melhoramento genético para obtenção de {{cultivar}}es de soja especiais para o consumo humano. O objetivo deste trabalho foi produzir e caracterizar a qualidade de brotos de soja obtidos a partir das linhagens BRM 09 - 10505, BRM 10 - 60599 e PF 133002, em comparação com a cultivar BRS 216, desenvolvida para ser utilizada como brotos ou natto. Os brotos foram produzidos em bandejas dispostas em câmara de germinação (25 °C e 99 % de umidade relativa). Sementes e brotos foram avaliados nos seguintes aspectos: teor de proteínas, lipídios, cinzas, isoflavonas, inibidor de tripsina Kunitz, ácido fítico, comprimento e peso dos brotos. As sementes da BRM 09 - 10505 apresentaram 95 % de poder germinativo, seguida pela BRS 216 (93 %) e pelas outras linhagens (88 %, em média). A germinação pela mobilização dos compostos químicos aumentou os teores de proteínas (8, 96 %) e de isoflavonas (56, 00 %) e reduziu os teores de inibidor de tripsina Kunitz (26, 91 %) e de ácido fítico (13, 78 %). A cultivar BRS 216 apresentou o maior teor de proteína nas sementes (41, 96 g. 100 g- 1) e nos brotos (47, 70 g. 100 g- 1). A linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 apresentou maior teor de inibidor de tripsina nas sementes (27, 56 mg IT g- 1) e nos brotos (19, 62 mg. IT g- 1); maior concentração de isoflavonas totais nas sementes (340, 10 mg. 100 g- 1) e nos brotos (406, 38 mg. 100 g- 1), e menor teor de ácido fítico nos brotos (1, 13 g. 100 g- 1). Após quatro dias de germinação, destacaram-se, quanto ao comprimento e ao peso, a linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 (8, 03 cm e 214, 36 g) e a cultivar BRS 216 (7, 31 cm e 140, 93 g). Entre as linhagens testadas, a linhagem BRM 09 - 10505 apresentou bom potencial para produção de brotos. ABSTRACT: Soybean sprouts are {{vegetables for}} direct consumption obtained from germinated grains, which {{have been used for}} centuries in Eastern countries. Their nutritional characteristics and ease of production have attracted the attention of consumers from Western countries. Small seeds with high <b>germinating</b> <b>power</b> and vigour are inherent qualities for shoot production. At the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation - Embrapa, these characteristics have been considered in the genetic breeding program to obtain special soybean cultivars for human consumption. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce and characterize the quality of soybean sprouts from the genetic lines BRM 09 - 10505, BRM 10 - 60599 and PF 133002, in comparison with the cultivar BRS 216, which was developed for use as sprouts and natto. Trays placed in a growth chamber (25 °C and 99 % relative humidity) were used for produce the sprouts. The protein, lipid, ash, isoflavones, Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid contents were analysed in the seeds and sprouts. The length and weight of the sprouts were also determined. Seeds of the line BRM 09 - 10505 showed 95 % <b>germinating</b> <b>power</b> followed by BRS 216 (93 %) and the other lines (88 % on average). Germination, by mobilizing chemical compounds, increased the protein (8. 96 %) and isoflavone (56. 00 %) contents, and reduced the concentrations of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (26. 91 %) and phytic acid (13. 78 %). The cultivar BRS 216 presented the highest protein content in the seeds (41. 96 g. 100 g- 1) and sprouts (47. 70 g. 100 g- 1). The line BRM 09 - 10505 had the highest trypsin inhibitor content in the seeds (27. 56 mg IT g- 1) and in the sprouts (19. 62 mg IT g- 1); the highest total isoflavone contents in the seeds (340. 10 mg. 100 g - 1) and in the sprouts (406. 38 mg. 100 g- 1); and the lowest phytic acid content in the sprouts (1. 13 g. 100 g- 1). After four days of germination, the length and weight of the sprouts were, respectively, 8. 03 cm and 214. 36 g for line BRM 09 - 10505 and 7. 31 cm and 140. 93 g for BRS 216.

En los cuales se instalaron parcelas, con una dimensión de 20 x 30 (600 m 2) cada una. En el sitio Uritusinga, se instalaron tres parcelas, con un total de 22 árboles; en Selva Alegre, dos parcelas, con un total de 26 árboles; en El Naque se instalaron dos parcelas, con un total de 24 árboles; y, finalmente en San Simón se instalaron dos parcelas, con un total de 25 árboles de Cinchona officinalis L., {{de las cuales}} se tomó el {{material}} vegetal, donde se evaluó el potencial productivo y calidad de semillas. El número promedio de frutos por rama fue de 52, 35; el número de frutos por árbol de 704, 38; y, el número promedio de semillas por árbol de 1 260. Para el análisis de calidad de semillas, se utilizó las Normas Internacionales para el Análisis de Semillas Forestales (ISTA, 2007). En cuanto a la pureza de las semillas de Cinchona officinalis L., en promedio fue muy baja 38, 04 %. El contenido de humedad en los cuatro sitios de estudio, en promedio fue muy alto (81, 96 %), razón por la cual se consideran como semillas recalcitrantes. La germinación de las semillas a nivel de laboratorio tuvo un mayor porcentaje de germinación en presencia de la luz (70, 5 %) y en menor cantidad en la oscuridad (50 %), con un porcentaje promedio de viabilidad del 0, 58 %, que es muy bajo, lo que demuestra que la semilla pierde rápidamente su poder germinativo.  Abstract:This {{research is}} {{a study of the}} production potential and quality analysis of seeds of Cinchona officinalis L., from forest relicts in the province of Loja; which they were identified in four areas: Uritusinga (cantón Catamayo), Selva Alegre (cantón Saraguro) y los sectores El Naque y San Simón (Cantón Loja).
