5|$|X-ray crystallographic {{studies of}} {{warfarin}} {{show that it}} exists in tautomeric form, as the cyclic hemiketal, which is formed from the 4-hydroxycoumarin and the <b>ketone</b> in the 3-position substituent. However, the existence of many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no <b>ketone</b> group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E
5000|$|The {{carbonyl}} group is polar because the electronegativity of the oxygen {{is greater than}} that for carbon. Thus, <b>ketones</b> are nucleophilic at oxygen and electrophilic at carbon. Because the {{carbonyl group}} interacts with water by hydrogen bonding, <b>ketones</b> are typically more soluble in water than the related methylene compounds. <b>Ketones</b> are hydrogen-bond acceptors. <b>Ketones</b> are not usually hydrogen-bond donors and cannot hydrogen-bond to themselves. Because of their inability to serve both as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, <b>ketones</b> tend not to [...] "self-associate" [...] and are more volatile than alcohols and carboxylic acids of comparable molecular weights. These factors relate to the pervasiveness of <b>ketones</b> in perfumery and as solvents.|$|R

5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary <b>ketone</b> levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using <b>ketone</b> test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three <b>ketone</b> bodies).|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes.

Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} <b>ketone</b> bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely.

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses <b>ketone</b> bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce <b>ketone</b> bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells.

40|$|<b>Ketones</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{functional}} groups, and ketone-containing compounds are essential in both the nature and the chemical sciences. As such, the acidities (pKa) of <b>ketones</b> provide valuable information for scientists to screen for biological activities, to determine physical properties or to study reaction mechanisms. Direct measurements of pKa of <b>ketones</b> are not readily available due to their extremely weak acidity. Hence, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model that can predict the acidities of <b>ketones</b> and their acidity order is highly desirable. The establishment of an acidity scale in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution by Bordwell et al. made such an effort possible. By utilizing the pKa values of forty-eight <b>ketones</b> determined in DMSO as the training set, a QSPR model for predicting acidities of <b>ketones</b> was built by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. The established model showed statistical significance and predictive power (r 2 = 0. 91, q 2 = 0. 86, s = 1. 42). Moreover, the QSPR model also gave reasonable acidity predictions for five <b>ketones</b> in an external prediction set that were not included in the model generation phase (r 2 = 0. 92, s = 1. 618). Overall, the reported QSPR model for predicting acidities of <b>ketones</b> provides a useful tool for both biologists and chemists in understanding the biophysical properties and reaction rates of different classes of <b>ketones...</b>|$|R
