50|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>ether</b> has {{the unfortunate}} {{disadvantage}} of being extremely flammable, {{especially in the}} presence of enriched oxygen mixtures. This property has resulted in many instances of fires and even explosions in operating rooms during surgery.

40|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>ether</b> is {{a common}} {{industrial}} reagent and medical anesthetic. It is necessary to carry out real-time monitoring of this molecule due to its harmful effects on human health. In this paper, a highly sensitive <b>diethyl</b> <b>ether</b> SnO 2 gas-sensing material has been prepared by a sol-gel method. The gas sensitivity was tested by a home-made gas-sensing equipment. The surface adsorption and reaction processes between the SnO 2 gas-sensing film and the <b>diethyl</b> <b>ether</b> have been studied by in situ diffuse-reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (DRFT-IR) at different temperatures.
