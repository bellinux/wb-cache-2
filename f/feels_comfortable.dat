5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly <b>feels</b> <b>comfortable</b> with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E

[...] The stimuli can range from commonly feared situations and objects, such as heights or speaking publicly, to seemingly mundane objects and places that have become distressing through a traumatic experience. If someone is exposed to a traumatic experience it is common that being exposed to reminders, including memories, of the event will trigger anxiety attacks, emotional distress and flashbacks. A common mechanism {{to deal with these}} potential triggers is to avoid thinking about them and to avoid situations where they may be exposed to them. This can affect quality of life by limiting where someone feels they can go and what a person <b>feels</b> <b>comfortable</b> doing.

2500|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is heard is the moment when Belle and the Beast's true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beast's castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he <b>feels</b> <b>comfortable,</b> he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters' psyches. From the Beast's perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he wants to tell Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "add another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the song's role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the film's executive producer, former Head of Disney's film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie where you see what's on the screen and go, 'Wow-IEE'"; this ultimately became the film's ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers' desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belle's skirt as the couple danced past it.|$|E
