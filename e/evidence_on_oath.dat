[...] "I am satisfied," [...] he went on, [...] "that {{there is no evidence}} at all against the prisoner except the story of a spy, who says she believes her to be a vagrant heretic of bad character who escaped from the stake several years ago in the neighbourhood of Brussels, whither it is scarcely worth while to send to inquire about the matter. So that charge may drop. There remains the question as to whether or no the prisoner uttered certain words this afternoon, which, if she did utter them, are undoubtedly worthy of the death that, under my authority as acting commandant of this town, I have power to inflict. This question I foresaw, and that is why I asked the Senora, to whom the woman is alleged to have spoken the words, to accompany me here to give evidence. She has done so, and her <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> as against the statement of a spy woman not on oath, is that no such words were spoken. This being so, as the Senora is a good Catholic whom I have no reason to disbelieve, I order the release of the prisoner, whom for my part I take for nothing more than a crazy and harmless wanderer." ...|$|E
6000|$|The documents, whether {{contemporary}} {{or written}} later by contemporaries, contain {{none of the}} references to visions of St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and St. Michael, which we find in Jeanne's own replies at Rouen. For this omission {{it is not easy}} to account, even if we suppose that, except when giving <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath,</b> the Maid was extremely reticent. That she was reticent, we shall prove from evidence of d'Aulon and Dunois. Turning to the Maid's own evidence in court (1431) we must remember that she was most averse to speaking at all, that she often asked leave to wait for advice and permission from her voices before replying, that on one point she constantly declared that, if compelled to speak, she would not speak the truth. This point was the King's secret. There is absolutely contemporary evidence, from Alain Chartier, that, before she was accepted, she told Charles SOMETHING which filled him with surprise, joy, and belief.* The secret was connected with Charles's doubts of his own legitimacy, and Jeanne at her trial was driven to obscure the truth in a mist of allegory, as, indeed, she confessed. Jeanne's extreme reluctance to adopt even this loyal and laudable evasion is the measure of her truthfulness in general. Still, she did say some words which, as they stand, it is difficult to believe, to explain, or to account for. From any other prisoner, so unjustly menaced with a doom so dreadful, from Mary Stuart, for example, at Fotheringay, we do not expect the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The Maid is a witness of another kind, and where we cannot understand her, we must say, like herself, passez outre! ...|$|E
60|$|So says Feuerbach, in 1832. What he {{does not}} say is whence he got his {{information}} as to Kaspar's earliest exploits. Now our earliest <b>evidence,</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath,</b> before a magistrate, is dated November 4, 1829. George Weichmann, shoemaker (Feuerbach's anonymous 'citizen'), then swore that, on May 26, 1828, he saw Kaspar, not making paralysed efforts to walk, but trudging down a hilly street, shouting 'Hi!' ('or any loud cry'), and presently asking, 'with tolerable distinctness,' 'New Gate Street?' He took the boy that way, and the boy gave him the letter for the captain. Weichmann {{said that they had}} better ask for him at the New Gate Guard House, and the boy said 'Guard House? Guard House? New Gate no doubt just built?' He said he came from Ratisbon, and was in Nuremberg for the first time, but clearly did not understand what Weichmann meant when he inquired as to the chances of war breaking out. In May 1834 Weichmann repeated his evidence as to Kaspar's power of talking and walking, and was corroborated by one Jacob Beck, not heard of in 1829. On December 20, 1829, Merk, the captain's servant, spoke to Kaspar's fatigue, 'he reeled as he walked,' and would answer no questions. In 1834 Merk expanded, and said 'we had a long chat.' Kaspar averred that he could read and write, and had crossed the frontier daily on his way to school. 'He did not know where he came from.' Certainly Merk, in 1834, remembered much more than in 1829. Whether he suppressed facts in 1829, or, in 1834, invented fables, we do not know. The cavalry captain (November 2, 1829) remembered several intelligent remarks made by Kaspar. His dress was new and clean (denied by Feuerbach), he was tired and footsore. The evidence of the police, taken in 1834, was remote in time, but went to prove that Kaspar's eyesight and power of writing were normal. Feuerbach absolutely discredits all the sworn evidence of 1829, without giving his own sources. The early evidence shows that Kaspar could both walk and talk, and see normally, by artificial and natural light, all of which is absolutely inconsistent with Kaspar's later account of himself.|$|E

On the ordinary hypothesis, that Shakespeare was a man of genius, there is, then, nothing impossible in his knowledge, while his wildly daring anachronisms could have presented no temptation to a well-regulated scientific intellect like that of Bacon. The Baconian hypothesis rests on the incredulity with which dulness regards genius. We see the phenomenon every day when stupid people talk about people of ordinary cleverness, and 'wonder with a foolish face of praise.'

50|$|It {{seems that}} under the Nigerian Penal Code, for a witness to be prosecuted for giving false evidence, his {{testimony}} must be {{required by law to}} be <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> and, such testimony may be verbal or otherwise. But having regard to section 36 of the same Penal Code as noted earlier, evidence given under an affirmation or solemn declaration is also regarded as <b>evidence</b> given <b>on</b> <b>oath.</b> In interpreting the term ‘By an oath’ under section 191 of the Indian Penal Code, which has same wording with section 156 of the Penal Code, Thakore and Vakil apparently referring to an Indian court’s decision, argued that an oath or solemn affirmation is not a sine qua non to the offence of perjury or giving false evidence. This reasoning may be correct but it is submitted that such a person must either legally be bound by an oath or by express provision of the law to state the truth or must be bound by law to make declaration. If otherwise, it is doubtful if a court of justice under the Nigerian Penal Code jurisdiction can reasonably find an accused guilty for the offence of giving false evidence for statements not made under those circumstances.|$|R

50|$|The above {{notwithstanding}} {{the position of}} the law by virtue of section 1 (2) of the English Perjury Act and, section 9 of the Penal Code, is that while evidence could only he held to have been given in a judicial proceedings, if it was given before a body authorized to receive and examine <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath,</b> such a consideration is immaterial under section 113 of the Criminal Code. In the English case of Shaw where licensing justices held a special preliminary meeting for which there was no statutory authority, they had no power to administer an oath, the proceeding was held not to be judicial one. Equally, where an oath was administered on a witness by a person authorized by law to do so, there can be no perjury, if that person subsequently withdrew. This was decided in Lloyd where a witness was sworn in bankruptcy before a county court registrar, but examined in another room {{in the absence of the}} registrar; no perjury was committed in the absence of the registrar who had the competence to receive <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|E

The trial itself is preceded by 'the scrutiny' in which the ballot papers are examined by an officer of the court (or, in rare cases, by the court itself) in order to establish a factual basis for the trial. The scrutiny may be attended by the parties and their lawyers, who can make representations to the person carrying out the scrutiny.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the right}} to silence was not always a {{practical}} reality for all accused in the English courts for some period afterwards. With limited access to legal counsel (often depending on the social status of the accused), a shifting standard of proof, and a system generally distrustful of silent defendants, a criminal accused who remained silent was often believed to be guilty and got sentenced. Nevertheless, it remained a basic right available to the accused and has been an accepted practice {{over the past few}} centuries. In England, the practice of judicial questioning of accused persons at trial (as distinct from questioning prior to trial), did not really disappear until well into the 18th century. But by the 19th century, the accused was not allowed to give <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> even if they wanted to - also said to be a reaction to the inequities of the Star Chamber and High Commission.|$|E

[...] There was a widespread public outcry at the conditions depicted by the testimony heard. Parliament, however, declined to legislate {{on the basis of}} the report: even Sadler’s parliamentary friends, such as Lord Morpeth, conceded that the proceedings of the Committee were irregular and its choice of witnesses unbalanced. Instead, it voted for a fresh inquiry by means of a Factory Commission, visiting the principal manufacturing districts and taking <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> (unlike the Select Committee).|$|E

The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (gwybyddiaid). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.|$|R

As a result, some students received terrible progress ranks but excellent conduct marks. Niblock was very severe when it came to discipline. Suspensions and expulsions were very common, with some students taken out of the School for the punishments they received. When a severe 'crime' was committed the School became a Court of Justice, with culprits becoming 'the accused' and taking <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath.</b> One case saw eight witnesses called to the stand, and a resulting verdict of guilt, with a punishment of suspension - to satisfy the Trustees - and then expulsion upon two boys; one of these boys was found to have committed the crime of [...] "affrontery", and he was expelled for good.

At the time I gave this evidence in court, I knew it was wrong and against the law but I {{just wanted to get}} back at Dominic (i.e. Nora Wall) I was also afraid to pull back on my evidence because I thought that once I had made a statement I had to give evidence in court. The reason why I wanted to get back at Dominic was because she used to physically beat me when I was living the Group Homes. She gave me a terrible life and I hated her.

5000|$|In Anglo-Saxon legal procedure, the offence {{of perjury}} {{could only be}} {{committed}} by both jurors and by compurgators. With time witnesses {{began to appear in}} court they were not so treated despite the fact that their functions were akin to that of modern witnesses. This was {{due to the fact that}} their role were not yet differentiated from those of the juror - hence false evidence or perjury by witnesses was not made a crime. Even in the fourteenth century when witnesses started appearing before the jury to testify, perjury by them was not made a punishable offence. The maxim then was that every witness’s <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> was true. [...] Perjury by witnesses began to be punished before the end of fifteenth century by the Star Chamber. The immunity enjoyed by witnesses began also to be whittled down or interfered with by the parliament in England in 1540 with subornation of perjury and, in 1562, with perjury proper. The punishment for the offence then was in the nature of monetary penalty, recoverable in a civil action and, not by penal sanction. In 1613, the Star Chamber declared perjury by a witness to be a punishable offence at common law.|$|E

When a health {{authority}} found that a bogus doctor had operated {{on a number of}} patients it decided not to inform them that their operations had been performed by the 'doctor'. A complaint was made by the Patients' Association, however Clothier did not investigate on the grounds that {{there was no evidence that}} the Association was asked to complain on by any aggrieved individuals. [...] Clothier also handled a case in which a local councillor had received an anonymous leaflet supporting fluoridation of water. It transpired, after four months, that the leaflet had emanated from the local health authority. Clothier concluded that the authorship of the leaflet should have been disclosed without delay. He understood that the councillor wished to know what Jove-like hand had sent the leaflet. His verdict on the leaflet itself was damning. It was a very poor production and far below the standard I would expect an Authority to achieve in communication with the public. The shame at producing the hopeless leaflet did not excuse the subsequent administrative ineptitudes, to which only Franz Kafka could do justice. The whole episode has been a very great waste of my time and everyone else's. [...] One of the most serious cases investigated by Clothier concerned a complaint from a mother that her baby was born dead due to a catalogue of failures in maternity care at the hospital. Clothier decided for the first time since the establishment of the Office to hold a formal hearing and take <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath.</b> Clothier concluded that the midwives who gave evidence were untruthful. The complainant was shamefully neglected at her time of need and that records of routine checks had been falsified. Clothier concluded that it was difficult to imagine a more serious failure in the service as the health authority admitted that the baby could have survived if reasonable care had been given to the mother.|$|E
40|$|Oath-taking is an {{integral}} part of my professional life; oaths are used almost as a tool of trade, and are accepted as guarantees of truth. Whilst there is now a statutory right to affirm, instead of to swear, an affirmation itself constitutes a formula, an asseveration to tell the truth. Zeeman J, in the case of R v Mansell decided in 1993, declined to accept <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> from a child aged twelve years because he held inter alia that the child "[had] no notion of the nature or obligation of an oath in the sense that he [had] no understanding of what it is to swear to tell the truth or promising God to tell the truth and has no expectation that God will reward or punish in this world or the next". (1) Whilst His Honour's decision was overturned on appeal, the case demonstrates that oath-taking is fundamental to our legal system and its function in society.

Questions were raised over the independence of a process convened by the Home Secretary, to investigate apparent failures {{on the part of}} institutions, which would include scrutinising the actions of a former Home Secretary in handling allegations of child sexual abuse in the past.

40|$|The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission was {{established}} by the South Australian Government on 19 March 2015 to undertake an independent and comprehensive investigation into the potential for increasing South Australia’s participation in the nuclear fuel cycle. It was required to, and did, report to the Governor of South Australia by 6 May 2016. Former Governor of South Australia, Rear Admiral the Honourable Kevin Scarce AC CSC RAN (Rtd), {{was appointed to the}} role of Royal Commissioner on 9 February 2015. The Commission’s task was to prepare a considered report to government to inform future decision-making. The Commission determined that its process would be: 	evidence-based – meaning that it was concerned with facts and identifying the basis for claims made, 	open and transparent – enabling interested parties to provide evidence, watch evidence being given, consider and comment on the Commission’s tentative findings, and scrutinise the basis for its findings 	independent – forming its views independent of government, industry and lobby groups. The Commission collected evidence from four sources: written submissions, oral evidence in public sessions, its own research including overseas site visits, and commissioned studies. In May 2015, the Commission released four issues papers (focused on exploration and mining, further processing, electricity generation, and storage and disposal of waste), which provided background information related to its Terms of Reference and invited interested persons to respond to questions. People and organisations were given three months to make written submissions on oath as evidence for the Commission to consider. The Commission received more than 250 submissions from the community, organisations, industry and government. Anyone who contacted the Commission seeking help to comply with its process was assisted. At the outset the Commission made public that it would, by arrangement, receive submissions by other means. As a result, it took several oral submissions. The Commission also engaged regularly with Aboriginal communities, including through public information sessions. The Commission held a series of public sessions from September to December 2015, and in April 2016, on topics of interest to it. In those sessions it received oral <b>evidence</b> <b>on</b> <b>oath</b> from persons with relevant experience and expertise. The public sessions were conducted informally, with a view to encouraging discussion with witnesses on central topics to draw out information of particular relevance. Most public sessions were conducted in the Commission’s session room in Adelaide, and all sessions were streamed live on the Commission’s website. Transcripts and videos were later made available to be downloaded from the website. Over 37 sitting days, the Commission heard from 132 witnesses from Australia and overseas, including from Belgium, Canada, Finland, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The Commission engaged organisations with expertise to undertake detailed assessments of the potential commercial viability of establishing nuclear facilities in South Australia. It also sought analysis that considered the wider economic effects of investments made in developing those facilities. It commissioned expert assessments in relation to fuel leasing, the risks of transporting used fuel, how safety cases are undertaken for geological disposal facilities, and skills requirements for the development of nuclear facilities. The views expressed in these reports are the professional views of the organisations and individuals that prepared them. As such, the Commission treated these reports {{in the same way as}} evidence – and the extent to which they have been accepted and relied on is identified in the findings and the reasoning in support of those findings. The release of the tentative findings on 15 February 2016 shared with the community the Commission’s preliminary thinking on issues it considered important, based on evidence. The Commission sought scrutiny by inviting public responses within five weeks. It received more than 170 direct responses. The Commission read all responses and they informed the structure and range of issues addressed in the final report, which was released by the Premier Hon Jay Weatherill on 9 May, 2016...|$|E

50|$|Morris {{was called}} to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1937. He {{was known for his}} {{particularly}} beautiful speaking voice which he used to great effect with juries. In 1950 Morris, aided by Evelyn Russell, defended Timothy Evans, a poorly educated van driver who was charged with the murder of his baby. Evans was the neighbour of serial killer John Christie, and kept insisting it was Christie who did it. Morris thought it unlikely that they would succeed in pinning it on the neighbour but Evans told him that this was what had happened and this was what he wanted to say. Morris accepted the instructions as he was obliged to do and prepared his case with professional care but not with any deep personal conviction. He also told Evans that if that was to be his defence he would have to go into the witness box and give <b>evidence</b> about it <b>on</b> <b>oath.</b> Evans told him he was perfectly willing to do so. The atmosphere in court was very favourable to Christie who was the main witness for the Crown and Evans' testimony was summarily dismissed by the prosecution and the judge Mr Justice Lewis who was seriously ill and died {{a few weeks after the}} trial. Evans was found guilty after the jury were out for just over forty minutes and hanged but it is now generally accepted by the public, experts and the Crown itself that Christie murdered Beryl and Geraldine Evans. Evans was one of the first recognised victims of a miscarriage of justice. The case was important for leading to the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1965.|$|R
