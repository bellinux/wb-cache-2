5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo when she had thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara <b>home</b> <b>late</b> on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned <b>home</b> <b>late</b> because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

His second marriage was to Valerie France (married July 1960 – died 1976) with a third son Robert, (born 1963). His third marriage was to Patricia Hoare (6 April 1977 – 1991) who survived him. Arlott's eldest son Jim {{was killed in a}} car accident on New Year's Eve 1965, driving <b>home</b> <b>late</b> at night from Southampton in a sports car which Arlott had helped him acquire.

25|$|In 1983, Loung {{entered the}} ADL Intermediate School, and {{continued}} with English language {{learning and teaching}} (ESL) sessions. Meng and Eang both found employment with IBM on the evening shift, and Loung, now thirteen years old, cared for Maria after school until they returned <b>home</b> <b>late</b> at night. Meng sent money and packages, via the Asian community in Montreal, Canada, to his family in Cambodia {{as often as he}} could throughout the 1980s; some packages either did not arrive, or arrived with some of the contents missing. In 1985, Eang gave birth to her second daughter, Victoria, and Loung entered Essex Junction High School as a freshman. A few months later, Meng and Eang were sworn in as naturalized citizens of the United States. In early 1986, the Ungs moved, with the help of their sponsors, into their own modest two-story home in a nearby neighborhood, and Loung, now nearly sixteen years old, delighted in having her own personal room.|$|E

25|$|Toole {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sense of normalcy and enrolled in Tulane {{in the fall of}} 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser's close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole's longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his <b>home</b> <b>late</b> in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him behind his back, and that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a talk with him, which he felt, for the time being, calmed him down.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his death he was a Cuban marxist revolutionary in Mexico trying to {{organize}} the overthrow of the Cuban government of General Gerardo Machado. This cause was an embarrassment to the Cuban Communist Party, which was trying to gain power by establishing a modus vivendi with Machado. What further disturbed the Cuban communists was that they felt he had fallen under Leon Trotsky's influence. Mella was assassinated on January 10, 1929, while walking <b>home</b> <b>late</b> at night with photographer Tina Modotti. The Mexican government tried to implicate Modotti in the murder, even releasing nude photographs of her by Edward Weston in an attempt to generate public opinion against her. Muralist Diego Rivera played a very active role in defending her and exposing the Mexican government's crude attempt to frame her. It is unclear whether Mella was murdered by the dictatorial Cuban government; if his death had been brought about by Trotsky-Stalin Communist Party feuding; or by a combination of these mutual interests. It is widely speculated that he died by the notoriously bloody hand of Vittorio Vidali.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{struggled}} {{at times}} on offense, posting the third-worst batting {{average in the}} National League ahead of only the Braves and Milwaukee Brewers amid poor performances at the plate from center fielder Michael A. Taylor, left fielder Jayson Werth, and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, despite strong hitting from Harper and second baseman Daniel Murphy, an off-season acquisition who hit in 12 straight games during the month and had 11 multi-hit games. The team also suffered injuries to regular players, with Ben Revere, acquired in the off-season to play center field, straining his oblique during his first at-bat of the season on April 4 and ending up {{on the disabled list}}, and reliever Matt Belisle, another off-season pickup, being placed on the disabled list after straining his calf while pitching on April 26. Outfielder Matt den Dekker and reliever Sammy Solis were called up from the Syracuse Chiefs, the Nationals' Class AAA International League affiliate, to replace them on the roster. Amid an offensive lull and the injury to Belisle, Washington was swept at <b>home</b> <b>late</b> in the month by the division rival Phillies for their first series loss of the year.|$|E

It was also mentioned in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (as well as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film), The Creeping Terror and Meteor. Jodrell Bank also featured heavily in the music video to Electric Light Orchestras 1983 single Secret Messages.

500|$|Because {{of the two}} rebel cavalry {{units in}} the area (the second group at Sinking Creek plus another unit near Lewisberg), the {{regiment}} began their return <b>home</b> <b>late</b> that afternoon. The rebel pursuit was ineffective, although there was some skirmishing with the 2nd Loyal Virginia's rear guard. Ten more of the regiment's horses died from exhaustion on the trip home. The nighttime portion of this return trip was conducted non-stop. Other than horses and weather-related injuries (two men were hospitalized with frozen feet), the regiment suffered no casualties during a 70-hour excursion. The leaders of the advance guard, William H. Powell and Jeremiah Davidson, were promoted shortly afterwards—Powell from major to lieutenant colonel, and Davidson from second lieutenant to first lieutenant. Years after the war, Powell was awarded the Medal of Honor for his performance in the Sinking Creek raid.
