40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodology {{for the development}} of city wide pedestrian demand models and shows its application to London. The approach used for modelling is Multiple Regression Analysis of independent variables against the dependent variable of observed pedestrian flows. The test samples were from manual observation studies of average total pedestrian <b>flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> on 237 sample sites. The model will provide predicted flow values for all 7, 526 street segments in the 25 square kilometres of Central London. It has been independently validated by Transport for London and is being tested against further observation data. The longer term aim is to extend the model to the entire greater London area and to incorporate additional policy levers for use as a transport planning and evaluation tool...|$|E

40|$|In this {{literature}} review automatic milking is reviewed on two main topics, the role within product quality and control {{systems and the}} possibilities of applying reverse osmosis on the farm. The milking process is a key process within a total quality management system on dairy farms. The milk production process was analysed using a Pareto analysis, identifying the main factors Man, Materials, Methods and Machinery. For each of these main factors quality control has been described for both automatic milking and conventional milking. On-farm condensing of milk {{will contribute to the}} reduction of transport costs between the dairy farmer and the dairy processor. In The Netherlands on-farm condensing of milk is not practised due to lack of profitability (long payback times). However with the introduction of automatic milking on dairy farms, new chances appear. The high level of automation within AM-systems, the relatively low milk <b>flow</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> availability of high-tech cleaning systems within AM-systems and the overall scaling up of dairy farms can be mentioned as chances in reducing payback times of condensing equipment...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSupplying {{water in}} desert areas or {{isolated}} sites {{is the perfect}} job for along sun pumping systems. However, due to their relatively high cost, the sizing of these systems implies {{the use of an}} accurate tool. This paper presents a method {{that could be used for}} the sizing of an along the sun pumping system based on energetic considerations, simple modeling and fitting methods. The model described allows to predict the <b>flow</b> rate <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> for a given daily solar irradiance profile. It uses a three-phase induction machine, a voltage inverter and a centrifugal pump. Some experimental results are also confronted with the calculated ones in order to show the accuracy of the model. The accuracy of the model is shown to be good and essentially depends on the precision used to model each element in the overall system...|$|R
5000|$|Production {{from the}} field peaked in 1929, with a total {{production}} of [...] of oil. That year also saw the spudding of well Yates 30-A, which blew out with the spectacular <b>flow</b> of [...] <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> and over 200,000 in a day, setting the world record; even the Lakeview Gusher at the Midway-Sunset field in California, which spewed a total of approximately [...] in its 18-month uncontrolled run, only attained half of that daily flow rate. Because of the high production rate {{from the field}} and lack of storage and transport, the State of Texas Railroad Commission - the entity that oversees petroleum production - required a proration of the field {{for the first time in}} Texas history. Under this rule, all operators were given an equal share in the pipeline outlet based on what their wells could produce, based on the total field production. Additionally, operators were restricted in the depth they could drill into the cavernous reservoir, to give each an equal advantage.|$|R
40|$|Diffuse {{pollution}} {{is the least}} known type among all kinds of pollution and its origin care come from natural or human sources. Because it is formed by particles, they have {{a higher rate of}} scattering through water ways, making this type of pollution more difficult to quantity and characterize as a polluting source. Through superficial runoff caused by rains these residues reach rivers, causing significant impacts in the water quality of rivers. The Belem river runs through important areas such as parks and highly populated areas. Traffic in the urban areas is very intense, causing a high use of the vehicles breaking system, and therefore degrading the breaks’ disk. The objective was to research the effect the polluting from the vehicles’ breaks has upon the Bay Division- 1 form the Belem River, caused by the particles’ runoff done by the rain. There were made bibliographic research, visits to car-repair-shops, researching from Curitiba’s Urbaning date, identifying eight evolution points, four in the bay’s waters and 4 in the streets evaluating the vehicles’ flow. It was analyzed the degration/usage of two break’s plagues of a car’s wheel from one car, for sixty days, estimating the possible usage according with the vehicles’ traffic flow. The traffic <b>flows</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> in the four identified evolution points were: Point 1 : 1290, Point 2 : 565, Point 3 : 144, Point 4 : 745. The degration of the two break’s plagues that were analyzed in one day was 0, 0035 g, therefore, in a year it world be 1, 265 g. In comparison the break’s degration with the traffic flow in points 1, 2, 3 and 4, the area that {{has the potential to be}} the greatest polluting potential due to the higher traffic flow is point 1. In one hour the estimated break’s plagues degration was 0, 140 g. It is inevitable that the break’s degration occurs, if not, there world be no need to repair or replace the break’s plagues in a vehicle revision. In the analyses of the evaluating points it was not possible to identify the pollution particles concentration. It is suggested that since these materials are not soluble in water. With the constant river flow, the particles tend to settle at the bottom of the rivers. Therefore, the methods used for quantifying in the water should not be the only ones to evaluate the potential polluting source, making the need for future research necessary with the use of more specific analysis for the settling materials...|$|R

50|$|The goal of Lighthill and Whitham, on {{the other}} hand, was to propose a new method of study “suggested by {{theories}} of the flow about supersonic projectiles and of flood movement in rivers.” The resulting model would capture both of the aforementioned relationships, speed-flow and speed-headway, into a single curve, which would “sum up all the properties of a stretch of road which are relevant to its ability to handle the flow of congested traffic.” The model they presented related traffic flow to concentration (now typically known as density). They wrote, “The fundamental hypothesis of {{the theory is that}} at any point of the road the <b>flow</b> q (vehicles <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> {{is a function of the}} concentration k (vehicles per mile).” According to this model, traffic flow resembled the flow of water in that “Slight changes in flow are propagated back through the stream of vehicles along ‘kinematic waves,’ whose velocity relative to the road is the slope of the graph of flow against concentration.” The authors included an example of such a graph; this flow-versus-concentration (density) plot is still used today (see figure 3 above).|$|R
5000|$|Water {{movement}} {{is important in}} the reef aquarium with different types of coral requiring different flow rates. At present, many hobbyists advocate a water turnover rate of 10x: 10 x aquarium capacity in gallons = required <b>flow</b> in gallons <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> This is a general rule with many exceptions. Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little flow to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble coral, elegance coral, cup coral, torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of flow, and small polyp stony corals such as Acropora, Montipora, Porites, and Pocillopora require high, turbulent, conditions, which imitates breaking waves in shallow water near the tip of the reef. The directions which water pumps are pointed within an aquarium will have a large effect on flow speeds. Many corals will gradually move themselves to a different area of the tank if the water movement in its current area is not satisfactory. [...] "Since flow speed is the critical measure for determining the rate of gas exchange, turnover does little to convey how fast a coral will respire and photosynthesize." ...|$|R
