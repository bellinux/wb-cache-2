She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{the first}} faint gray of the dawn the stately wild turkeys would be {{stalking}} around in great flocks, {{and ready to}} be sociable and answer invitations to come and converse with other excursionists of their kind. The hunter concealed himself and imitated the turkey-call by sucking the air through the leg-bone of a turkey which had previously answered a call like that and lived only {{just long enough to}} regret it. There is nothing that furnishes a perfect turkey-call except that bone. Another of Nature's treacheries, you see. She is full of them; half the time she doesn't know which she likes best--to betray her child or protect it. In the case of the turkey she is badly mixed: she gives it a bone to be used in getting it into trouble, and she also furnishes it with a trick for getting itself out of the trouble again. When a mamma-turkey answers an invitation and finds she has made a mistake in accepting it, she does as the mamma-partridge does--remembers a previous engagement--and goes limping and scrambling away, pretending to be very lame; {{and at the same time}} she <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> her not-visible children, [...] "Lie low, keep still, don't expose yourselves; I shall be back as soon as I have beguiled this shabby swindler out of the country." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{this is one}} of the two {{or three}} vital defences of working democracy. The mere {{machinery}} of voting is not democracy, though at present it is not easy to effect any simpler democratic method. But even the machinery of voting is profoundly Christian in this practical sense--that it is an attempt to get at the opinion of those who would be too modest to offer it. It is a mystical adventure; it is specially trusting those who do not trust themselves. That enigma is strictly peculiar to Christendom. There is nothing really humble about the abnegation of the Buddhist; the mild Hindoo is mild, but he is not meek. But there is something psychologically Christian about the idea of seeking for the opinion of the obscure rather than taking the obvious course of accepting the opinion of the prominent. To say that voting is particularly Christian may seem somewhat curious. To say that canvassing is Christian may seem quite crazy. But canvassing is very Christian in its primary idea. It is encouraging the humble; it <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> the modest man, [...] "Friend, go up higher." [...] Or if there is some slight defect in canvassing, that is in its perfect and rounded piety, it is only because it may possibly neglect to encourage the modesty of the canvasser.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is about}} the size of it. But it is no harm. We all do it at first. It's {{perfectly}} natural. You see, on earth we jump to such foolish conclusions as to things up here. In the pictures we always saw the angels with wings on--and that was all right; but we jumped to the conclusion that that was their way of getting around- -and that was all wrong. The wings ain't anything but a uniform, that's all. When they are in the field--so to speak,--they always wear them; you never see an angel going with a message anywhere without his wings, any more than you would see a military officer presiding at a court-martial without his uniform, or a postman delivering letters, or a policeman walking his beat, in plain clothes. But they ain't to FLY with! The wings are for show, not for use. Old experienced angels are like officers of the regular army--they dress plain, when they are off duty. New angels are like the militia--never shed the uniform--always fluttering and floundering around in their wings, butting people down, flapping here, and there, and everywhere, always imagining they are attracting the admiring eye--well, they just think they are the very most important people in heaven. And when you see one of them come sailing around with one wing tipped up and t'other down, you make up your mind he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself: 'I wish Mary Ann in Arkansaw could see me now. I reckon she'd wish she hadn't shook me.' No, they're just for show, that's all--only just for show." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yamsi," [...] I should explain, {{is a mere}} code address, and I use it here symbolically. I {{have seen}} {{commerce}} pretty close. I {{know what it is}} worth, and I have no particular regard for commercial magnates, but one must protest against these Bumble-like proceedings. Is it indignation at the loss of so many lives which is at work here? Well, the American railroads kill very many people during one single year, I dare say. Then why don't these dignitaries come down on the presidents of their own railroads, of which one can't say whether they are mere means of transportation or a sort of gambling game for the use of American plutocrats. Is it only an ardent and, upon the whole, praiseworthy desire for information? But the reports of the inquiry tell us that the august senators, though raising a lot of questions testifying to the complete innocence and even blankness of their minds, are unable to understand what the second officer <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> them. We are so informed by the press from the other side. Even such a simple expression as that one of the look-out men was stationed in the [...] "eyes of the ship" [...] was too much for the senators of the land of graphic expression. What it must have been in the more recondite matters I won't even try to think, because I have no mind for smiles just now. They were greatly exercised about the sound of explosions heard when half the ship was under water already. Was there one? Were there two? They seemed to be smelling a rat there! Has not some charitable soul told them (what even schoolboys who read sea stories know) that when a ship sinks from a leak like this, a deck or two is always blown up; and that when a steamship goes down by the head, the boilers may, and often do break adrift with a sound which resembles the sound of an explosion? And they may, indeed, explode, for all I know. In the only case I have seen of a steamship sinking there was such a sound, but I didn't dive down after her to investigate. She was not of 45,000 tons and declared unsinkable, but the sight was impressive enough. I shall never forget the muffled, mysterious detonation, the sudden agitation of the sea round the slowly raised stern, and to this day I have in my eye the propeller, seen perfectly still in its frame against a clear evening sky.|$|E

6000|$|The change made Dickens {{a greater}} novelist. I {{am not sure}} that it made him a greater man. One good {{character}} by Dickens requires all eternity to stretch its legs in; and the characters in his later books are always being tripped up by some tiresome nonsense about the story. For instance, in Dombey and Son, Mrs. Skewton is really very funny. But nobody with a love of the real smell of Dickens would compare her for a moment, for instance, with Mrs. Nickleby. And the reason of Mrs. Skewton's inferiority is simply this, that she has something to do in the plot; she has to entrap or assist to entrap Mr. Dombey into marrying Edith. Mrs. Nickleby, on the other hand, has nothing at all to do in the story, except to get in everybody's way. The consequence is that we complain not of her for getting in everyone's way, but of everyone for getting in hers. What are suns and stars, what are times and seasons, what is the mere universe, that it should presume to interrupt Mrs. Nickleby? Mrs. Skewton (though supposed, of course, to be a much viler sort of woman) has something of the same quality of splendid and startling irrelevancy. In her also there is the same feeling of wild threads hung from world to world like the webs of gigantic spiders; of things connected that seem to have no connection save by this one adventurous filament of frail and daring folly. Nothing could be better than Mrs. Skewton when she finds herself, after convolutions of speech, somehow on the subject of Henry VIII., and pauses to mention with approval [...] "his dear little peepy eyes and his benevolent chin." [...] Nothing could be better than her attempt at Mahomedan resignation when she feels almost inclined to say [...] "that there is no What's-his-name but Thingummy, and What-you-may-call-it is his prophet!" [...] But she has not so much time as Mrs. Nickleby to say these good things; also she has not sufficient human virtue to say them constantly. She is always intent upon her worldly plans, among other things upon the worldly plan of assisting Charles Dickens to get a story finished. She is always [...] "advancing her shrivelled ear" [...] to listen to what Dombey <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> Edith. Worldliness is the most solemn thing in the world; it is far more solemn than other-worldliness. Mrs. Nickleby can afford to ramble as a child does in a field, or as a child does to laugh at nothing, for she is like a child, innocent. It is only the good who can afford to be frivolous.|$|E
6000|$|After dinner (as I {{need not}} tell the keen {{observer}} of human nature who peruses this) the human mind, if the body be in a decent state, expands into gayety and benevolence, and the intellect longs to measure itself in friendly converse with the divers intelligences around it. We ascend upon deck, and after eying {{each other for a}} brief space and with a friendly modest hesitation, we begin anon to converse about the weather and other profound and delightful themes of English discourse. We confide to each other our respective opinions of the ladies round about us. Look at that charming creature in a pink bonnet and a dress of the pattern of a Kilmarnock snuff-box: a stalwart Irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very agreeable into her ear, as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation; for her dark eyes kindle, her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves, and glance brightly in the sun; while round the teeth and the lips a number of lovely dimples make their appearance, and her whole countenance assumes a look of perfect health and happiness. See her companion in shot silk and a dove-colored parasol; in what a graceful Watteau-like attitude she reclines. The tall courier who has been bouncing about the deck in attendance upon these ladies (it is his first day of service, and he is eager to make a favorable impression on them and the lady's-maids too) has just brought them from the carriage a small paper of sweet cakes (nothing is prettier than to see a pretty woman eating sweet biscuits) and a bottle that evidently contains Malmsey madeira. How daintily they sip it; how happy they seem; how that lucky rogue of an Irishman prattles away! Yonder is a noble group indeed: an English gentleman and his family. Children, mother, grandmother, grown-up daughters, father, and domestics, twenty-two in all. They have a table to themselves on the deck, and the consumption of eatables among them is really endless. The nurses have been bustling to and fro, and bringing, first, slices of cake; then dinner; then tea with huge family jugs of milk; and the little people have been playing hide-and-seek round the deck, coquetting with the other children, and making friends of every soul on board. I love to see the kind eyes of women fondly watching them as they gambol about; a female face, be it ever so plain, when occupied in regarding children, becomes celestial almost, and a man can hardly fail to be good and happy while he is looking on at such sights. [...] "Ah, sir!" [...] says a great big man, whom you would not accuse of sentiment, [...] "I have a couple of those little things at home;" [...] and he stops and heaves a great big sigh and swallows down a half-tumbler of cold something and water. We know what the honest fellow means well enough. He <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> himself, [...] "God bless my girls and their mother!" [...] but, being a Briton, is too manly to speak out in a more intelligible way. Perhaps it is as well for him to be quiet, and not chatter and gesticulate like those Frenchmen a few yards from him, who are chirping over a bottle of champagne.|$|E
6000|$|But of {{all modern}} writers Mr. Froude {{has been the}} hardest to Cicero. His sketch {{of the life of}} Cæsar is one {{prolonged}} censure on that of Cicero. Our historian, with all that glory of language for which he is so remarkable, has covered the poor orator with obloquy. There is no period in Cicero's life so touching, I think, as that during which he was hesitating whether, {{in the service of the}} Republic, it did or did not behoove him to join Pompey before the battle of Pharsalia. At this time he wrote to his friend Atticus various letters full of agonizing doubts as to what was demanded from him by his duty to his country, by his friendship for Pompey, by loyalty to his party, and by his own dignity. As to a passage in one of those, Mr. Froude says [...] "that Cicero had lately spoken of Cæsar's continuance in life as a disgrace to the State." [...] "It has been seen also that he had long thought of assassination as the readiest means of ending it,"[1] says Mr. Froude. The [...] "It has been seen" [...] refers to a statement made a few pages earlier, in which he translates certain words written by Cicero to Atticus.[2] [...] "He considered it a disgrace to them that Cæsar was alive." [...] That is his translation; and in his indignation he puts other words, as it were, into the mouth of his literary brother of two thousand years before. [...] "Why did not somebody kill him?" [...] The Latin words themselves are added in a note, [...] "Cum vivere ipsum turpe sit nobis."[3] Hot indignation has so carried the translator away that he has missed the very sense of Cicero's language. [...] "When even to draw the breath of life at such a time is a disgrace to us!" [...] That is what Cicero meant. Mr. Froude in a preceding passage gives us another passage from a letter to Atticus,[4] [...] "Cæsar was mortal."[5] So much is an intended translation. Then Mr. Froude tells us how Cicero had [...] "hailed Cæsar's eventual murder with rapture;" [...] and goes on to say, [...] "We read the words with sorrow and yet with pity." [...] But Cicero had never dreamed of Cæsar's murder. The words of the passage are as follows: [...] "Hunc primum mortalem esse, deinde etiam multis modis extingui posse cogitabam." [...] "I bethought myself in the first place that this man was mortal, and then that there were a hundred ways in which he might be put on one side." [...] All the latter authorities have, I believe, supposed the [...] "hunc" [...] or [...] "this man" [...] to be Pompey. I should say that this was proved by the gist of the whole letter--one of the most interesting that was ever written, as telling the workings of a great man's mind at a peculiar crisis of his life--did I not know that former learned editors have supposed Cæsar to have been meant. But whether Cæsar or Pompey, there is nothing in it to do with murder. It is a question--Cicero <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> his friend--of the stability of the Republic. When a matter so great is considered, how is a man to trouble himself as to an individual who may die any day, or cease from any accident to be of weight? Cicero was speaking of the effect of this or that step on his own part. Am I, he says, for the sake of Pompey to bring down hordes of barbarians on my own country, sacrificing the Republic for the sake of a friend who is here to-day and may be gone to-morrow? Or for the sake of an enemy, if the reader thinks that the [...] "hunc" [...] refers to Cæsar. The argument is the same. Am I to consider an individual when the Republic is at stake? Mr. Froude tells us that he reads [...] "the words with sorrow and yet with pity." [...] So would every one, I think, sympathizing with the patriot's doubts as to his leader, as to his party, and as to his country. Mr. Froude does so because he gathers from them that Cicero is premeditating the murder of Cæsar! ...|$|E
