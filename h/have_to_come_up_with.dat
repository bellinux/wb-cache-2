5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> £100 {{million a year to}} better their offer. Parry was undecided as to which bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E

500|$|Ian Wolf {{from the}} British Comedy Guide commented that: [...] "The {{fact that the}} series moved {{from town to town}} was very {{impressive}} – as it meant Steel had to write a unique half-hour routine for each venue (compare this to most stand-ups, who only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> about an hour of strong material a year!)." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Market Forces" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Robinson and {{directed}} by Dan Fausett. Though the show {{is done in the}} style of traditional animation, computer-generated imagery was used to produce the green sonic beams made by Shocker. In the original comic book publications, Shocker's secret identity was a man named Herman Schultz. For The Spectacular Spider-Man, they changed his identity to that of Enforcer Montana, who had, in the comics, been a prominent character already. Using Montana allowed the writers to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a completely new origin for Shocker. His suit was generally the same as that done in the comic books, but had extra features including goggles and vibrators. His voice was provided by veteran voice performer Jeff Bennett.|$|E
500|$|He {{also argued}} that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] and trilogy episodes in general are an excuse for the series' writers to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> new stories for the characters. [...] "It's {{understandable}} that after eleven years, a show might have trouble continuing {{to come up with}} original material for the same five characters, but the anthology episodes come across as rather transparent attempts to avoid that challenge", he wrote. On the other hand, DVD Verdict's Mac MacEntire argued that [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] is one of the season's best episodes. He wrote that the episode is [...] "filled with great gags", including the hobo's sponge bath and Bart and Nelson's discussion about [...] "backtacks" [...] and [...] "tackbacks".|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding Wolverine {{within the}} context of the X-Men film series, Tom Charity of CNN commented: [...] "Serviceable but inescapably redundant, this Wolverine movie does just enough to keep the X-Men {{franchise}} on life support, but the filmmakers will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> some evolutionary changes soon if it's going to escape X-tinction." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times expressed that [...] "X-Men Origins: Wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue." [...] On a more negative note, Philip French of The Observer said that the film's [...] "dull, bone-crushing, special-effects stuff" [...] is [...] "of interest only to hardcore fans who've probably read it all in Marvel comics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kingdom Hearts III will {{introduce}} more worlds such as Kingdom of Corona, San Fransokyo, and {{one based on}} Toy Story. When questioned {{on the possibility of}} including worlds based on Disney-purchased properties such as Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm, co-director Tai Yasue said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a world {{that has a lot of}} originality. We want variety... so we don't want too many of one sort of world, that would look the same. For each world there has to be some meaning for it, in the plot... Also, gameplay-wise, is that world something that would make gameplay fun?" [...] The game will not feature any worlds based on Final Fantasy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{classical}} statistical mechanics, {{the number}} of microstates is actually uncountably infinite, since the properties of classical systems are continuous. For example, a microstate of a classical ideal gas is specified by the positions and momenta of all the atoms, which range continuously over the real numbers. If we want to define Ω, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a method of grouping the microstates together to obtain a countable set. This procedure is known as coarse graining. In {{the case of the}} ideal gas, we count two states of an atom as the [...] "same" [...] state if their positions and momenta are within δx and δp of each other. Since the values of δx and δp can be chosen arbitrarily, the entropy is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an additive constant. (As we will see, the thermodynamic definition of entropy is also defined only up to a constant.) ...|$|E

50|$|Because this {{exercise}} is {{an introduction to}} argument in the philosophical schools, the use of thesis was not performed until first completing all previous exercises.

5000|$|This project {{initially}} {{came about}} {{as part of}} [...] "February Album Writing Month," [...] a website that challenges songwriters to write 14 songs in 28 days. The three songwriters wrote and recorded rough demos of the first 42 songs in February 2006 (leaving only George W. Bush for later). [...] "It was an amazing challenge to get that many songs written, even split three ways," [...] notes Kiefer.
