The welding technicality of the electrodes was analyzed, and the wear resistance of the deposited metal was studied through a slurry abrasive wear test.

The microstructure of the <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> consisted of lath martensite and fine strengthening phase with dispersive distribution. The mass loss of <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> was about one third of that of substrate, which means the <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> has a good wear resistance property.

As the high-carbon Cr-basedhardfacing alloy was hypereutectic composition, the microstructure consisted of massiveamounts of (Cr,Fe) 23 C 6 and (Cr,Fe) 7 C 3 carbides at room temperature.

40|$|Hardfacing alloys are weld {{deposited}} on a base material {{to provide a}} wear resistant surface. Commercially available iron-base hardfacing alloys are being evaluated for replacement of cobalt-base alloys to reduce nuclear plant activation levels. Corrosion testing {{was used to evaluate}} the corrosion resistance of several iron-base hardfacing alloys in highly oxygenated environments. The corrosion test results indicate that iron-base hardfacing alloys in the as-deposited condition have acceptable corrosion resistance when the chromium to carbon ratio is greater than 4. Tristelle 5183, with a high niobium (stabilizer) content, did not follow this trend due to precipitation of niobium-rich carbides instead of chromium-rich carbides. This result indicates that iron-base hardfacing alloys containing high stabilizer contents may possess good corrosion resistance with Cr:C < 4. NOREM 02, NOREM 01, and NoCo-M 2 hardfacing alloys had acceptable corrosion resistance in the as-deposited and 885 C/ 4 hour heat treated condition, but rusting from sensitization was observed in the 621 C/ 6 hour heat treated condition. The feasibility of using an Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (EPR) test method, such as used for stainless steel, to detect sensitization in iron-base hardfacing alloys was evaluated. A single loop-EPR method was found to provide a more consistent measurement of sensitization than a double loop-EPR method. The high carbon content that is needed for a wear resistant <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> produces a high volume fraction of chromium-rich carbides that are attacked during EPR testing.

40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of the processing conditions on the microstructure and abrasive wear behaviour of a NiCrBSi <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> is analysed. The <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> was applied in the form of coatings onto a mild steel substrate (Fe- 0. 15 %C) by different techniques: laser cladding (LC) and flame spraying (FS) combined with surface flame melting (SFM). In both cases, the appropriate selection of the process parameters enabled high-quality, defect-free NiCrBSi coatings to be obtained. The microstructure of the coatings was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with attached energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) microprobe, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Their tribological properties were evaluated by micro-scale ball cratering abrasive wear tests using different abrasives: diamond, SiC and WC. Microstructural characterisation showed that both coatings exhibit similar phases in their microstructure, but the phases present differ in morphology, size distribution and relative proportions from one coating to another. Wear tests showed that in three-body abrasive conditions, despite these microstructural differences, the wear behaviour is comparable for both coatings. Conversely, in two-body wear conditions with diamond particles as the abrasive, it was observed that the specific wear rate of the material is sensitive to microstructural changes. This fact is particularly apparent in LC coatings, in which the zones of the layers with higher proportions of very small hard particles present a lower wear resistance. These results indicate {{that it is important to}} have good microstructural control of this material, in order to obtain coatings with an optimized and homogeneous tribological behaviour. © 2005 Elsevier B.

Depending on the four different graphite additions in these alloy fillers, this research produces hypoeutectic, near eutectic, and hypereutectic microstructures of Fe-Cr phase, (Cr,Fe) (23) C(6), and (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides on <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys,</b> respectively. Findings show Si to partition strongly into the Fe-Cr phase during solidification with very low solubility in (Cr,Fe) (23) C(6) and (Cr,Fe) (7) C(3) carbides. The cross-section analysis indicates epitaxial solidification with planar front growth at the interface between hardfacing and the substrate. Furthermore, eutectic growth exists in the near interface as hardfacing composition falls in the hypereutectic region. The microstructures in middle zone are {{similar to that of the}} near surface, causing uniform hardness profile. Finally, hardness of the hypereutectic alloy with 4. 05 wt% C is about three times higher than that with 1. 35 wt% C.

40|$|High Chromium White Irons (HCWI) <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the mining and other processing industries. <b>Hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> are mainly meant for combating the wear of components and structures. However, these alloys are also used under conditions that involve corrosive fluids and only limited studies {{are available on the}} corrosion behaviour of these <b>alloys.</b> The <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> are mainly based on carbides. The most popular abrasion resistance alloy is based on chromium carbides. In the first stage of the thesis, Pourbaix diagrams developed for chromium carbides and other strong carbide forming elements such as titanium, niobium and tungsten at 298 K using thermodynamic data of the stable species, equilibrium reduction reactions and thermodynamic calculations. The Pourbaix diagrams were useful in predicting and explaining the corrosion behavior of the <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys.</b> In addition, experiments were designed in the regions of interest such as a combination of pH and potential. In the second stage of this research, experimental work was carried out to investigate the corrosion behaviour of welded HCWI <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> with strong carbide forming elements in acidic, alkaline and neutral environments. The HCWI selected are as described in the Australian Standards AS 2576, which is probably the most advanced standard in the world as it defines not only the hardness but also its microstructures. The HCWI microstructure consists of primary and eutectic carbides and eutectic austenitic/martensitic matrix. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic tests were used to study the corrosion behaviour of HCWI in all the three environments. In alkaline pH 14 and neutral pH 7 buffer solutions, corrosion of HCWI occurs at carbides in preference to eutectic austenite matrix. In acidic pH 1. 5 and neutral pH 7 NaCl solutions, corrosion of HCWI occurs at eutectic martensitic matrix in preference to carbides. Whereas, in acidic solution of pH 2, the corrosion occurs at eutectic carbides in preference to eutectic austenite matrix. From these experimental results, the corrosion trend of HCWI in acidic, alkaline and neutral environments was studied using the superimposed Pourbaix diagram of carbides. From the study of superimposed Pourbaix diagrams of carbides found that in all the three environments, corrosion of eutectic austenite/martensitic matrix or carbides depended upon the formation of passive film on the surface of eutectic austenite/martensite. The corrosion of eutectic martensitic matrix in neutral pH 7 NaCl solution is mainly due to removal of passive layer by the aggressive chloride ions in the solution. The Pourbaix diagram of chromium carbides revealed that stability of Cr 23 C 6 eutectic carbides were found to be less stable than the Cr 7 C 3 primary carbides. The superimposed Pourbaix diagrams of carbides and hardness tests also showed that dissociation of carbides reduces the wear resistance of HCWI <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> significantly.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{corrosion}} behaviour of <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> was investigated. Widely used <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> in {{the industry}} are based on chromium carbides. These <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> are not only used in conditions where good wear resistance is required but also in corrosive environments. In these alloys, chromium provides good corrosion resistance and the carbides provide good hardness. Chromium carbides remove chromium in solution thus rendering them susceptible to corrosion. Because of this combination {{it is unclear whether}} these alloys are able to form a passive film. This will be tested in the thesis. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a method of applying an AC signal with an amplitude of 10 mV at various frequencies and analysing the impedance response of a sample using Bode and Nyquist plots. EIS was used to analyse the corrosion behaviour of <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys.</b> Testing was conducted at rest potential and passive potential in a solution of 2 M NaOH with a pH of 14 to simulate alumina industry conditions. Results were gathered for the electrochemical properties of each sample before and after 24 hours of soak. The data is interpreted by developing Bode and Nyquist plots. A high value of resistance and a low value of capacitance indicate high corrosion resistance or a passive film. Testing conducted in this thesis indicates that {{it is very difficult to}} identify passive behaviour with the samples using EIS. However, the results did show which sample had the best corrosion resistance. The sample which contained the highest amount of chromium and carbon in the matrix had the highest corrosion resistance. This sample had the smallest change in resistance compared to the other samples over 24 hours when testing was conducted at rest potential and passive potential. However, it is not conclusive whether chromium content affects the corrosion resistance of a sample without further testing being conducted.

Issues are mainly addressed toward the development of new <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> compositions, on laser cladding of internal surfaces of the barrels by mini laser heads and on the deposition of WC reinforced Ni-Cr alloys by laser...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{investigated}} fumes generated by selected welding electrodes used in mines {{in order to}} help determine their relative health hazard potential. Fumes were generated and collected in an enclosed chamber for subsequent generation rate and chemical constituent determination. Shielded metal arc electrodes from the following groups were tested: AWS types E 308 - 16 and E 310 - 16 stainless steel, ECoCr-A Co-Cr <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy,</b> ENiCr Ni, an Mn-Cr buildup alloy, E 7018 carbon steel, and EII 018 -M low-alloy steel. Flux-cored wire electrodes of this last group also were tested. Fume generation rates and the chemical composition of the fumes were measured. From these data, exposure in-dices were determined, which give a relative measure of the health hazard potential of using the electrodes. The effect of welding onto build-up alloy layers on the fume composition also was examined for five of the higher alloy groups...|$|E
40|$|Fe- 17 Cr- 4 C- 2 V-Mn-Si-Ti {{complex system}} <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> were {{deposited}} by using flux-cored wire self-shielded open arc welding. The effects of silicon on their M 7 C 3 (M =Fe, Cr, V, Mn) phases and abrasion resistance were investigated by OM, XRD and SEM. The results show that, with silicon content increasing from 0. 6 %(mass fraction) to 2. 4 %, {{the size of}} primary M 7 C 3 carbides gradually reduces and transites from rod-like shape to block-like shape in dispersion distributing state. γ-Fe phases, which adjacent to those primary M 7 C 3 grains, progressively reduce until disappear. It dues to that silicon can change the precursor of primary M 7 C 3 nucleates in nature, e. g. liquid high carbon atom clusters and it results in the change of their morphology, distribution and size. The wear test {{results indicate that the}} abrasion resistance of open arc <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> improves firstly and then reduces when silicon content increases from 0. 6 % to 2. 4 %. The optimum abrasion resistance is acquired at 1. 5 %Si. The analysis on the surface worn morphologies show that the micro-cutting and micro-spalling wearing mechanisms coexist...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Bureau of Mines {{program to}} reduce U. S. {{reliance}} on foreign suppliers of strategic and critical metals, research was conducted to improve technology for the recovery of critical metals from <b>hardface</b> <b>alloy</b> grinding waste, a form of superalloy scrap. This report describes a hydrometallurgical process that demonstrated on a laboratory scale that 79 pct of the chromium, 97 pct of the cobalt, 99 pct of the manganese, 99 pct of the nickel, and 90 pct of the tungsten could be recovered in chemical form from <b>hardface</b> <b>alloy</b> grinding waste. The process involved deoiling the grinding waste, followed by chloride-based dissolution of the deoiled material. A high-grade calcium tungstate (CaW 04) product was recovered from the resultant leach residue by caustic leaching and precipitation. Iron, cobalt, man-ganese, and nickel chlorides were sequentially recovered from the leach liquor by solvent extraction. Amine extractants were used to extract the iron, cobalt, and manganese; decanal oxime was used to extract the nickel. Market-grade cobalt chloride (CoCI 2), manganese chloride (MnC 12), and nickel chloride (NiCl 2) products could be produced directly from the resultant strip liquors. The final raffrnate was a relatively pure chromic chloride (CrCI 3) solution that compared favorably with commercial solutions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{investigation}} of the effect of ferroboron and ferrochromium with massive wire based <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys.</b> Mixture of Fe–Cr and Fe–B powders was added to massive wire during welding process. Hardface layers were obtained by three different powder mixture and three different powder/massive wire proportions. Hardfacing was applied to two AISI 1020 steel substrates by open arc welding. Hardness test, scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction analysis were made to the samples. Test results showed that increasing ferroboron content and increasing powder mixture amount enhanced the microhardness of the specimens...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{microstructure}} and wear characteristics of hypoeutectic, eutectic and hypereutectic (Cr,Fe) (23) C- 6 carbides in <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> cladding by using {{gas tungsten arc welding}} (GTAW). Chromium and graphite alloy fillers {{were used to}} clad ASTM A 36 steel substrates. These coatings were specially designed to vary the size and proportion of the (Cr,Fe) (23) C- 6 carbides that are present in the microstructure at room temperature. Depending on the amount of graphite used in the alloy filler, a hypoeutectic, eutectic or hypereutectic microstructure was obtained on the coated surface. The wear behavior indicated that the abrasive wear resistance is not only simply related to the hardness of the deposit but that it is also determined by the carbides and matrix structure of the coating. The hypereutectic carbides have the largest (Cr,Fe) (23) C- 6 carbide content and the maximum hardness; however, they show the worst wear resistance due to the large particles were dug out during wearing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{is focused}} on the {{influence}} of process parameters during gas atomization on the thermal spraying properties of a Ni-Cr-B-Si <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy.</b> The metal powder alloy, known as 1 - 60 - 20, is produced by Höganäs AB. There have been problems with insufficient fusing during flame spraying of this particular alloy sometimes, even though the chemical composition is always within spec. This has lead to a theory that the difference in performance is caused by differences in parameters during gas atomization. Several gas-gas and gas-water atomizations with varying parameters were performed at the Höganäs Pilot Centre. The powder samples were then analyzed by sieving, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and finally tested by powder welding. The results show that by increasing the cooling rate during gas atomization the formation of unstable Ni-borides is possible for this alloy. If these Ni-borides will enhance the fusing properties of the alloy is unknown. According to the literature studied, it should however improve the fusing properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of micrometric alumina (low surface area-to-volume ratio) and nanometric alumina (high surface area-to-volume ratio) on microstructure, hardness and abrasive wear of a NiCrBSi <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloy</b> coating applied to an AISI 304 substrate using flame spraying (FS) combined with surface flame melting (SFM) is studied. Remelting after spraying improved the mechanical and tribological {{properties of the}} coatings. Microstructural characterization using XRD, SEM and EDS indicated that alumina additions produced similar phases (NiSi, Ni 3 B, CrC and Ni 31 Si 12) regardless of the alumina size, but the phases differed in morphology, size distribution and relative proportions from one coating to another. The addition of 12 wt. % nanometric Al 2 O 3 increased the phases concentration more than five- to sixfold and reduced the hard phases size about four-to threefold compared with NiCrBSi + 12 wt. % micrometric Al 2 O 3. Nanoalumina led to reduced mass loss during abrasive wear compared to micrometric alumina and greater improvement in hardness...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} elucidates {{the effect}} of coating thickness and material property difference between the <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> and the steel substrate on the residual stress profiles produced by laser cladding that in turn explains the differences in fatigue life of the laser clad samples. The outcomes of this research offers a more comprehensive assessment approach that aids {{in the selection of}} coating material relative to substrate material to control fatigue life and crack propagation in a structure constructed by laser cladding and have the potential to be incorporated in the design of laser cladding for critical engineering components...|$|R
40|$|Hardfacing is {{a widely}} {{diffused}} technique adopted to increase service life of parts for heavy-duty applications. Even though <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> feature optimized chemistry and microstructure for specific service conditions, dilution with substrate modifies the resulting properties along a significant fraction of the deposit thickness. In particular, C and B diffusion to the substrate alters hypereutectic alloys reducing the carbide-forming ability andmodifying the solidification sequence. In the present paper, the effect of dilution on a hypereutectic Fe-C-B based alloy containing Cr and Mo was investigated. The effect of dilution on the reference alloy was studied by producing laboratory castings with an increased amount of Fe, up to 50 mass...|$|R
40|$|Steel-based <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are welded}} onto the outside {{diameter}} of tool joints in three beads {{with a slight}} overlap between welds for underground drilling to prolong the tool joints’ life. Current <b>hardfacing</b> <b>alloys</b> have a shortened life due to cracks occurring in neighboring weld beads. To decrease cracking, the effects of composition and heat treatment on the microstructure was investigated on five alloys. Five small arc-melt circular ingots roughly 1. 4 x 0. 3 inches were produced. Each sample had varying amounts of C, B, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Si, Ti, V, and W. The carbon levels in the alloys were. 91 wt%,. 98 wt%, and 3 wt% resulting in a ferritic, martensitic, and austenitic matrix, respectively. The heat treated samples were solutionized at 1100 °C for 2 hours, quenched followed by an aging treatment at 500 °C for 5 hours and air cooled. Metallographic analysis was performed revealing the as cast microstructures to have a fine appearance compared to the coarser nature of the heat treated microstructures. Hardness values were measured {{and the effect of}} heat treatment on the ferritic and austenitic samples’ hardness was minimal. Increasing the weight percent of Nb in the ferritic alloy prohibited grain growth resulting in slight changes in hardness after heat treatment, while increasing the weight percent of Ti had little effect. The martensitic sample decreased in hardness from 61 to 49 HRC due to the reduction in strain from heat treatment. Micro-hardness data revealed similar trends. Nano-hardness is suggested to understand microstructural evolution and measure ferrite hardness...|$|R
