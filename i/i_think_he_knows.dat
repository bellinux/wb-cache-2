500|$|Peirsol {{qualified}} {{for his first}} Olympics {{at the age of}} seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, [...] "I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I don't--but for Manfredi's sake, of course, I do. But for his sake {{more than}} my own, I admit. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes, for {{a little}} while, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where he is, {{but most of the}} time he lies {{perfectly}} still, or just talks to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is but {{wood dust}} which I {{use for the}} {{cleaning}} of my nails," [...] cried Masapo, for he was so terrified <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> not what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the old feller; {{the one in}} {{the cart}} there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was runnin' away, though he didn't say {{anything}} about it; but he looked just as if he did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're taking Jimmy's road. He was {{the last}} man to come down here, and I wonder what he was {{thinking}} about," [...] he said. [...] "There would have been an ice fringe along the bank, and Jimmy was hungry. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't get through, and it was only because of the woman he held on so tight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, a great deal; but it's {{more for}} literature," [...] said Pansy--"and for conversation. But papa cares also for those things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maccario {{turned to}} Appleby. “Our friend walks fast. It is counted a four days’ journey. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that one seldom gains {{anything}} by trifling with the Sin Verguenza.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; but I {{really should}} enjoy showing him the old armour. He was {{asking me about}} it this morning. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> nearly {{as much of it}} as we do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton smiled gravely. [...] "It {{comes to}} all of us one day, and the trail of the treasure-seeker leads most often to the unknown hunting grounds," [...] he said. [...] "We have got to keep faith with Jimmy. He did his best, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> would come up here after him." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{drew her}} to him and she laid {{her head on his}} shoulder, murmuring, 'Ah! father, father, were you but here to see it. So desolate yesterday, so ineffably blest today. Oh! I cannot even grieve for him now, save that he could not just have seen us; yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it would be so.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... “… it {{was also}} true {{that he could have}} been better known and many people were aware of this. It was not in his nature to seek the limelight, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needed the peace and quiet which allowed him to produce the wonderful, {{sensitive}} and ‘innocent’ works which he did. Over exposure would have destroyed his talent and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{rather a}} big dog for the house, but I can't keep {{him away from}} me," [...] she explained. [...] "As you see, he has lost a foot, in a trap, and he was marked for {{destruction}} when I asked for him. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that I saved his life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am fonder of Fanny--and, of course, of you, Mrs Bowater; oh, far, far. But--I don't {{quite know}} how to express it--I am, as you might say, {{in my own mind}} with him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> a little what I am, in myself I mean. And besides, oh, well, it isn't a miserable thing to feel that just one's company makes anybody happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take it to Mr. Dutton, Billy-boy; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> how {{the flowers}} {{came into the}} garden. You shall have daddy's button-hole to take to him next. There, Mark, it is a pansy of most smiling countenance, such as should beam on you through your accounts. I declare, there's that paragon of a Mr. Jones helping Bessy to bring in dinner! Isn't it very kind to provide a man-servant for us?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't help {{hearing what}} Mr Spence {{was saying to}} you about Sheen, sir. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> quite what really happened." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in CounterPunch, author Tariq Ali said, [...] "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>he</b> was saying and why. In a neo-liberal world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of Mike Davis), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith. The reaction in the Muslim world was predictable, but depressingly insufficient." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in CounterPunch, he responded to the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy and said: [...] "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>he</b> was saying and why. In a neo-liberal world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of Mike Davis), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith.

6000|$|... "There are {{twenty of}} them yet. He has come too early," [...] said Flora Schuyler, {{with a glance}} at the clock. [...] "Any way, you must {{understand}} {{what you are going to}} do. It was Clavering arranged this, but your father knew what he was doing and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything. If you leave this house to-night, Hetty, everybody will know you warned Larry, and it will make a great difference to you. It will gain you the dislike of all your friends and place a barrier between you and your father which, I think, will never be taken away again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mohun wrote, 'Lily and I {{enjoyed your}} letter together. Dolly looks {{all the better}} for country life, though I am afraid she has not learnt to relish it, nor to {{assimilate}} with the Merrifield children as I expected. I don't think Lily has quite fathomed her as yet, but 'cela viendra' with patience, only mayhap not without a previous explosion. I fancy {{it takes a long}} time for an only child to settle in among a large family. It was a great pity you could not see Lily yourself. To my dismay I encountered Flinders in the street at Darminster last week. I believe he is on the staff of a paper there, happily Dolly does not know it, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where she is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{about as}} usual, Squire. Bob {{is not such}} a good judge of horses and cattle as George was, but in other respects <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more. George did not care for reading, and Bob is always at the papers and getting up the last things these {{scientific}} chaps have found out; so matters are pretty well squared. Altogether, I have no call to grumble, and I ain't likely, Squire, to have to ask for time on rent day. We were worried sorely about George as long as that matter hung over him; but since that was cleared up, and we heard of his having saved your life, we have been happy again. We got a big shock yesterday, however, when we heard what had happened out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't know you. And, what is more, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{much of your}} father. Don't go to him yet." [...] And Herbert {{promised that}} he would not.|$|R
6000|$|... "From me he {{has learned}} nothing," [...] said Janet; [...] "nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more than what the public in general believe of your situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew is in {{love with}} her himself," [...] Madge said firmly; [...] "though <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it yet. Dick's delightful, but the girl would never be {{satisfied}} with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Reddy Fox hunts with ears, {{eyes and}} nose," [...] {{continued}} Peter. [...] "Many a time I've watched him {{listening for the}} squeak of Danny Meadow Mouse or watching for the grass to move and show where Danny was hiding; and many a time he has found my scent with his wonderful nose and followed me just as Bowser the Hound follows him. I guess there isn't much going on that Reddy's eyes, ears and nose don't tell him. But it is Reddy's quick wits {{that the rest of}} us fear most. We never know what new trick he will try. Lots of enemies are easy to fool, but Reddy isn't one of them. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more about me than I know about myself. I guess it is just pure luck that he hasn't caught me with some of those smart tricks of his.|$|E
60|$|Here I sit at {{the desk}} again, {{watching}} his eye--humbly watching his eye, as he rules a ciphering-book for another victim whose hands have just been flattened by that identical ruler, and {{who is trying to}} wipe the sting out with a pocket-handkerchief. I have plenty to do. I don't watch his eye in idleness, but because I am morbidly attracted to it, in a dread desire to know what he will do next, and whether it will be my turn to suffer, or somebody else's. A lane of small boys beyond me, with the same interest in his eye, watch it too. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it, though he pretends he don't. He makes dreadful mouths as he rules the ciphering-book; and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane, and we all droop over our books and tremble. A moment afterwards we are again eyeing him. An unhappy culprit, found guilty of imperfect exercise, approaches at his command. The culprit falters excuses, and professes a determination to do better tomorrow. Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he beats him, and we laugh at it,--miserable little dogs, we laugh, with our visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into our boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll believe I'm {{glad to see}} {{you when}} I tell you it's only because I knew you were to be here that I came myself. I don't come and see my brother--I make him come and see me. This hill of his is impossible--I don't see what {{possesses}} him. Really, Osmond, you'll be the ruin of my horses some day, and if it hurts them you'll have to give me another pair. I heard them wheezing to-day; I assure you I did. It's very disagreeable to hear one's horses wheezing when one's sitting in the carriage; it sounds too as if they weren't what they should be. But I've always had good horses; whatever else I may have lacked I've always managed that. My husband doesn't know much, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> a horse. In general Italians don't, but my husband goes in, according to his poor light, for everything English. My horses are English--so it's all the greater pity they should be ruined. I must tell you," [...] she went on, directly addressing Isabel, [...] "that Osmond doesn't often invite me; I don't think he likes to have me. It was quite my own idea, coming to-day. I like to see new people, and I'm sure you're very new. But don't sit there; that chair's not what it looks. There are some very good seats here, but there are also some horrors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I can't say. I am told he's very {{reserved}} on the matter. Those {{sellers of}} spirits are great scoundrels generally. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{more of it}} than anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "After all, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{any more than}} a ghost what he pays it for: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> gets fresh {{instructions}} every time. But, any ways, there it was, all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mayson smiled. [...] "Stannard {{dared not}} cheat me, and perhaps I can give Mr. Deering the light <b>he</b> wants. I <b>knew</b> {{something}} about Stannard that, had others known, would have broken him. When {{we made our}} agreement, he declared the person he had injured was recently dead and the risk he ran was gone. Perhaps he was sincere, but sometimes I doubt. Not long since, {{when he began to}} keep back sums I ought to have got, I made inquiries and found out that another knew. In fact, it looked as if Stannard were buying the fellow's silence with my money. Had he been frank, I might have broken the extortioner, but he was not frank. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had deceived me about the agreement and was afraid. Anyhow, he tried to meet the demands, until----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Tazza and Thieves {{leading lady}} Kim Hye-soo {{described}} him as [...] "a genius who also works extremely hard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> who he is, the exact kind of films {{that he wants to}} make, and how to make them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Galileo {{is known}} for his relaxed, {{professional}} behaviour and even temperament. Noel Stapleton, his long-time handler at Coolmore Stud, calls him a creature of habit. [...] "He is a true gentleman," [...] said Stapleton, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> how important he is." ...|$|E
5000|$|Calling Choi [...] "a genius {{who also}} works {{extremely}} hard," [...] actress Kim Hye-soo was in awe {{when she first}} read the script, saying, [...] "It {{was a product of}} great effort, genius ideas and a detail-oriented, calculative mind. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> who he is, the exact kind of films that he wants to make, and how to make them. The Thieves proves it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went into}} the yard to get Orso. He was lying down when I {{approached}} him, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> from my general appearance that I was prepared to take the road, and he {{rose to his feet}} as much as to say, [...] "I am ready." [...] I unfastened the chain from the post, and, with the best of wishes for good-luck from John, who now seemed to be very well satisfied with me, I walked {{around the side of the}} house, the bear following as submissively as if he had been used to my leadership all his life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's my father, my dear,' said Mr. Weller, turning with an {{explanatory}} air to {{the young}} lady in the bar; 'blessed if <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> hardly <b>knows</b> wot my other name is. Well, young brockiley sprout, wot then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he didn't {{understand}} your joking, father. He's a foreigner, and shy and proud, and--not like the others. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{what you meant}} then, {{any more than he}} believed he was making a bargain before. He may be poor, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> been--a--a--gentleman." ...|$|R
