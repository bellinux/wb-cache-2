'In every country in which communism has taken over,' he reminded the Senate, 'the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.' He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.' 'Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, he could not have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> for them.' 'This is a colossal innocence, indeed.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location. [...] Alberta plans to widen the southwest leg of the road, which is well over capacity, but the plans are currently unfunded until at least 2020. [...] They include widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between Highway 2 and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way. [...] In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton. Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, [...] "If we built a six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10years, that wouldn’t be money well spent." ...|$|E
500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E

They explained, [...] "Super Mario 64 is the first true 3D game to play {{as good as the}} 2D games of the 16-bit era. ... As such, it represents the new high-water mark of both gameplay and graphic sophistication." [...] GameSpot called it one of the 15 most influential games of all time, and rated the Nintendo 64 version a score of 9.4 and the Wii Virtual Console version an 8. Game Informer commented that even a decade later the game still offers hours of entertainment. They also commented on the camera system, stating that by present-day standards the camera system [...] "would almost be considered broken". Game Revolution's retrospective review referred to the graphics as [...] "beautiful", but criticized the camera angles, saying [...] "it doesn't work as well as it should". The game placed 6th in Official Nintendo Magazines [...] "100 greatest Nintendo games of all time". In 2009, Game Informer put Super Mario 64 13th on their list of [...] "The Top 200 Games of All Time". Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the game as a [...] "masterpiece of game design", stating that Nintendo was able to take its [...] "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D". Michael Grayford of Liquid Entertainment stated he was initially [...] "very turned off" [...] by the openness of the game the first time he played it. Upon playing it later, he was [...] "highly pleased" [...] and stated [...] "each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored". Warren Spector, former lead designer at Ion Storm, stated it was [...] "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" [...] and [...] "no game has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it". He also praised the exploration aspect of the game, commenting that [...] " [...] explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".|$|E

[...] Not content with his explanation, Stewart showed videos in which Cramer recommended ways to drive down stock prices by spreading false rumors, deceiving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and deliberately misleading journalists. Cramer admitted that he can do better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E

[...] According to the Austin American-Statesman, the refs [...] "blew the call" [...] stating that replays showed that Sweed was involved in some [...] "spirited hand checking while the ball was in the air, but neither player appeared to push or be guilty of interference". [...] All three broadcasters working the game for ABC also initially spoke out against the penalty call, although later acknowledging that enough interference had occurred to justify the call.

And (2) when a student not only knows that his or her own peer grading efforts are being examined by peers, but he or she is also given a number of other peer grading efforts to evaluate (so the peer graders see how other peer graders evaluate assignments), do both of these together tend to motivate the student to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> when grading assignments?
