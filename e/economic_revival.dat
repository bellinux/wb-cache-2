5|$|A New Day for Detroit - about Detroit's recent sports renaissance and <b>economic</b> <b>revival,</b> {{focusing}} {{on the construction of}} the Little Caesars Arena in Midtown Detroit, the future home of the Pistons (who had played at The Palace of Auburn Hills since 1988) and the Red Wings (who had played at the Joe Louis Arena since 1979), which will mean both teams' 2017–2018 seasons will be first time since the Lions' move to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1975 (and subsequent return to Detroit when they moved to Ford Field in 2002), that all four of Detroit's major professional teams will play in the city. It premiered on April 28, 2017 and was narrated by Oscar-winning actor and Detroit native J. K. Simmons.|$|E
5|$|Logging was Seattle's {{first major}} industry, {{but by the}} late 19th century, the city had become a {{commercial}} and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s, with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an <b>economic</b> <b>revival,</b> which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces {{to achieve an}} <b>economic</b> <b>revival</b> that {{continued}} until {{the close of the}} century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous {{than at any time since}} the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century, population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the Genoese and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with the Empire via Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|In 1878, a {{weaving mill}} was founded, and in 1905, a brewery, sawmill and iron foundry began operations. There were 1616 craftsmen, which {{included}} 470 seamstresses, 250 tailors and 230 furriers. At {{the beginning of}} the twentieth century Khmilnyk had undergone social changes. The economic decay of 1907-1910 was interspersed some <b>economic</b> <b>revivals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the Great Depression skyscrapers {{construction}} {{suffered a}} hiatus for {{over thirty years}} due to <b>economic</b> problems.

50|$|But no {{invasion}} {{can stop}} the <b>economic</b> and cultural <b>revival</b> of this fertile land. People gradually returned to old ruins, bringing life and new hope with them. And {{in the year of}} 1305 the city of Cherkasy was first mentioned in Hustynskyi Manuscript together with Kiev, Kaniv, Zhytomyr, and Ovruch.|$|R
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of the}} century. During Japan's military buildup in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's <b>economic</b> <b>revival</b> strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E
5|$|As Western Europe {{witnessed}} {{the formation of}} new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an <b>economic</b> <b>revival</b> that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with the Sasanian Empire, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted {{throughout most of the}} 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics {{that they did not have}} in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Codex Theodosianus—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542 led to the rest of Justinian's reign concentrating on defensive measures rather than further conquests.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} in an <b>economic</b> <b>revival</b> {{that had begun}} {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E
50|$|A general <b>economic</b> {{and civic}} <b>revival</b> has been {{underway}} since the mid-nineties. Liverpool's economy has grown {{faster than the}} national average and its crime levels have remained lower than most other metropolitan areas in England and Wales, with recorded crime per head in Merseyside comparable to the national average — unusually low for an urban area.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Guardia di Finanza {{is to protect the}} legal economy and the {{businesses}} operating in compliance with the law, while ensuring that the Republic, the European Union, the regions, and the local governments can rely on a regular inflow and appropriate use of the resources meant for the community, and for supporting policies for <b>economic</b> and social <b>revival</b> and development.|$|R
50|$|There {{are growing}} calls for wider <b>economic</b> and social <b>revival</b> of the territories around the {{disaster}} zone. For instance, special technologies are suggested for agriculture and energy projects that would avoid {{the danger of}} proliferating polluted material. The most vocal advocate of such revival was the then President Viktor Yuschenko who has expressed his deep concerns with the exclusion of polluted territories from the society and economy of Ukraine.|$|R
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the failure of negotiations and of the <b>economic</b> <b>revival,</b> the Secession League gradually lost support and by 1938 had ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, Dorchester has had {{periods of}} <b>economic</b> <b>revival</b> and recession. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dorchester was {{particularly}} hard hit by economic recession, high unemployment, and white flight.|$|E
25|$|The Haskalah, the {{movement}} of thought inspired by the Jewish Enlightenment, touched the Ottoman world {{at the end of}} the 19th century, after its spread among Jewish populations of Western and Eastern Europe.

50|$|Despite some <b>revival,</b> <b>economic</b> {{growth is}} still low: the Jamaican Government is {{forecasting}} real {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) growth of 1.9 per cent {{for the fiscal year}} 2015/2016 and the country continues to be confronted by serious social issues that predominantly affect youth, such as high levels of crime and violence and high unemployment. Jamaica, which had seen its poverty rate drop almost 20 percent over two decades, saw it increase by eight percent in a few years.|$|R

25|$|Collins bequeathed to posterity a {{considerable}} body of writing: essays, speeches and tracts, articles and official documents {{in which he}} outlined plans for Ireland's <b>economic</b> and cultural <b>revival,</b> {{as well as a}} voluminous correspondence, both official and personal. Selections have been published in The Path to Freedom (Mercier, 1968) and in Michael Collins in His Own Words (Gill & Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Seán Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins's ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland's economy.|$|R

40|$|The specialists paid {{a special}} {{attention}} to credit growth in the transitions countries due to its sharp increase during the last years. However, once the financial crisis started in 2008, the credit activity evolution reversed. Consequently, forecasting the credit trend has become a subject {{of interest in the}} context of the present financial and economic conditions, because the credit market blockage has a negative impact on <b>economic</b> activity <b>revival</b> and leads to the amplification of the uncertainty on financial markets. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the recent credit developments in Romania and to predict their future evolution. Based on the credit growth rate endogenous factors and using a stochastic simulation econometric model, we demonstrate that this economy experiences a passage from a credit boom to a severe credit crunch. The forecasting exercise results show a credit activity contraction up to the end of 2009, demolishing the expectations related to a near economic recovery in Romania. ...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century Pontevedra {{was little more than a}} small backward town. Fishing, arts and crafts kept the economy going. Yet, with the establishment of new provincial divisions in 1833 Pontevedra suddenly saw itself transformed into a provincial capital. Pontevedra then grew and slowly became an administrative centre. The introduction of the railway also reconnected the city with the rest of the country, after having lost its harbour. All in all, Pontevedra sees in this century a cultural, <b>economic</b> and urban <b>revival.</b> It is in Pontevedra when, in 1853, Xoán Manuel Pintos publishes the first book in modern Galician, [...] "A gaita gallega".|$|R

The physical transformation includes an implementation of diverse styles of sustainable architecture (a shift from red and gray social housing projects), expanding and reconnecting the road networks to the Toronto Transit Commission as well as new streets and alleys maintained by the City. It also means adding new parks, open space, retail locations, and a new arts complex.According to Toronto Housing, before revitalization there were 7,500 tenants living in 2,083 rent-geared-to-income (RGI) units.|$|R
