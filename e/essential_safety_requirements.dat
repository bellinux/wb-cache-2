The EU ATEX 100 A Directive 94 / 9 /EC has introduced <b>Essential</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Requirements</b> and a categorisation system. EN 954, under the Machinery Directive, has a different categorisation system for safety-related devices. A categorisation system needs to be developed which is compatible with these and with standards for safety-critical control systems, such as IEC 61508. Objectives (1) To draft a description of appropriate subdivisions of safety devices. (2) To define all safety devices which {{are used in the}} context of electrical equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres and study their characteristics and performance in terms of the defined subdivisions. (3) To draft a method for identifying when a particular subdivision should be used, taking into account the application and working environment of the equipment.

Five measurement planes were to be measured with PIV, 3 in a 3 C-PIV and 2 in a 2 C-PIV arrangement. Sample example result of the PIV data are given in figure 1. The set-up of the 3 C-PIV and 2 C-PIV meas-urement is chosen such that the cameras and laser light sheet for successive planes can be traversed. This en-ables fast calibrations during the measurement. A com-prehensive dataset of PIV results is obtained: for each PIV measurement point 500 image pairs are acquired. The numerical calculations are performed with a hybrid RANS TAU code employing an implicit Backward-Euler with LUSGS-Relaxation for the time discretization and a central method after Jameson for the space discretization. In order to adhere to the flow physics a low dissipative combina-tion of a scalar and matrix dissipation is used. The Spalart-Allmaras one-equation with Edwards-modification is used for the turbulence modelling.

The {{purpose of}} Directive 97 / 23 /EC is to {{harmonize}} European national laws regarding design, manufacture and conformity assessment of pressure equipment and assemblies (vessels, storage containers, heat exchangers, shell and water tube boilers, industrial pipework, safety devices and pressure accessories) subject {{to an internal}} pressure greater than 0. 5 bar. In the Directive, equipment is categorized within four levels (I to VI) according to degree of hazard: category III and IV equipment will require conformity assessment by 'notified bodies ' and 'recognised third party organisations ' (NDT personnel {{must be approved by}} a third party organisation recognized by a member state pursuant to Article 13). Equipment manufactured to Harmonized European standards developed in support of the directive will be presumed to comply with the <b>essential</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> For example: EN 13445 (Unfired Pressure Vessels) part 5 - Inspection and testing – requires at clause 6. 1. 3. 5. 7 (Qualification of NDT personnel) that NDT personnel shall be qualified and certified in accordance with EN 473 except for visual examination and leak testing (for which personnel shall be qualified but not certified). So, the qualification and certification requirements for NDT personnel as specified in the harmonized standards are clear, but what are the requirements for NDT personnel when a harmonized standard is not invoked? This paper will discuss the requirements of the Directive in terms of approval of NDT personnel, and explain what those bodies notified as ‘Recognised Third Party Organisations ’ will require in order to award ‘Approvals ’ to personnel that are not certificated by a RTPO in accordance with EN 473 (Reference 3), a harmonized standard...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{technical}} and economic feasibility of the installation of an innovative thermal concentrating solar system (TCSS) for high pressure steam production in a dairy is discussed. The production of soft cheese takes place thanks to the injection of saturated steam into washtubs that are filled with semi-finished materials. The steam is produced in natural gas fired tube boilers and is evidently lost and make-up fresh treated water at atmospheric conditions is required. In this context, the installation of a TCSS based on the technology of the linear Fresnel concentrating systems is proposed to provide part of the required steam and, consequently, to reduce the consumption of the fossil fuel improving the process environmental performances. To this purpose, the piping integration {{of the new system}} in the original one has been analyzed in detail respecting the <b>essential</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> in accordance with the guidelines of the Pressurized Equipment Directive (PED) and maintaining the required service level to the thermal end-user. In order to assure a satisfying exploitation of the solar power source, the adoption of a storage system based on a pressurized vessel containing a mixture of water and steam has been considered and optimized from a technical and economic point of view. Indeed, the dairy production is scheduled only during six hours in the morning per day. This particular thermal load profile makes difficult the integration with the not programmable solar power source with peaks during the median hours of the day. Particular attention has been dedicated to the operative behavior of the integrated system defining suitable control rules thanks to the installation of valves and sensors. Beside the technical analysis, an economic assessment has demonstrated the profitability of the thermal plant modification, that assures a substantial improvement of the overall energy efficiency of the production process...|$|E
40|$|Limiting {{the risk}} of {{external}} fire spread between buildings {{is one of the}} <b>essential</b> fire <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> in the UK following from the performance objectives set in the 2010 Building Regulations, Approved Document B. Although, in principle, any engineering solution that fulfils this requirement is considered acceptable, the methods given in BR 187 (UK guidance document for external fire spread) are commonly applied and accepted by the authorities. The BR 187 methods can be used to determine either a required separation distance between two buildings for a given area of unprotected façade, or a maximum allowable unprotected area of the façade for a given distance between the two buildings. The safety level which is achieved by the BR 187 methodology is unknown and the beneficial effects of sprinklers are only taken into account indirectly and without clear justification. In this paper a methodology and calculation tool are presented that allow the building’s designer to directly calculate radiation intensities along the site-boundary or the opposite façade, and to evaluate the probability of fire spread between buildings due to high radiation values. Through probabilistic considerations and Monte Carlo simulations it is argued that the inclusion of sprinklers in a building significantly reduces {{the risk of}} reaching high radiation values at the opposite façade or at the site boundary, resulting in a higher level of safety as compared to a traditional design compliant with BR 187 where a fraction of the façade has been fire rated. Consequently, opting for sprinklers results both in a safer design and allows a larger fraction of the façade to be unprotected.

40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} heart activity {{based on}} implantable accelerometer devices {{have been demonstrated}} as efficient method that could provide higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional electrocardiography (ECG) method. The method can be specified for detection of ischemia on patient who has undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. The current implantable accelerometer devices are sutured to the heart surface {{and have to be}} removed before closing the patient’s chest since the device dimension is not suitable for closed chest implantation. According to a surgical point of view, a heart muscle implantable accelerometer device can properly present the heart motion without interfering with surrounding organs. The device can be suitable for both intraoperative and postoperative monitoring procedures. However, the heart muscle implantation requires miniaturization of the device to provide minimal tissue trauma and simple implantation procedure. This study focuses on development of a MEMSbased 3 -axis heart muscle implantable accelerometer device. The device is to be implanted into the heart muscle, remain in place after the thorax is closed, and be pulled out though an opening in chest wall after a few days when the intensive care is no longer needed. Five different versions of the heart muscle implantable accelerometer device were proposed and developed with regards to the prerequisites for the heart implantable medical devices including the regulatory compliances, and the clinical demands and the requirements of device components. These devices were categorised into two main groups built on two different commercial accelerometer sensors. In comparison to the earlier implantable accelerometer device, the dimensions of these five versions were significantly reduced in this study. The overall diameter of earlier device was 11 mm which was far different from the 3. 2 mmdiameter of the first version device and 2. 0 mmdiameter of the fifth version. A novel structure of heart muscle implantable accelerometer device was first conducted in the second version device which has been able to corporate with the pacing/sensing functionality as a temporary pacing wire. This study also suggested specific experimental set-ups for qualifying <b>essential</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> (e. g. leakage current, tensile strength, flexural endurance, insulation strength) based on the standards and regulation for the implantable devices. Tests of the complete devices showed leakage currents are at least 1000 times less than the limit for heart implantable applications. This study also pointed out that the pulling strength of a device is important for accomplishing the implantation and removal of the device. Different versions of device provided different pulling strength which varied from 12 N up to 100 N. The muscle-implantation stability of different versions were demonstrated in this study depend on the device dimension, encapsulation structure, cable flexibility and the implantation method. The implantation procedures of different device versions and quality of the acceleration signals were verified and validated in several animal trials reported in detail in this stud...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{industry}} {{has the highest}} potential for occupational hazard events among all United States??? industries. One of the major causes is construction employers or employees??? negative attitudes toward <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by different construction safety documents, such as construction safety regulations and project safety plans. Such attitudes towards <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> include ignorance, negligence and disobedience and the first two {{can be dealt with}} by raising construction project participants??? awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> through better construction safety planning. The huge number of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> from different construction safety documents may hinder project participants from carefully searching through them for identifying applicable <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> In addition, current approaches and tools for raising awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> are not sufficient. For example, traditional keyword-based search through a large number of construction safety specifications can help find <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> which contain the search keywords. However, there will be other requirements which are semantically relevant but are not found just because they do not contain these specific keywords. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a formalized approach to automating the identification of applicable construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> This approach should enable identifying <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> more efficiently (i. e. saving time in the identification process) and effectively (i. e. better identify both directly and inferentially relevant requirements), and make it feasible to more easily raise project participants??? awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> To address the above need, a Construction Safety Documents Management Framework is developed in this research. The developed Framework comprises the following components: (1) a computer interpretable model for representing <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> of construction <b>safety</b> documents to enable automated reasoning about them; (2) a semantically-rich model for representing concepts acquired from construction safety documents which describe contextual information to which the imposed requirements apply; and (3) reasoning mechanisms to reason about the above two models for evaluating concepts and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements???</b> applicability to given project contexts. For the representation of construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> the Ordered Hierarchy of Content Object (OHCO) approach is adopted to build the representation model; Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used in this research to implement the OHCO-based model. Ontological modeling, on the other hand, is leveraged to model semantically-rich concepts that describe construction contexts. In addition, the developed reasoning mechanisms utilize the ontological relationships between modeled concepts to automatically evaluate each concept???s applicability. Construction <b>safety</b> <b>requirements???</b> applicability then can be evaluated by reasoning about the requirements??? applicability conditions and exceptions, which are represented using concepts defined in the concept ontologies. <b>Safety</b> <b>requirements</b> can be classified according to their evaluated applicability. The approach is validated for Job Hazard Analysis documents through computational experiments in multiple representation and reasoning test cases. The validation results show that the developed Framework can successfully evaluate the applicability of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by these JHA documents and identify <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> applicable to given contexts. During the validation, the advantages, limitations and practical implications of the developed Framework are discovered.

40|$|Evidence {{has shown}} that the lack of {{traceability}} between <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> and both architecture and failure propagation models is a key reason for the incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> and, consequently, a root cause of safety incidents. In this regard, this paper presents checks for the automatic detection of incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> with respect to failure propagation models and architecture. First, the notion of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> completeness and consistency was decomposed into small manageable pieces called <b>Safety</b> <b>Requirement</b> Completeness and Consistency Criteria. Breaking the complex notions of completeness and consistency into finer grains was important to allow systematic and precise elaboration of the completeness and consistency checks. Next, each <b>Safety</b> <b>Requirement</b> Completeness and Consistency Criteria was formalized using Set Theory notation, which, despite being a lightweight formalism, is sufficiently accurate to represent problem-specific knowledge, and {{can be used as a}} solid basis for automation using different technology platforms. Last, in order to concretize the checks formalized with Set Theory notation, they were realized with OCL, chosen because its expressions do not have the ambiguity of natural languages and are not difficult to use in real development environments, unlike more formal specification languages such as Z. It has been observed that these checks are solid and practical enough to support safety engineers in detecting incomplete and inconsistent <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> and, consequently, for improving the detection of incompleteness and inconsistency of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> with respect to architecture and failure propagation models...|$|R
