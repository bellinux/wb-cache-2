Previous measurement technique of elastic constant has the limitation of application for thin film or polymer material because contact to specimen affects the result. Speckle pattern interferometry (SPI) has been developed as a noncontact optical measurement technique which can visualize resonance vibration mode shapes with whole-field. The maximum vibration amplitude at each vibration mode shape is a clue to find the resonance frequencies. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>constant</b> of test material can be easily estimated from vibration of a beam equation using the measured resonance frequencies.

Measuring changes in compressional (P) -wave and shear (S) -wave attenuation and velocity under uniaxial and triaxial compression tests revealed their effectiveness for distinguishing changes in applied load and structural failure of samples. The velocity and attenuation values were used in further calculations such as ratios of P-wave to S-wave values, <b>dynamic</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>constants,</b> normalized velocities, and attenuation coefficients to reveal trends for loading and failure.

In particular, P-wave and the S-wave velocities were studied {{in relation to}} different directions of propagation to foliation planes. As a non-destructive method of rock characterization ultrasonic methods allowed us to determine the values of <b>dynamic</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>constants,</b> which may be comparable to standard static <b>elastic</b> <b>constants</b> from the measurement of strain for instance using strain gauges. Ultrasonic evaluation of rock properties provides data on very small strains and provides a useful preliminary prediction of static properties. Several blocks of slate were taken from quarries located in the Synclinal Truchas in NW Spain. Anisotropy fabrics are present in these rocks as foliation planes.

The EdZ or EDZ changes the mechanical and hydromechanical properties which in return, constitute a potential risk for the performance of the geologic and/or engineered structures in the context of waste underground storage. Ultrasonic experiments have been implemented to characterize the EDZ extension around drifts and its evolution in time according to the structural support type (soft or rigid) and the environmental conditions.
