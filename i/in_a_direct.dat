5|$|Al-Adil aroused open hostility {{from the}} Hanbali lobby in Damascus for largely {{ignoring}} the Crusaders, having launched only one campaign against them. Al-Adil {{believed that the}} Crusader army could not be defeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> fight. Prolonged campaigns also involved the difficulties of maintaining a coherent Muslim coalition. The trend under al-Adil was the steady growth of the empire, mainly through the expansion of Ayyubid authority in al-Jazira and Armenia. The Abbasids eventually recognized al-Adil's role as sultan in 1207. A Crusader military campaign was launched on 3 November 1217, beginning with an offensive towards Transjordan. Al-Mu'azzam urged al-Adil to launch a counter-attack, but he rejected his son's proposal. In 1218, the fortress of Damietta in the Nile Delta was besieged by the Crusaders. After two failed attempts, the fortress eventually capitulated on 25 August. Six days later al-Adil died of apparent shock at Damietta's loss.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained {{reductions}} {{have established}} equivalences between many core problems with Õ(n^ 3) -time algorithms on n-node weighted graphs, such as Shortest Cycle, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Radius, Replacement Paths, Second Shortest Paths, and so on. These problems also have Õ(mn) -time algorithms on m-edge n-node weighted graphs, and such algorithms have wider applicability. Are these mn bounds optimal when m ≪ n^ 2 ? Starting from {{the hypothesis that}} the minimum weight (2 ℓ+ 1) -Clique problem in edge weighted graphs requires n^ 2 ℓ+ 1 -o(1) time, we prove that for all sparsities of the form m = Θ(n^ 1 + 1 /ℓ), there is no O(n^ 2 + mn^ 1 -ϵ) time algorithm for ϵ> 0 for any of the below problems: Minimum Weight (2 ℓ+ 1) -Cycle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> weighted graph, Shortest Cycle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> weighted graph, APSP <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> or undirected weighted graph, Radius (or Eccentricities) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> or undirected weighted graph, Wiener index of <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> or undirected weighted graph, Replacement Paths <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> weighted graph, Second Shortest Path <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> weighted graph, Betweenness Centrality of <b>a</b> given node <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> weighted graph. That is, we prove hardness for a variety of sparse graph problems from the hardness of a dense graph problem. Our results also lead to new conditional lower bounds from several related hypothesis for unweighted sparse graph problems including k-cycle, shortest cycle, Radius, Wiener index and APSP.

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Constantinople a {{few months}} later however, Michael VIII was able to focus his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> confrontation, as evidenced by the defeat of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing Venetian–Genoese war, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of Oreos in Negroponte (Euboea), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys. This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> line from previous kings, {{as would be}} the case in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E

5|$|Morris became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated with the}} idyllic Medievalist depictions of rural life {{which appeared in the}} paintings of the Pre-Raphaelites, and spent large sums of money purchasing such artworks. Burne-Jones shared this interest, but took it further by becoming an apprentice to one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelite painters, Dante Gabriel Rossetti; the three soon became close friends. Through Rossetti, Morris came to associate with poet Robert Browning, and the artists Arthur Hughes, Thomas Woolner, and Ford Madox Brown. Tired of architecture, Morris abandoned his apprenticeship, with Rossetti persuading him to take up painting instead, which he chose to do in the Pre-Raphaelite style. Morris aided Rossetti and Burne-Jones in painting the Arthurian murals at Oxford Union, although his contributions were widely deemed inferior and unskilled compared to those of the others. At Rossetti's recommendation, Morris and Burne-Jones moved in together to the flat at Bloomsbury's No. 17 Red Lion Square by November 1856. Morris designed and commissioned furniture for the flat in a Medieval style, much of which he painted with Arthurian scenes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> rejection of mainstream artistic tastes.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for 12hours Fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations, {{and began to}} weaken. The hurricane turned to the northwest on September 2 {{in response to a}} weakness in the subtropical ridge, a break caused by a mid-level circulation over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. After fading back to a Category3 hurricane, Fabian re-intensified on September 4, and regained Category4 status for a short time. The hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards Bermuda, a motion due to an approaching mid-level trough. As small pockets of dry air became entrained in the eyewall, Fabian weakened slightly, passing just 14miles (23km) west of Bermuda on September 5 as a 115mph (185km/h) Category 3 hurricane. The eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> hit; however, as the center did not move over the island, Fabian did not make landfall. After passing the island, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, and weakened to a 105mph (165km/h) Category2 hurricane on September 7. Steady weakening occurred as the hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear, drier air, and progressively cooler waters. On September 8, while located 680miles (1095km) east-northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm, with no deep convection remaining near the center. The extratropical remnant turned to the north on September 9, and on September 10 it merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern Greenland and Iceland.|$|E
