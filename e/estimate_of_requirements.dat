40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of dose-response evidence relevant for estimating vitamin B 12 <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> healthy adults and elderly people, considering different indicators of health: vitamin B 12 body stores, cognitive function, bone health, and biomarkers of vitamin B 12 status. Vitamin B 12 intakes needed to compensate daily losses may range from 3. 8 to 20. 7 μg/day depending on the assumptions used. The current evidence-base on cognitive function and bone health is too limited to estimate vitamin B 12 requirements. Evidence from controlled trials and observational studies on vitamin B 12 intake and biomarkers of vitamin B 12 status provided <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> average <b>requirements</b> between 0. 07 and 4. 1 μg/day, {{depending on the type of}} data and selected cut-off value indicating adequate vitamin B 12 status.

40|$|Aims: To (i) {{identify}} {{current practice}} of dietitians in determining energy and protein requirements {{for patients with}} Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD); and (ii) explore the magnitude and implications of the variability in estimates with reference to typical patients at each stage of PAD. Methods: An invitation to complete an online 26 -item questionnaire was distributed electronically by the Dietitians Association of Australia to all members. Each method used by participants for estimation of energy and protein requirements across the stages of PAD {{was applied to the}} relevant typical patient and the range <b>of</b> <b>estimates</b> reported. Results: Twenty-two dietitians completed the questionnaire and reported caseloads inclusive of all stages of PAD and with relatively equal frequency. For estimation <b>of</b> energy <b>requirements,</b> the Schofield equations in addition to 120 - 125 kJ/kg and 125 - 145 kJ/kg were most frequently used. When applied to the typical patient, the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> <b>requirements</b> varied by over 5000 kJ/day within each stage of PAD. For estimation <b>of</b> protein <b>requirements</b> it was common to apply the RDI (0. 8 - 1 g/kg/day) or account for minor surgery or sepsis (up to 1. 5 g/kg/day) for patients with rest pain or tissue loss. The <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>requirements</b> varied by up to 55 g/day depending on the method used. Conclusions: There was significant variation in energy and protein estimates both within and across the stages of PAD, which is possibly due to the little evidence available to inform dietitians on how to best treat patients with PAD. Further work is required to acquire a solid evidence base and subsequently communicate this for translation into practice. "...|$|R

One group of turkeys was fed to 3 wk using nutritionally adequate diets and fed test diets from 3 to 6 wk; another group of turkeys was fed to 6 wk using nutritionally adequate diets and fed test diets from 6 to 9 wk. Test diets were composed of peanut meal, soybean meal, corn, and grain sorghum as intact protein sources and were supplemented with amino acids. Peak performance of turkeys fed the test diets was equivalent to that of turkeys fed conventional corn-soybean meal diets for-mulated to meet NRC (1994) standards. <b>Estimates</b> <b>of</b> Thr <b>requirements</b> for weight gain were 0. 92 and 0. 86 % for 3 to 6 and 6 to 9 wk, respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of sowing date and cultivar on accumulated heat unit, phenology and yield of maize (Zea mays L.), a two-year field study was carried out at the Agricultural Research Station of College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.

The {{results of the present}} study showed that the highest and lowest seed yield was obtained from Hido cultivar at June 1 st planting date and NS 504 cultivar at July 15 th, respectively. Additionally, among the measured indices, crop heat unit (CHU), heat use efficiency (HUE) and relative thermal disparity (RTD) indices were able to <b>estimate</b> heat <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> maize cultivars accurately in different sowing dates and different phenological stages.
