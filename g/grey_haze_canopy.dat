60|$|As {{they climbed}} the path the mist grew thinner, till {{it was only}} a <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> at the top. There they were on the turfy lip of the land. The sky was fairly clear overhead. Below them the sea was singing hoarsely to itself.|$|R
60|$|A <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> {{stretched}} across the great river, which was also dim and grey, and odd wisps of pines rose raggedly beneath the white hills that cut against a gloomy, lowering sky. Deck-house, boat, and stanchion dripped, {{and every now and}} then the silence was broken by a doleful blast of the whistle. Nothing moved on the still, grey water; there was no sign of life ashore; and they seemed to be steaming into a great desolation.|$|R
60|$|Some of the {{passengers}} were of opinion that this firing came from Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose {{one after the other}} out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke. But my brother's attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant <b>grey</b> <b>haze.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ways {{in which}} the {{visually}} impaired are able to create art are giving new insights into the study of sight loss. For example, Ann Roughton is a landscape artist suffering from Macular Degeneration. Her paintings not only include what she can see with her partial vision, but her work also includes the <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> that she sees in the center in her vision {{as a result of her}} Macular Degeneration. In doing so, she is literally painting sight, giving a new perspective on sight loss.|$|R
60|$|He arose {{upon the}} invitation, and, {{dressing}} himself hastily, went forth and joined his little guide. The mountain maid tript lightly before him, through the <b>grey</b> <b>haze,</b> over hill and moor. It {{was a wild}} and varied walk, unmarked by any regular or distinguishable track, and keeping, upon the whole, {{the direction of the}} ascent of the brook, though without tracing its windings. The landscape, as they advanced, became waster and more wild, until nothing but heath and rock encumbered the side of the valley.|$|R
60|$|Yes; he {{was shocked}} at her worn and faded aspect. The image he had mentally carried out {{with him to the}} Cape he had brought home again as that of the woman he was now to rejoin. But another woman sat before him, and not the {{original}} Viviette. Her cheeks had lost for ever that firm contour which had been drawn by the vigorous hand of youth, and the masses of hair that were once darkness visible had become touched here and there by a faint <b>grey</b> <b>haze,</b> like the Via Lactea in a midnight sky.|$|R
60|$|Ida {{was still}} sitting among her bottles, with a lit {{cigarette}} in her left hand {{and a glass of}} stout on the table beside her. Clara, with another cigarette, was lounging in the easy chair with several maps spread out upon the floor around. Her feet were stuck up on the coal scuttle, and she had a tumblerful of some reddish-brown composition on the smoking table close at her elbow. The Doctor gazed {{from one to the other}} of them through the thin <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> of smoke, but his eyes rested finally in a settled stare of astonishment upon his elder and more serious daughter.|$|R

"Time passed; {{it seemed}} a moment, {{might have been an}} age; when from high in the golden <b>haze</b> that <b>canopied</b> this heaven, another angel came; its vans like East and West; a sunrise one, sunset the other.

50|$|Like all {{cities and}} towns in Anambra State, Ebenebe is in the {{tropical}} zone of Nigeria and experiences two distinct seasons {{brought about by the}} two predominant winds that rule the area: the southwestern monsoon winds from the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern dry winds from across the Sahara desert. The monsoon winds from the Atlantic creates seven months of heavy tropical rains, which occur between April and October and are followed by five months of dryness (November - March). The Harmattan, also known as Ugulu in the Igbo language, is a particularly dry and dusty wind which enters Nigeria in late December or {{in the early part of}} January. It is characterized by a <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> limiting visibility and blocking the sun's rays.|$|R
60|$|And now {{the morning}} arrived. The Ullathorne {{household}} was {{early on the}} move. Cooks were cooking in the kitchen long before daylight, and men were dragging out tables and hammering red baize on to benches at the earliest dawn. With what dread eagerness did Miss Thorne {{look out at the}} weather as soon as the parting veil of night permitted her to look at all! In this respect, at any rate, there was nothing to grieve her. The glass had been rising for the last three days, and the morning broke with that dull, chill, steady, <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> which in autumn generally presages a clear and dry day. By seven she was dressed and down. Miss Thorne knew nothing of the modern luxury of déshabilles. She would as soon have thought of appearing before her brother without her stockings as without her stays--and Miss Thorne's stays were no trifle.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{expanse of}} the Downs escarpment, {{so far as the}} <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> {{permitted}} him to see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger brother. They stirred with a stately motion before the south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted with the sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and Leith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving to rob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze. The purple heather was speckled with yellow gorse, and on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept behind, and dwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks that were swallowed up in haze.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the wind}} always coming {{from the left side}} (approximately from the north, for {{illustration}} see also Figure  4), the angles of the first quadrant (leeward right sector) were partly covered by contemporaneous ash clouds; hence, the trajectories of the ejecta could not be observed to the same extent as those ejected within the second observation quadrant (left sector). Also a part of the second quadrant was affected: the number of ejecta, which would - presuming a vertical conduit - be expected to be maximum at 0 ° (see vertical line in Figure  4), shows instead a maximum at 26 °. This {{can be explained by the}} increasing lack of visibility, indicated by the gradual <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> in Figure  4. As a consequence, we decided to focus on the statistics of the (apparently more significant) windward second quadrant, particularly for the ejection angles > 26 °, in order to find the flattest angle.|$|R
50|$|Awka {{is in the}} {{tropical}} rainforest zone of Nigeria and experiences two distinct seasons {{brought about by the}} two predominant winds that rule the area: the southwestern monsoon winds from the Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern dry winds from across the Sahara desert. The monsoon winds from the Atlantic creates six months of heavy tropical rains, which occur between April and July, followed by a short dry period in August lasting two to three weeks with the rain resuming in September and October. This is followed by five months of dryness (November - March) marked by a Harmattan wind, also known as Ugulu in Igbo, which is a particularly dry and dusty wind which enters Nigeria in late December or {{in the early part of}} January and is characterized by a <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> limiting visibility and blocking the sun's rays before dissipating and leading to extreme dry heat in the latter months of February and March.|$|R
60|$|A <b>grey</b> <b>haze,</b> {{thickened}} by {{the smoke}} of the city, drove out across the water when the Scarrowmania lay in the Mersey, with her cable hove short, and {{the last of the}} flood tide gurgling against her bows. A trumpeting blast of steam swept high aloft from beside her squat funnel, and the splash of the slowly turning paddles of the couple of steam tugs that lay alongside mingled with the din it made. A gangway from one of them led to the Scarrowmania's forward deck, and a stream of frowsy humanity that had just been released from overpacked emigrant boarding-houses poured up it. There were apparently representatives of all peoples and languages among that unkempt horde--Britons, Scandinavians, Teutons, Italians, Russians, Poles--and they moved on in forlorn apathy, like cattle driven to the slaughter. One wondered, from the look of them, how they had raised their passage money, and how many years' bitter self-denial it had cost them to provide for their transit to the land of promise.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was intensely, terribly hot. Looked at {{from the high}} ground where they were encamped above the river, the sea, {{a mile or two}} to her right--for this was the coast of Pondo-land--to little Rachel Dove staring at it with sad eyes, seemed an illimitable sheet of stagnant oil. Yet there was no sun, for a <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> hung like a veil beneath the arch of the sky, so dense and thick that its rays were cut off from the earth which lay below silent and stifled. Tom, the Kaffir driver, had told her that a storm was coming, a father of storms, which would end the great drought. Therefore he had gone to a kloof in the mountains where the oxen were in charge of the other two native boys--since on this upland there was no pasturage to drive them back to the waggon. For, as he explained to her, in such tempests cattle are apt to take fright and rush away for miles, and without cattle their plight would be even worse than it was at present.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed. [...] "It {{is better}} than honey, but you can't eat it!" [...] she said. [...] "Do you {{remember}} how the honey made {{you feel like a}} snake? This would make you see what I see if I put some of it on your eyes." [...] He begged her to do so, and she consenting poured a little into the palm of her hand. It was thick and white as milk; then taking some on her finger tip, she made him hold his eyes wide open while she rubbed it on the eye-balls. It made his eyes smart, and everything at first looked like a blue mist when he tried to see; then slowly the mist faded away and the air had a new marvellous clearness, and when he looked away over the plain beneath them he shouted for joy, so far could he see and so distinct did distant objects appear. At one point where nothing but the <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> that obscured the distance had been visible, a herd of wild cattle now appeared, scattered about, some grazing, others lying down ruminating, {{and in the midst of}} the herd a very noble-looking, tawny-coloured bull was standing.|$|R
60|$|And {{when these}} had {{vanished}} {{in the distance}} Graham heard a peewit wailing close at hand. He perceived he was now above the South Downs, and staring over his shoulder saw the battlements of Portsmouth Landing Stage towering over the ridge of Portsdown Hill. In another moment there came into sight a spread of shipping like floating cities, the little white cliffs of the Needles dwarfed and sunlit, and the grey and glittering waters of the narrow sea. They seemed to leap the Solent in a moment, {{and in a few}} seconds the Isle of Wight was running past, and then beneath him spread a wider and wide extent of sea, here purple with the shadow of a cloud, here grey, here a burnished mirror, and here a spread of cloudy greenish blue. The Isle of Wight grew smaller and smaller. In a few more minutes a strip of <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> detached itself from other strips that were clouds, descended out of the sky and became a coastline--sunlit and pleasant--the coast of northern France. It rose, it took colour, became definite and detailed, and the counterpart of the Downland of England was speeding by below.|$|R
40|$|In his winning {{entry for}} the Gavin Mooney Memorial Essay Competition, a Sydney GP argues that language, and {{different}} ways of knowing, have been {{getting in the way}} of action on climate change. “I DON’T believe in that climate change. ” I’d just got back from Darwin in early October. I and many of my GP colleagues had been closely following the news of the bushfires in New South Wales. We’d had our first warning of high fire danger in late September. As I returned to work in Campbelltown, in southwest Sydney, a <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> of smoke hung in the air. Each breath I took left a metallic reminder of the bushfires at the back of my throat. My patients were coughing more than usual. Those with asthma were getting through more inhalers. On behalf of patients, I’d been writing letters to the Department of Housing asking for modifications to keep people healthy, and even safe, in the weather extremes they were experiencing. It was what had been predicted. It was what was happening. So I was surprised to hear my patient say it… Read the full article Photo: Ash Cooper/ Flick...|$|R
60|$|They {{were ten}} days which I am {{not likely to}} forget. On the very day that the Eastern Star had cleared from the Thames, a furious easterly gale had sprung up, and blew on {{from day to day}} for the greater part of a week without the sign of a lull. Such a screaming, raving, long-drawn storm has never been known on the {{southern}} coast. From our hotel windows the sea view was all banked in haze, with a little rain-swept half-circle under our very eyes, churned and lashed into one tossing stretch of foam. So heavy was the wind upon the waves that little sea could rise, for the crest of each billow was torn shrieking from it, and lashed broadcast over the bay. Clouds, wind, sea, all were rushing to the west, and there, looking down at this mad jumble of elements, I waited on day after day, my sole companion a white, silent woman, with terror in her eyes, her forehead pressed ever against the window, her gaze from early morning to the fall of night fixed upon that wall of <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> through which the loom of a vessel might come. She said nothing, but that face of hers was one long wail of fear.|$|R

60|$|Next {{morning that}} memorable fog lifted, to England's joy, and quitting my refuge I went out once {{more into the}} region of high sheep-walks, adorned with beechen woods and traveller's-joy in the hedges, {{rambling}} by Highclere, Burghclere, and Kingsclere. The last--Hampshire's little Cuzco--is a small and village-like old red brick town, unapproached by a railroad and unimproved, therefore still beautiful, as were all places in other, better, less civilized days. Here {{in the late afternoon}} a chilly <b>grey</b> <b>haze</b> crept over the country and set me wishing for a fireside and the sound of friendly voices, and I turned my face towards beloved Silchester. Leaving the hills behind me I got away from the haze and went my devious way by serpentine roads through a beautiful, wooded, undulating country. And I wish that for a hundred, nay, for a thousand years to come, I could on each recurring November have such an afternoon ride, with that autumnal glory in the trees. Sometimes, seeing the road before me carpeted with pure yellow, I said to myself, now I am coming to elms; but when the road shone red and russet-gold before me I knew it was overhung by beeches. But the oak is the common tree in this place, and from every high point on the road I saw far before me and on either hand the woods and copses all a tawny yellow gold--the hue of the dying oak leaf. The tall larches were lemon-yellow, and when growing among tall pines produced a singular effect. Best of all was it where beeches grew among the firs, and the low sun on my left hand shining through the wood gave the coloured translucent leaves an unimaginable splendour. This was the very effect which men, inspired by a sacred passion, had sought to reproduce in their noblest work--the Gothic cathedral and church, its dim interior lit by many-coloured stained glass. The only choristers in these natural fanes were the robins and the small lyrical wren; but on passing through the rustic village of Wolverton I stopped {{for a couple of minutes}} to listen to the lively strains of a cirl-bunting among some farm buildings.|$|R

Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy {{implemented}} a camouflage painting program in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each {{identified with a}} number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. Not all United States Navy measures involved dazzle patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false bow wave on traditional <b>Haze</b> <b>Grey,</b> or Deck Blue replacing grey over part {{or all of the}} ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). Dazzle measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use dazzle, ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Warramunga was {{the fourth}} ship of the class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade.

As well as the ASMD upgrade, Warramunga was the first ship of the RAN to be painted with the polysiloxane-based <b>Haze</b> <b>Grey</b> paint, which has greater durability and infrared-reflection capabilities than the Storm Grey polyurethane paint used for the previous 60 years. A new ship's company (that of sister ship , which was docked for upgrading) was assigned on 31 March 2015, and the ship was relaunched on 8 April. On reentering service, the ship's homeport was changed to Fleet Base East, where she arrived on 2 September.|$|R
40|$|The <b>greying</b> and <b>hazing</b> of the {{population}} challenge many European countries. An important concern is het growing share of retirees compared {{to the number of}} active individuals. Therefore it is important to sustain the work participation of older workers. The capstone of an active aging policy does however not reduces to merely increasing legal retirement age. It should also be our ambition to improve working conditions that enable us to work longer in a healthy and enjoyable way. This dissertation aims to contribute to this overall goal by exploring both hindering and facilitating factors for a sustainable workforce participation of the elder. In the current aging society, insight in factors affecting the wage demands of mature age workers is of particular significance. Relying on well-established motivational theories we investigated in a first study the role of work motivation in shaping wage demands across the lifespan. The results of hierarchical regression analyses indicate that perceived attractiveness of working relates negatively to wage demands, whereas perceived expectancy about being able to find another job is positively related to wage demands. In addition, a relative intrinsic value orientation and a relative autonomous regulation style areassociated with lower wage demands. Finally, age moderates three out offour relationships. Whereas the impact of perceived attractiveness and a relative autonomous regulation style is stronger at older age, the impact of a relative intrinsic value orientation is stronger at younger age. This study provides insight in some (manageable) factors determining the wage older workers are willing to work for. More specifically, despite the finding that age is positively associated with wage demands, results suggest that when older workers regard work as an attractive alternative and experience volition in their work engagement, they are willing to make more financial concessions compared to their younger co-workers. In a second study we explored the impact of qualitative jobinsecurity- the overall feeling of the possibility of impaired quality of valuable work characteristics- on workers psychological well-being and behavioral engagement. The question arises is what qualitative job insecurity implies for the retention of older workers in the workforce: do older workers flight (i. e. withdraw from their work role by disengaging behaviorally) or fight (i. e. try to overcome qualitative losses in their work role by increasing behavioral engagement) ? Multi-Group Path Analysis reveals that qualitative job insecurity was negatively related topsychological wellbeing (as measured by basic need satisfaction) acrossall age groups, which in turn resulted in lower levels of behavioral engagement (as measured by organizational commitment behaviors). This effect was prominent across all age groups but most strongly among mature age workers (i. e. hindrance effect). We find a remaining positive path (i. e. challenge effect) to behavioral engagement (as measured by organizational commitment behaviors) that is equally strong across all age groups. We conclude that qualitative job insecurity is more hindering than challenging, in particular for older workers. Finally, also organizations can {{play an important role in}} the retention of older workers by means of their age-related human resource polices. A current debate concerns the added value of developmental and accommodative HR support. In a third study we explore the effectives of age-related HRM. More specifically, we investigate whether supervisors developmental and accommodative HR support fosters a more open-ended occupational future time perspective (FTP) among their mature age subordinates. An open-ended FTP is due its associations with growth-related goals an important criterion for active aging. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we rely on theJob Demands-Resources model and include job resources (i. e. job discretion and task variety), job demands (i. e. work pressure) and exhaustion as mediators. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses show that supervisors developmental support is positively related to shared perceived job resources; whereas accommodative support is unrelated to sharedperceived job demands. In turn, both job resources are negatively and work pressure is positively related to shared experiences of exhaustion. Results indicate that mature age workers FTP cannot be predicted by anyof the determinants at the between-level but is shaped by individual differences at the within-level. status: publishe...|$|R
