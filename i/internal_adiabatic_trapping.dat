40|$|The {{controversial}} {{problem of}} an isolated system with an <b>internal</b> <b>adiabatic</b> wall is investigated {{with the use}} of a simple microscopic model and the Boltzmann equation. In the case of two infinite volume one-dimensional ideal fluids separated by a piston whose mass is equal to the mass of the fluid particles we obtain a rigorous explicit stationary non-equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that at equal pressures on both sides of the piston, the temperature difference induces a non-zero average velocity, oriented toward the region of higher temperature. It thus turns out that despite the absence of macroscopic forces the asymmetry of fluctuations results in a systematic macroscopic motion. This remarkable effect is analogous to the dynamics of stochastic ratchets, where fluctuations conspire with spatial anisotropy to generate direct motion. However, a different mechanism is involved here. The relevance of the discovered motion to the adiabatic piston problem is discussed. Comment: 14 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

The method is demonstrated in an application to (111) interfaces in elemental Si, modeled with the classical Stillinger-Weber potential. The approach {{makes use of}} an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>trapping</b> procedure, and involves simulations of systems with coexisting solid and liquid phases separated by faceted interfaces containing islands with different sizes, for which the corresponding equilibrium temperatures are computed. We demonstrate that the calculated coexistence temperature is strongly affected by the geometry of the interface. We find that island radius is inversely proportional to superheating, allowing us to compute the step free energy by fitting simulation data within the formalism of classical nucleation theory. The approach outlined in this work paves {{the way to the}} calculation of step free energies relevant to the solidification of faceted crystals from liquid mixtures, as encountered in nanowire growth by the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism and in alloy casting.

The analysis is however very difficult because of the small but significant Geo-magnetic field and the spacecraft’s relative motion to both ions and electrons. The object of our work is the development of a numerical method, for this purpose. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method, for the calculation of electron current to a positive bare tether moving at orbital velocity in the ionosphere, i. e. in a flowing magnetized plasma under Maxwellian collisionless conditions. In a PIC code, a number of particles are distributed in phase space and the computational domain has a grid on which Poisson equation is solved for field quantities. The code uses the quasi-neutrality condition to solve for the local potential at points in the plasma which coincide with the computational outside boundary.

We show that this slow differential equation is still of Lindblad-Kossakowski type, that the decoherence terms and the measured output depend explicitly on the amplitudes of quasi-resonant applied field, i. e., the control. Beside a rigorous proof of the slow/fast (adiabatic) reduction based on singular perturbation theory, we also provide a physical interpretation of the result in the context of coherence population trapping via dark states and decoherence-free subspaces.

40|$|We {{show that}} weakly bound He-containing van der Waals {{molecules}} {{can be produced}} and magnetically trapped in buffer-gas cooling experiments, and provide a general model for the formation and dynamics of these molecules. Our analysis shows that, at typical experimental parameters, thermodynamics favors the formation of van der Waals complexes composed of a helium atom bound to most open-shell atoms and molecules, and that complex formation occurs quickly enough to ensure chemical equilibrium. For molecular pairs composed of a He atom and an S-state atom, the molecular spin is stable during formation, dissociation, and collisions, and thus these molecules can be magnetically trapped. Collisional spin relaxations are too slow to affect trap lifetimes. However, helium- 3 -containing complexes can change spin due to <b>adiabatic</b> crossings between <b>trapped</b> and untrapped Zeeman states, mediated by the anisotropic hyperfine interaction, causing trap loss.
