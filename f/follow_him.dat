5|$|Mr. Ramanujan's {{methods were}} so terse and novel and his {{presentation}} so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary , unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly <b>follow</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{forced me}} to put {{the body in the}} boot of the car. He {{forced me to}} <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> as I {{thought we were going to}} a hospital. Then he asked me to go away.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{is still}} {{struggling}} with his marriage to Angie, who had thrown him out of their family home. Later in this episode, the pair reconcile, but only if Tracy allows for Angie to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> {{to make sure that}} he isn't having an affair.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is Amory de Catinat, the heretic and Huguenot," [...] {{cried the}} monk. [...] "I have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> up the St. Lawrence, and I have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> up the Richelieu, and I would have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to the world's end if I could but {{bring him back}} with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|We all <b>followed</b> <b>him.</b> We {{snatched}} our hats {{from the}} hat-stand and our sticks from the umbrella-stand; {{and why we}} <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> we did not and do not know. But we always <b>followed</b> <b>him,</b> whatever was {{the meaning of the}} fact, whatever was the nature of his mastery. And the strange thing was that we <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> the more completely the more nonsensical appeared the thing which he said. At bottom, I believe, if he had risen from our breakfast table and said: [...] "I am going to find the Holy Pig with Ten Tails," [...] we should have <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> {{to the end of the}} world.|$|R
5|$|Arya Stark {{continues}} to train blind with The Waif, but still performs poorly in her duels. After one particular defeat, Arya is surprised when Jaqen H'ghar who {{she has not}} encountered for a while, appears and attempts to tempt her with food, bedding, {{and the return of}} her vision.

5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who {{disagree}} with him are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who <b>follow</b> <b>him,</b> have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be reckless before the first battle.|$|E
5|$|John Jervis {{was born}} in Meaford, Staffordshire, on 9 January 1735, the second son of Swynfen and Elizabeth Jervis.

The young Jervis was educated at Burton-upon-Trent Grammar School and subsequently at Reverend Swinden's Academy in Greenwich, London.|$|E

5|$|Von Lettow-Vorbeck did {{not stay}} at Ngomano for long and soon marched his force south to attack more Portuguese positions, leaving only one company at Ngomano as a rearguard {{in case the}} British decided to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> into Portuguese East Africa. His force won several more {{victories}} while seizing even more supplies and ammunition before moving back into German East Africa in 1918.|$|E

Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, Gaston has her thrown into the basement with her father and rallies the villagers to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> to the castle to kill the Beast ("The Mob Song"). With Chip's aid, Maurice and Belle escape and rush back to the castle.|$|E
5|$|Early on 23 February Willaumez sailed again, {{taking his}} fleet southwards towards the Pertuis d'Antioche near Rochefort after sending the {{schooner}} Magpye into Lorient with orders for Troude to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> to the rendezvous. Troude {{found that the}} tide was too low to sail at once, and so sent a squadron of three frigates ahead, {{under the command of}} Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien. These frigates were the 40-gun Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle, which sailed together on the evening of 23 February southwards in the direction of Belle Île. Their departure had been observed by Beresford's force, which remained off Lorient to watch Troude but sent the 38-gun frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and 18-gun brig-sloop HMS Doterel under Commander Anthony Abdy in pursuit.|$|E

5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct. She tells him that the black flowers have returned and will melt the polar icecaps, destroying mankind so that life can continue. Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh from the next step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl {{was born}} in Germany on 22 August 1902. Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl, owned a {{successful}} heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> into the business world. Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her {{to carry on the}} family name and secure the family fortune. However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business. Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the Eastern Front in Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to <b>follow</b> <b>him.</b> He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E

After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> as he goes into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not <b>follow</b> <b>him</b> as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees {{at the annual meeting of}} the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|In a new {{affidavit}} (his second affidavit {{and third}} statement), Conley admitted he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank.

Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E
