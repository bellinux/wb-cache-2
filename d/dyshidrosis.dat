40|$|The {{features}} or {{mechanisms of}} <b>dyshidrosis</b> {{have not been}} sufficiently clarified. Neither has the difference between hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis. To clarify the features and mechanisms of <b>dyshidrosis</b> (hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis) in syringomyelia, the clinical features focusing on hidrosis of 30 patients with syringomyelia and Chiari malformation located from a syringomyelia database were prospectively analysed. The patients were classified into three groups: eight patients (26. 7 %) had segmental hypohidrosis, 10 (33. 3 %) had segmental hyperhidrosis, and 12 (40. 0 %) had normohidrosis. We found that the Karnofsky functional status for the hyperhydrosis and normohidrosis groups {{were significantly higher than}} for the hypohidrosis group (p= 0. 0012), with {{no significant differences between the}} hyperhidrosis and normohidrosis groups. The duration from the onset of syringomyelia to the current <b>dyshidrosis</b> was significantly longer in the hypohidrosis group than in the hyperhidrosis group (p= 0. 0027). A significant correlation was identified between the duration from the onset of syringomyelia to the time at study and the performance score (r=− 0. 599, p= 0. 0003). The results substantiate previous hypotheses that in its early stage syringomyelia causes segmental hyperactivity of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and hyperactivity of these gradually subsides as tissue damage progresses. Focal hyperhidrosis may be regarded as a hallmark of a relatively intact spinal cord, as well as normohidrosis. ...|$|E

40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{resulting from the}} deficiency or absence of the enzyme alpha galactosidase A; this defect leads to the systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and its metabolites. Organic involvement in men is well known, but in women it is controversial, mainly due to the random X-chromosome inactivation in each of their cells (Lyon hypothesis). This would explain why women (heterozygotes) present a wide variability in the severity of their phenotype. The manifestations are multisystemic and begin in early childhood, reaching a severe compromise in adulthood. Typical acroparesthesia in hands and feet, gastrointestinal symptoms, angiokeratomas, <b>dyshidrosis,</b> hearing loss, arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, and renal failure can be observed.

At the end of the trial, 144 subjects presented apparently unaffected skin. Re-epithelialization occurred in 2 of the subjects with ulcers, the remaining subjects showed a marked im-provement in the symptoms and signs under observation.

40|$|Context: Pompholyx (called <b>dyshidrosis</b> by some) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{conditions}} and its immune response is presently poorly understood. Case report: We describe a 58 year old African American female with a clinical history of rheumatoid arthritis and type II diabetes who presented a chronic five-year, itchy vesicular/blistering rash involving her hands and feet. A lesional skin biopsy was taken for hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) analysis. In addition, a multicolor direct immunofluorescence (MDIF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies were performed. The major findings to be reported were: the H & E examination revealed spongiotic dermatitis and pompholix. IHC and MDIF studies demonstrated focally deposits of positive CD 45, CD 3, CD 8, anti myeloperoxidase (MPO), and anti-human IgE, C 3 C, C 3 D and anti-human-fibrinogen within the epidermal spongiotic process, as well as around the blood vessels surrounding the inflammatory process especially at the sweat glands and respective ductus. The patient began mycophenolate mofetil therapy, with successful clearing of the palms and soles. Conclusion: The significance of our findings indicates a complex immunological process including complement, MPO and T-cell immune response. In addition, possibly a secondary allergic process for the presence of IgE immune response and possibly aggravation by application of other medicines.

40|$|Background Keratolysis exfoliativa (KE), {{also known}} as <b>dyshidrosis</b> lamellosa sicca, is a palmoplantar {{dermatosis}} characterized by air-filled blisters and collarette desquamation. It has been regarded as a subtype of dyshidrotic eczema, a fungal infection or a dermatophytid reaction. KE may also resemble acral peeling skin syndrome and localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Although KE is a common disorder, it is a rarely reported and is an under-recognized dermatosis. Objectives To delineate the characteristic features of KE. Methods We investigated the clinical, immunohistopathological, ultrastructural and molecular features of KE. Patients were included from the clinical records. Additional diagnostic research consisted of mutation analysis of the candidate genes TGM 5, KRT 5, KRT 14, FLG, SPINK 6 and SPINK 9. Results A total of 24 patients with KE were identified, six with familial and 18 with sporadic KE. Lesions consisted of air-filled blisters only on palmoplantar skin, followed by collarette and lamellar peeling. Both light microscopy and electron microscopy showed cleavage and partially degraded corneodesmosomes within the stratum corneum, whereas immunofluorescence microscopy showed normal expression of corneodesmosomal components. No mutations were found in TGM 5, KRT 5 / 14 and SPINK 6 / 9. There was no clear link with atopy or with FLG mutations. Conclusions Our study suggests premature corneodesmolysis as the main pathological mechanism of this palmoplantar skin disorder. We conclude that KE {{appears to be a}} distinct peeling entity...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Dyshidrosis</b> lamellosa sicca (DLS) is a {{dermatological}} disorder {{affecting the}} palms and less frequently the soles. It {{is characterized by}} blisters filled with air and superficial lamellar peeling. So far, only clinical characteristics of DLS have been described and no {{studies have been done}} on the histopathological, ultrastructural or genetic level. Materials and Methods: Five DLS, one epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) and three acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS) patients visited our policlinic. Two DLS patients and two EBS patients replied to our questionnaire. A standardized questionnaire and intake was performed including physical examination and additional diagnostic tests in the patients who visited our policlinic. Results: The onset of symptoms in DLS is between early childhood and adulthood. Familial occurrence is possible. DLS is characterized by blisters filled with air followed by superficial lamellar peeling on the palms and less frequently on the soles. A burning sensation and pain are often present. Aggravating factors are friction and warm temperatures. Six DLS patients have hyperhidrosis plantaris and four of them also have hyperhidrosis palmaris. Two DLS patients are atopic and only one DLS patient has mycosis of the feet. Histopathologically, the level of splicing is localized in the higher part of the stratum corneum. Furthermore, ultrastructural examination showed ruptures and fragments of corneodesmosomes. Conclusions: DLS is an entity on its own and can be distinguished clinically, histopathologically, ultrastructurally and genetically from other clinically similar dermatoses, especially from APSS and EBS. In addition, DLS could be caused by a dysfunction in the corneodesmosome. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium spp. are diphtheroid {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} pitted keratolysis, a common plantar infection {{confined to the}} thick stratum corneum. AIM: To study a series of demographic features of patients suffering from pitted keratolysis, and to present {{a review of the}} Corynebacterium-associated infections, including pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2 -year, two-center, prospective survey assessed the demographics of pitted keratolysis, including age, gender, site of infection, symptoms, patients' complaints, the use of protective and/or occlusive shoes, seasonality of diagnosis, drug intake, associated skin signs (including <b>dyshidrosis,</b> erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis), recurrences, and previous diagnoses and treatments. RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients with pitted keratolysis was 24. 9 years (range, 10 - 57 years). The male to female ratio was 7. 8 : 1. The soles of both feet were commonly involved (92. 4 %). Pressure-bearing areas were the usual sites of infection, ranging from restricted involvement of the toes (12 / 53, 22. 6 %) to spreading to the entire plantar surface (15 / 53, 28. 3 %). A total of 36 (68 %) of the 53 patients complained of hyperhidrosis. An unpleasant smell and pain were noted by 35 (66 %) and 25 (47 %) of the 53 patients, respectively. Occlusive and protective shoes were worn in 51 (96. 2 %) and 31 (58. 4 %) of the 53 cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pitted keratolysis commonly affects young male patients wearing protective shoes for professional reasons, inducing a moist and warm environment.

40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{research}} areas determining the pathogenesis and correction of critical conditions in obstetric care in the past 15 years {{on the basis of}} the dissertations made at the V. A. Negovsky Research Institute of General Reanimatology. Subjects and methods. Nine hundred and twenty-nine pregnant women, parturients, and puerperas were examined; the latter were allocated to comparison groups in terms of age, weight, comorbidity, performed intensive therapy and underwent both retrospective and prospective analysis from 1981 to 2010. The comparison group comprised 44 nonobstetric patients while examining multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) in the purperas. The latter with massive blood loss were separately identified when evaluating the impaired oxygen status in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and MOD. According to the pathology and indicators under study, the puerperas with MOD were examined in a few steps (2 to 7). Water sectoral disorders were detected in three steps: on days 1, 3, and 5; these were identified in four steps in case of eclamptic coma (EC), regional anesthesia, and impaired oxygen status. Results. The findings are suggestive of significant impairments in central hemodynamics (CHD) in the severe forms of gestosis, which are caused by reductions in cardiac index and circulating blood volume, the basis for these is hypovolemia. <b>Dyshidrosis</b> appears as an increased extracellular sector mainly due to interstitial hyperhydration. The low values of arterial blood oxygen, its delivery and uptake, oxygen extract coefficient and the high value of oxygen debt (OD) confirmed blood shunting or circulatory centralization, which  was indicative of visceral hypoxia. Determination of the level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in puerperas with coma showed its diminution due to reduced blood flow in the cortical structures. Regional anesthesia in complicated pregnancy and delivery stabilized CHD, dropped the level of proteinuria, and failed to have a negative impact on the fetus and to cause extragenital manifestations. Conclusion. The proposed algorithms for treating critical conditions in obstetric care contributed to the normalization of CHD parameters, the recovery of water sectoral balance and immune status, resulted in lower mortality rates in MOD, and could increase CBF and minimize OD, reducing the duration of comatous state in EC and the length of stay in intensive care units.   </div...|$|E
