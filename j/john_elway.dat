On September 16, 2007, Favre and the Packers defeated the New York Giants to give Favre his record setting 149th win, passing <b>John</b> <b>Elway.</b> On September 30, Favre threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings in a game against the Vikings. This was his 421st NFL touchdown pass, and set a new all-time record, surpassing Dan Marino's 420.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the most}} highly sought-after free agents, Manning {{selected}} the Denver Broncos after meeting with <b>John</b> <b>Elway,</b> a retired Broncos Hall-of-Famer quarterback who was now the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager, and Broncos head coach John Fox.

5|$|The Giants {{played the}} Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI {{in front of}} 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl. After the Broncos' Rich Karlis kicked a 48-yard field goal on the game's opening drive, the Giants took the lead with a 78-yard {{touchdown}} scoring drive, led by quarterback Phil Simms's 6-for-6 passing.

Although the two teams quarterbacks combined to complete all 13 passes attempted in the second quarter, the only score came when Giants' defensive end George Martin sacked Elway in the endzone for a safety to make the score 10–9.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted <b>John</b> <b>Elway</b> when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
