40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a comparison between the characteristics of two public Web spaces: the pages under the. <b>KR</b> (<b>South</b> <b>Korea)</b> domain, and the pages under the. CL (Chile) domain. We show several similarities that contribute to validate more general models for the characteristics of the Web, specially in terms of link structure. The key findings are: • We downloaded 4. 7 million pages from the. kr (Korea) domain and 3. 2 million pages from the. cl (Chile) domain. • Domains in Korea host on average 6 Web sites each, while in Chile, a domain has on average only 1. 1 Web sites. • Korean Web sites have almost 4 times as many pages as Chilean Web sites. • Chilean Web pages are about 50 % larger than Korean pages. • The most used technology in Korea for dynamic pages is ASP, and in Chile, PHP. • There is a strong preference of Microsoft formats for audio and video in the Korean Web. • The distribution of links in terms of in-degree and out-degree for both collections are nearly the same...|$|E
