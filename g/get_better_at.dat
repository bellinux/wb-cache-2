5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid in word learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E

500|$|The Ninja Gaiden games {{gained a}} {{reputation}} throughout the gaming community for their difficulty and attention to detail. Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmo’s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "it’s impossible to believe they couldn’t {{have found a way}} to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown for an entire year until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, and maybe the best ninja game of all time."

2500|$|While at Stanford, Thiel {{encountered}} René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him. Mimetic theory {{posits that}} human behavior {{is based upon}} mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: [...] "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that {{we have all the}} amazing achievements of the modern world," [...] but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: [...] "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another." [...] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: [...] "The big problem with competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world." ...|$|E

Radcliffe {{then went to the}} Junior track World championships and finished fourth in the 3,000metres. In her first senior race, in Durham at the start of 1993, Radcliffe finished second to Olympic Champion Derartu Tulu. At the age of 19 Radcliffe finished in seventh place at the 1993 World Championships. Radcliffe claimed back to back World Cross Challenge wins at Durham and Mallusk to start the 1994 season. Radcliffe missed the World Cross Country Championships with a foot injury. Radcliffe was initially misdiagnosed with the injury which forced her to miss all of 1994 and thought about quitting as the injury would not <b>get</b> <b>better.</b> <b>At</b> the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games in Hengelo in 1995 Radcliffe outkicked Tulu to run the third fastest time by a British woman for the 5,000metres.

The Olympic Games saw Radcliffe finished fifth in the 5,000 metres. Radcliffe rounded off 1996 by finishing third in a cross country race in Durham.|$|E

6000|$|My dear Taylor--This morning I {{received}} yours of the 2d, {{and with}} it a letter from Hessey enclosing a Bank post Bill of £30, an ample sum I assure you--more I had no thought of.--You should not have delayed so long in Fleet St.--leading an inactive life as you did was breathing poison: {{you will find the}} country air do more for you than you expect. But it must be proper country air. You must choose a spot. What sort of a place is Retford? You should have a dry, gravelly, barren, elevated country, open to the currents of air, and such a place is generally furnished with the finest springs--The neighbourhood of a rich enclosed fulsome manured arable land, especially in a valley and almost as bad on a flat, would be almost as bad as the smoke of Fleet St.--Such a place as this was Shanklin, only open to the south-east, and surrounded by hills in every other direction. From this south-east came the damps of the sea; which, having no egress, the air would for days together take on an unhealthy idiosyncrasy altogether enervating and weakening as a city smoke--I felt it very much. Since I have been here at Winchester I have been improving in health--it is not so confined--and there is {{on one side of the}} City a dry chalky down, where the air is worth Sixpence a pint. So if you do not <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> Retford, do not impute it to your own weakness before you have well considered the Nature of the air and soil--especially as Autumn is encroaching--for the Autumn fog over a rich land is like the steam from cabbage water. What makes the great difference between valesmen, flatlandmen and mountaineers? The cultivation of the earth in a great measure--Our health temperament and disposition are taken more (notwithstanding the contradiction of the history of Cain and Abel) from the air we breathe, than is generally imagined. See the difference between a Peasant and a Butcher.--I am convinced a great cause of it is the difference of the air they breathe: the one takes his mingled with the fume of slaughter, the other from the dank exhalement from the glebe; the teeming damp that comes up from the plough-furrow is of great effect in taming the fierceness of a strong man--more than his labour--Let him be mowing furze upon a mountain, and at the day's end his thoughts will run upon a..axe[104] if he ever had handled one; let him leave the plough, and he will think quietly of his supper. Agriculture is the tamer of men--the steam from the earth is like drinking their Mother's milk--it enervates their nature--this appears a great cause of the imbecility of the Chinese: and if this sort of atmosphere is a mitigation to the energy of a strong man, how much more must it injure a weak one unoccupied unexercised--For what is the cause of so many men maintaining a good state in Cities, but occupation--An idle man, a man who is not sensitively alive to self-interest in a city cannot continue long in good health. This is easily explained--If you were to walk leisurely through an unwholesome path in the fens, with a little horror of them, you would be sure to have your ague. But let Macbeth cross the same path, with the dagger in the air leading him on, and he would never have an ague or anything like it--You should give these things a serious consideration. Notts, I believe, is a flat county--You should be on the slope of one of the dry barren hills in Somersetshire. I am convinced there is as harmful air to be breathed in the country as in town. I am greatly obliged to you for your letter. Perhaps, if you had had strength and spirits enough, you would have felt offended by my offering a note of hand, or rather expressed it. However, I am sure you will give me credit for not in anywise mistrusting you: or imagining that you would take advantage of any power I might give you over me. No--It proceeded from my serious resolve not to be a gratuitous borrower, from a great desire to be correct in money matters, to have in my desk the Chronicles of them to refer to, and know my worldly non-estate: besides in case of my death such documents would be but just, if merely as memorials of the friendly turns I had done to me--Had I known of your illness I should not have written in such fiery phrase in my first letter. I hope that shortly you will be able to bear six times as much. Brown likes the tragedy very much: But he is not a fit judge of it, as I have only acted as midwife to his plot; and of course he will be fond of his child. I do not think I can make you any extracts without spoiling the effect of the whole when you come to read it--I hope you will then not think my labour mis-spent. Since I finished it, I have finished Lamia, and am now occupied in revising St. Agnes's Eve, and studying Italian. Ariosto I find as diffuse, in parts, as Spenser--I understand completely the difference between them. I will cross the letter with some lines from Lamia. Brown's kindest remembrances to you--and I am ever your most sincere friend ...|$|E
