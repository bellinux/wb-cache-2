25|$|Diathermy {{is used by}} some as {{a synonym}} for <b>electrosurgery</b> but in other {{contexts}} diathermy means dielectric heating, produced by rotation of molecular dipoles in a high frequency electromagnetic field.

Lower frequencies, allowing for deeper penetration, are used in industrial processes.|$|E
25|$|None {{of these}} systems are perfect. For example, they are {{unreliable}} at extremes of age (e.g. neonates, infants or the very elderly). Secondly, certain agents, such as nitrous oxide, may produce anesthesia without reducing {{the value of the}} depth monitor. This is because the molecular action of these agents (NMDA receptor antagonists) differs from that of more conventional agents, and they suppress cortical EEG activity less. Thirdly, they are prone to interference from other biological potentials (such as EMG), or external electrical signals (such as <b>electrosurgery).</b> This means that the technology that will reliably monitor depth of anesthesia for every patient and every anesthetic does not yet exist.|$|E
500|$|Cryosurgery {{procedures}} such as cryoablation use liquid argon {{to destroy}} tissue {{such as cancer}} cells. It is used in a procedure called [...] "argon-enhanced coagulation", a form of argon plasma beam <b>electrosurgery.</b> The procedure carries a risk of producing gas embolism and {{has resulted in the}} death of at least one patient.|$|E
2500|$|RF <b>Electrosurgery</b> is {{performed}} using a RF electrosurgical generator (also referred to as an electrosurgical unit or ESU) and a handpiece including one or two electrodes - a monopolar or bipolar instrument. All RF <b>electrosurgery</b> is bipolar so [...] the difference between monopolar and bipolar instruments is that monopolar instruments comprise only one electrode while bipolar instruments include both electrodes in their design.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrosurgery</b> is the {{application}} of a high-frequency (radio frequency) alternating polarity, electrical current to biological tissue as a means to cut, coagulate, desiccate, or fulgurate tissue. (These terms are used in specific ways for this methodology—see below). Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. [...] Electrosurgical devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Relatively low-powered high {{frequency}} <b>electrosurgery</b> {{can be performed}} on conscious outpatients with no grounded machines without a dispersive electrode [...] Operating at low currents with no dispersive electrode is possible because, at the medium RF frequencies (usually 100 – 500kHz) that the machines generate, the self-capacitance of the patient's body (which is between the patient's body and the machine's ground) {{is large enough to}} allow the resulting displacement current to act as a virtual [...] "circuit completion path." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{electrosurgical}} procedures, {{the tissue}} is heated by an electric current. [...] Although electrical devices {{that create a}} heated probe {{may be used for}} the cauterization of tissue in some applications, <b>electrosurgery</b> is usually used to refer to a quite different method than electrocautery. Electrocautery uses heat conduction from a probe heated to a glowing temperature by a direct current (much {{in the manner of a}} soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrosurgery,</b> by contrast, uses radio {{frequency}} (RF) alternating current {{to heat the}} tissue by RF induced intracellular oscillation of ionized molecules that result in an elevation of intracellular temperature. [...] When the intracellular temperature reaches 60 degrees C, instantaneous cell death occurs. If tissue is heated to 60-99 degrees C, the simultaneous processes of tissue desiccation (dehydration) and protein coagulation occur. If the intracellular temperature rapidly reaches 100 degrees C, the intracellular contents undergo a liquid to gas conversion, massive volumetric expansion, and resulting explosive vaporization.|$|E
2500|$|Coblation tonsillectomy: This {{surgical}} procedure {{is performed using}} plasma to remove the tonsils. Coblation technology combines radiofrequency energy and saline to create a plasma field. The plasma field is able to dissociate molecular bonds of target tissue while remaining relatively cool (40-70°C), which results in minimal or no damage to surrounding healthy tissue. A Coblation tonsillectomy is carried out in an operating room setting, with the patient under general anesthesia. Tonsillectomies are generally performed for two main reasons: tonsillar hypertrophy (enlarged tonsils) and recurrent tonsillitis. It has been claimed that this technique results in less pain, faster healing, and less post operative care. [...] However, review of 21 studies gives conflicting results about levels of pain, and its comparative safety {{has yet to be}} confirmed. This technique has been criticized for a higher than expected rate of bleeding presumably due to the low temperature which may be insufficient to seal the divided blood vessels but several papers offer conflicting (some positive, some negative) results. More recent studies of coblation tonsillectomy indicate reduced pain and ostalgia; less intraoperative or postoperative complications; lesser incidence of delayed hemorrhage, more significantly in pediatric populations, less postoperative pain and early return to daily activities, fewer secondary infections of the tonsil bed and significantly lower rates of secondary hemorrhage. Unlike the <b>electrosurgery</b> procedure, Coblation Tonsillectomy generates significantly lower temperatures on contacted tissue. [...] Long term studies seem to show that surgeons experienced with the technique have very few complications.|$|E

50|$|Both {{cryosurgery}} and <b>electrosurgery</b> {{are effective}} choices for small areas of actinic cheilitis. Cryosurgery {{is accomplished by}} applying liquid nitrogen in an open spraying technique. Local anesthesia is not required, but treatment of the entire lip can be quite painful. Cure rates in excess of 96% have been reported. Cryosurgery is the treatment of choice for focal areas of actinic cheilitis. <b>Electrosurgery</b> is an alternate treatment, but local anesthesia is required, making it less practical than cryosurgery. With both techniques, adjacent tissue damage can delay healing and promote scar formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of a}} laser can {{decrease}} morbidity after surgery, {{and reduces}} the need for anesthetics. Because of the cauterization of tissue there will be little bleeding following soft tissue procedures, and some risks of alternative <b>electrosurgery</b> procedures are avoided.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{options include}} 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, scalpel vermillionectomy, {{chemical}} peel, <b>electrosurgery,</b> {{and carbon dioxide}} laser vaporization.

5000|$|Some sources {{insist that}} <b>electrosurgery</b> {{be applied to}} surgery {{accomplished}} by high-frequency alternating current (AC) cutting, and that [...] "electrocautery" [...] be used only {{for the practice of}} cauterization with heated nichrome wires powered by direct current (DC), as in the handheld battery-operated portable cautery tools.|$|E
5000|$|There is evidence, {{although}} {{the evidence is}} somewhat controversial, of the dangers from toxicity or possible infectivity of surgical smoke produced by <b>electrosurgery</b> or ultrasonic scalpel procedures; such surgical smoke contains carcinogenic or irritant chemicals and/or bio-aerosols capable of harming patients or operating room personnel upon inhalation.|$|E

50|$|Bipolar, {{where both}} {{electrodes}} are mounted on same pen-like device and electric current passes {{only through the}} tissue being treated. Advantage of bipolar <b>electrosurgery</b> is that it prevents the flow of current through other tissues {{of the body and}} focuses only on the tissue in contact. This is useful in microsurgery and in patients with cardiac pacemaker.|$|E
50|$|SWR {{can also}} have a {{detrimental}} impact upon the performance of microwave based medical applications. In microwave <b>electrosurgery</b> an antenna that is placed directly into tissue may not always have an optimal match with the feedline resulting in an SWR. The presence of SWR can affect monitoring components used to measure power levels impacting the reliability of such measurements.|$|E

50|$|In {{the latter}} mode, the patient must sit or lie on an {{insulated}} table, {{much as in}} the case with objects to be charged electrostatically with high-voltage D.C. (as from a Van de Graaff generator, for example). Stray ground paths between the patient and foreign conductors (such as a metal table leading somewhere to earth-ground) can offer another capacitative reservoir besides the patient, and burns out of the area of treatment may thus result, from current passing between patient and the earth-ground. For this reason, hyfrecation and all non-ground-pad <b>electrosurgery</b> is performed only on conscious patients, who would be aware of the burn and discomfort from an unwanted earth-ground path. (In types of <b>electrosurgery</b> which do employ a ground-pad, the ground-pad path serves as such a low resistance ground to the machine, that extraneous other ground paths become unimportant, and thus with proper precautions these methods can, and often are, used on anesthetized patients).|$|E
5000|$|A hyfrecator is a low-powered medical {{apparatus}} used in <b>electrosurgery</b> on conscious patients, {{usually in}} an office setting. It is used to destroy tissue directly, and to stop bleeding during minor surgery. It works by emitting low-power high-frequency high-voltage AC electrical pulses, via an electrode mounted on a handpiece, directly to the affected area of the body. A continuous electrical spark discharge may be drawn between probe and tissue, especially at the highest settings of power, although this is not necessary for the device to function. The amount of output power is adjustable, and {{the device is equipped}} with different tips, electrodes and forceps, depending on the electrosurgical requirement. Unlike other types of <b>electrosurgery,</b> the hyfrecator does not employ a dispersive electrode pad that is attached to the patient in an area not being treated, and that leads back to the apparatus (sometimes loosely but not quite correctly called a [...] "ground pad"). It is designed to work with non-grounded (insulated) patients.|$|E
