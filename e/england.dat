5|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, {{the basic}} {{political}} system in <b>England</b> is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. There {{has not been a}} government of <b>England</b> since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union, joined <b>England</b> and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union <b>England</b> was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of <b>England.</b> Today <b>England</b> is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in <b>England,</b> out of the 650 total.|$|E

5|$|Before the Test series began, the West Indian cricket team played three One Day Internationals against <b>England</b> in May 1988.

In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by <b>England,</b> the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with <b>England</b> {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia tried {{to get a hold of}} Tortola, but <b>England</b> denied them settlement. Likewise, <b>England</b> declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E
