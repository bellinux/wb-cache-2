40|$|A one {{dimensional}} {{model of the}} magnetic multipole volume plasma source has been developed for application to intense ion/neutral atom beam injectors. The model uses plasma transport coefficients for particle and energy flow to create {{a detailed description of}} the plasma parameters along an axis parallel to that of the extracted beam. In this paper the isotopic modelling of positive hydrogenic ions is considered and compared with experimental data from the neutral beam injectors of the Joint European Torus. The use of the code to gain insights into the processes contributing to the ratios of the ionic species is demonstrated and the conclusion is drawn that 75 % of the atomic ion species arises from ionization of dissociated molecules and 25 % from dissociation of the molecular ions. However whilst the former process is independent of the <b>filter</b> <b>field,</b> the latter is sensitive to the change in distribution of fast and thermal electrons produced by the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>field</b> and an optimum combination of field strength and depth exists.

40|$|For Neutral Beam Injection at JET an {{ion source}} is {{required}} {{with a high}} monatomic species yield. It {{is now clear that}} the magnetic <b>filter</b> <b>field</b> arrangement used to enhance the monatomic species yield also produces non-uniformity in the ion source plasma density. This property was known from Langmuir probe array measurements taken during development of the ion source. Further experimental evidence is derived from the analysis of detailed spectroscopic and calonmetnc measurements of extracted beams on the Neutral Beam Test Bed Nonumformity of the ion source density results in reduced transmission of the extracted beam, with greater interception on beamline scraper elements. The maximum power injected to the JET plasma from the Octant 4 Neutral Beam Injector is often limited by excessive beam interception on beamline scraper elements and not by the limits of the electrical power supplies. A development programme was initiated to develop an ion source configuration to produce improved uniformity, without degrading the monatomic species yield. This was approached in two ways - 1 Development of a Monte-Carlo model of the ion source. 2 An expenmental programme of source modification on the Neutral Beam Test Bed.

40|$|Abstract. Large {{vortices}} {{occurring in}} the axial plane of a self-similar axisymmetric turbulent jet are educed by spatially filtering PIV data. First, the instantaneous PIV frame is convolved with a Gaussian kernel to obtain a smooth (low-pass) field. Next, the low-pass field is Galilean transformed to expose the large vortices residing near {{the edges of the}} jet. Large vortices tend to organize them-selves in preferred modes; evidence of ring and helical modes is revealed by Galilean transformation of the low-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>field.</b> Both modes seem to occur prominently in jets, with the helical mode being the more frequent. The overall diameter of both ring and helical modes is comparable with the local jet width. The low-pass field occasionally exhibits arrowhead shaped structures with large entrainment at their downstream tips. Stochastic estimates computed from the Galilean-transformed low-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>field</b> indicate that jet meander and a sweep-in of ambient fluid are sufficient to reconstruct large vortices.
