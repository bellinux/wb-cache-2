Smicridea McLachlan (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) is {{the only}} genus of the Smicrideinae present in the Neotropical Region. Only two of the 90 species of Trichoptera recorded from Uruguay, belong to the genus Smicridea: Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) atrobasis Flint and Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) dentifera Flint. In this paper, seven species of the subgenus Smicridea (Rhyacophylax) Müller were identified from Uruguay: Smicridea (R.) coronata Flint, Smicridea (R.) discalis Flint, Smicridea (R.) mesembrina (Navás), Smicridea (R.) pampeana Flint, and Smicridea (R.) spinulosa Flint, recorded {{for the first time}} from this country; <b>S.</b> (<b>R.)</b> atrobasis; and <b>S.</b> (<b>R.)</b> dentifera, whose distribution is extended to the Paysandú and Salto Departments.

40|$|Root zone storage {{capacity}} (<b>S</b> <b>r)</b> {{is an important}} variable for hydrology and climate studies, as it strongly inﬂuences the hydrological functioning of a catchment and, via evaporation, the local climate.

This study tests the hypothesis that vegetation adapts its <b>S</b> <b>r</b> to create a buffer large enough to sustain the plant during drought conditions of a certain critical strength (with a certain probability of exceedance). Following this method, <b>S</b> <b>r</b> can be estimated from precipitation and evaporative demand data.

Using a model experiment, we show that the climate-derived <b>S</b> <b>r</b> can better reproduce hydrological regime signatures for humid catchments; for more arid catchments, the soil and climate methods perform similarly.

Ht of the bloods drawn secondly from, the normal carps decreased more than that of the bloods drawn firstly, E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> of the former decreased more than that of the latter. 3. By the injection of heavy metal salts 0. 1 ～ 0. 2 cc. of 0. 5 ～ 1. 0 ppm. solution into carp muscle immediately after the first blood drawing, Ht and E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> of the second blood drawing (after one or two days of no feeding) varied significantly. Namely, by the injection of mercuric chloride (0. 2 cc. of 1 ppm) Ht increased remarkably, but E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> decreased (after one day); by that of 0. 5 ppm solution Ht increased or varied at all and E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> varied but little (after one day); by that of cupric chloride (0. 2 cc. of 1. 0 ppm.)

Ht increased significantly but E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> decreased; by that of cupric sulphate (0. 1 cc. of 1. 0 ppm.) Ht and E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> varied little (after two days). 4. When carps were reared in the solution of heavy metal salts of 0. 1 ～ 0. 5 ppm. for two or four days of no feeding, in case of mercuric chloride (0. 5 ppm. for two days) Ht increased a little in average but E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> varied at all; in case of cupric sulphate (0. 5 ppm. for two days) the former increased a little but the latter decreased a little in average; in case of lead chloride (0. 1 ppm. for four days) the former increased a little but the latter varied little in average. 5. It was presumed from these results that by the in jection or treatment of the solution of heavy metal salts, the loss of blood water, the decrease of erythrocytes count caused by check of blood production and the decrease of oxygen consumption were brought about. 魚類血液の量的変化から魚体の生理的・環境的異常を判定する方法として,前報 12) と全様に,第 1 回採血時と第 2 回採血時のHt:E. <b>S.</b> <b>R.</b> の変化を対照と比較して,重金属塩類の魚類血液えの影響を比較した. 材料は全て 130 g以上 200 g位までの満 1 年の養殖ゴイである. 1. 体重の 1 / 200 から 1 / 1200 (C.
