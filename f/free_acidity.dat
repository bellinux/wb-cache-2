25|$|There {{are various}} {{extremely}} important electrochemical processes in both nature and industry, like the coating of objects with metals or metal oxides through electrodeposition and {{the detection of}} alcohol in drunken drivers through the redox reaction of ethanol. The generation of chemical energy through photosynthesis is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle lead acid batteries) {{there is also a}} wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial. Electrochemistry has also important applications in the food industry, like the assessment of food/package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the determination of <b>free</b> <b>acidity</b> in olive oil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Free</b> <b>acidity</b> is an {{important}} parameter that defines the quality of olive oil and {{is defined as a}} percentage as grams of free fatty acids (expressed as oleic acid, the main fatty acid present in olive oil) in 100 grams of oil. As defined by the European Commission regulation No. 2568/91 and subsequent amendments, the highest quality olive oil (Extra-Virgin olive oil) must feature a <b>free</b> <b>acidity</b> lower than 0.8%. Virgin olive oil is characterized by acidity between 0.8% and 2%, while lampante olive oil (a low quality oil that is not edible) features a <b>free</b> <b>acidity</b> higher than 2%. The increase of <b>free</b> <b>acidity</b> in olive oil is due to free fatty acids that are released from triglycerides.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Research {{work was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the physicochemical analysis of olive oil extracted from olives grown in Khyber pakhtunkhwa. The samples were studied for physicochemical characteristics (Specific gravity, refractive index, Acid value, Saponification value and Peroxide value). The <b>free</b> fatty <b>acidity</b> is thus a direct measure {{of the quality of}} the oil. Olive oil was analysed for fatty acids commonly present in olive oils which are Palmitic, Palmitoleic, Stearic, Oleic, Linoleic, Linolenic, Arachidic and Gadoleic which have specific carbon number and their values in percentage are C 16 : 0 (15. 4) ...|$|R

Ten ml of this vitriol water was diluted with plain water to two hundred ml and was given to twenty six patients by stomach tube at 37 ℃. Gastric acidity of the patients was measured at thirty minutes intervals during the following 150 minutes after the administration of the water. In seven cases of normoacidity no significant difference was proved between the effects of the mineral water and of caffeine control (0. 2 g in 200 ml.). In ten cases of hyperacidity a marked decrease in the <b>free</b> gastric <b>acidity</b> curve was recognized by the use of the mineral water compared with caffeine control.

50|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure <b>free</b> <b>acidity</b> {{in olive oil}} (as defined by the European Commission regulation No. 2568/91) is a manual titration procedure: a known volume of the oil to be tested is added to a mix of ether, methanol and phenolphthalein, known volumes of potassium hydroxide KOH 0.1M (the titrant) are added {{until there is a}} change in the color of the solution. The total volume of added titrant is then used to estimate the <b>free</b> <b>acidity.</b> The official technique for acidity measure in olive oil is accurate and reliable, but is essentially a laboratory method that must be carried out by trained personnel (mainly because of the toxic compounds used). Hence it is not suitable for in situ measurements in small oil mills.|$|E

In order to classify extra virgin olive oils, principal component analysis was applied on both fatty acid composition and middle infrared spectra. Spectral data was manipulated with a wavelet function prior to principal component analysis. Results revealed more successful classification of oils according geographical origin and variety using fatty acid composition than spectral data. However, each method has quite good ability to differentiate olive oil samples with respect to harvest year. Middle infrared spectra of all olive oil samples were related with fatty acid profile and <b>free</b> fatty <b>acidity</b> using partial least square analysis. Orthogonal signal correction and wavelet compression were applied before partial least square analysis. Correlation coefficient and relative error of prediction for oleic acid (highest amount fatty acid) were determined as 0. 93 and 1. 38, respectively. Also, partial least square regression resulted in 0. 85 as R 2 value and 0. 085 as standard error of prediction value for <b>free</b> fatty <b>acidity</b> quantification. In adulteration part, spectral data manipulated with principal component and partial least square analysis, to distinguish adulterated and pure olive oil samples, and to quantify level of adulteration, respectively. The detection limit of monovarietal adulteration varied between 5 and 10 % and R 2 value of partial least square was determined as higher than 0. 95. Hazelnut, corn-sunflower binary mixture, cottonseed and rapeseed oils can be detected in olive oil at levels higher than 10 %, 5 %, 5 % and 5 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the antioxidant and anti-ulcer effect of methanolic extract of Cucumis sativum L. seeds. Extraction was done using different solvents of increasing polarity (chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol). The antioxidant activity of all the extracts was measured by DPPH method. The methanolic extract of Cucumis sativum L. (MECS) seeds showed maximum antioxidant potential. Hence, it was further evaluated for its in vivo anti-ulcer activity by Pyloric Ligation (PL) and Water Immersion Stress (WIS) induced ulcer models in rat. In PL model gastric volume, <b>free</b> and total <b>acidity</b> of MECS were measured at 150 and 300 mg kg - 1 doses. The ulcerative index was measured in both the models at the same doses. The MECS showed maximum reduction of gastric acid volume, <b>free</b> and total <b>acidity</b> such as 41, 48 and 29 % at 300 mg kg - 1 dose, respectively. The ulcerative index inhibition in PL and WIS models {{was found to be}} 52. 5 and 62. 7 %, respectively at higher dose.

Linoleic and oleic acids (approximately 53 - 54 % and 30 - 31 %, respectively) were detected as the major fatty acids in both oil samples. Fifteen different sterols with a majority of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were quantified in both oil samples. Although phenolic compounds were not quantified in the refined winterized oil samples, some flavonoids (hesperidin, rutin) and phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, rosmaniric and trans-ferulic) were detected in the cold pressed oil samples. This study concludes that cold pressed corn oils could be superior in terms of bioactive compounds but still need some quality improvements for sensory attributes...|$|R
