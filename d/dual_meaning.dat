500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had <b>dual</b> <b>meaning.</b> With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} not comfortable with the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer, I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the <b>dual</b> <b>meaning</b> referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E
500|$|When Rep. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina {{looked to}} prevent anti-slavery {{petitions}} {{from reaching the}} House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported {{what came to be}} known as the gag rule, which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836. He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery Herald of Freedom as a [...] "doughface", which had the <b>dual</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "craven-spirited man" [...] and [...] "northerner with southern sympathies". Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the Herald of Freedom article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one in 33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun read the article on the Senate floor as [...] "proof" [...] that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one in 33 figure.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the daily}} Amidah prayer, the central prayer in Jewish services, the {{petitions}} {{to accept the}} [...] "fire offerings of Israel" [...] and [...] "the grain-offering of Judah and Jerusalem" [...] (Malachi 3:4) are removed. In the special Mussaf Amidah prayer said on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, the Hebrew phrase na'ase ve'nakriv (we will present and sacrifice) is modified to read to asu ve'hikrivu (they presented and sacrificed), implying that sacrifices are {{a thing of the}} past. The prayer for the restoration of [...] "the House of our lives" [...] and the Shekhinah to dwell [...] "among us" [...] in the weekday Torah reading service is retained in Conservative prayer books, although not all Conservative services say it. In Conservative prayer books, words and phrases that have <b>dual</b> <b>meaning,</b> referring to both Temple features and theological or poetic concepts, are generally retained. Translations and commentaries, however, generally refer to the poetic or theological meanings only. Conservative Judaism also takes an intermediate position on Kohanim and Levites, preserving patrilineal tribal descent and some aspects of their roles, but lifting restrictions on whom Kohanim are permitted to marry.|$|E

40|$|In 2001, Elliot and McGregor {{proposed}} a 2 × 2 (mastery–performance × approach– avoidance) achievement goal frameworks {{and developed a}} questionnaire to mea sure four goals (mastery–approach, mastery–avoidance, performance–approach, and performance–avoidance goals). This study examines the <b>dual</b> <b>meanings</b> of items in 2 × 2 achievement goal questionnaires by confirmatory factor analysis with an uncorrelated trait and uncorrelatedmethod model and multidimensional scaling technique. A total of 2, 111 freshmen completed the Achievement Goal Questionnaire for General Academics, {{and a total of}} 1, 014 university students in Taiwan provided their ratings on the Chinese Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Physical Education. Confirmatory factor analysis results show that the uncorrelatedtrait and uncorrelatedmethod model is better than the 2 × 2 fourfactor model, supporting the <b>dual</b> <b>meanings</b> of items. In addition, multidimensional scaling results show that items can be plotted on a twodimensional (mastery–performance and approach–avoidance) map, in which four quadrants represent one type of goal. The evidence indicates that the items in the Chinese Achievement Goal Questionnaire for Physical Education have adequate construct validity in their <b>dual</b> <b>meanings</b> derived from the combinations of mastery– performance and approach–avoidance dimensions...|$|R

50|$|The {{title of}} the album, Open, has <b>dual</b> <b>meanings.</b> One meaning is being open {{in a way that}} is dangerous, and the other meaning is the {{beneficial}} idea of open arms, open smile. Perennial art director David Houghton used an image of a venus flytrap to express both meanings. The plant is wide open, ready to catch its prey, being both open and threatening. The Cowboy Junkies also explore, defining and re-defining the meaning of open through their music.|$|R
