50|$|Mobile local search {{services}} are usually provided today by mobile carriers, directory <b>enquiry</b> providers, mobile <b>messaging</b> operators or Yellow Pages publishers. Behind these outlets, {{there is a}} growing network of agencies, distributors and software providers, some of whom are now starting to offer service direct to the public. Search giants, like Yahoo and Google, and big web publishers, such as Amazon.con and eBay have already embarked on this potentially lucrative market segment.|$|R
40|$|The Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) is {{building}} a system that will provide a two-degree field of view at prime focus. A robot positioner {{will be used to}} locate up to 400 optical fibers at pre-determined positions in this field. While observations are being made using one set of 400 fibers, the robot will be positioning a second set of fibers in a background field that can be moved in to replace the first when the telescope is moved to a new position. The fibers feed two spectrographs each with a 1024 square CCD detector. The software system being produced to control this involves Vaxes for overall control and data recording, UNIX workstations for fiber configuration calculations and on-line data reduction, and VME systems running VxWorks for real-time control of critical parts such as the positioner robot. The system {{has to be able to}} interact with the observatory's present data acquisition systems, which use the ADAM system. As yet, the real-time parts of ADAM have not been ported to Unix, and so we are having to produce a smaller-scale system that is similar but inherently distributed (which ADAM is not). We are using this system as a testbed for ideas that we hope may eventually influence an ADAM II system. The system we are producing is based on a message system that is designed to be able to handle inter-process and inter-processor messages of any length, efficiently, and without ever requiring a task to block (i. e., be unresponsive to 'cancel' <b>messages,</b> <b>enquiry</b> <b>messages),</b> other than when deliberately waiting for external input - all of which will be through such messages. The essential requirement is that a message 'send' operation should never be able to block. The messages will be hierarchical, self-defining, machine-independent data structures. This allows us to provide very simple monitoring of messages for diagnostic purposes, and allows general purpose interface programs to be written without needing to share precise byte by byte message format definitions. Programs in this system have interfaces defined simply in terms of named actions and their parameters. Real-time control programs are required to be able to handle a number of such actions concurrently; data reduction programs will normally only need to handle one action at a time ('process an image', 'display a spectrum', etc) ...|$|R
40|$|From March 4 – May 31 2002, The Open University Library piloted a new, instant <b>messaging</b> <b>enquiry</b> {{service for}} use by its {{distance}} learners, called Librarians On Call. The service enabled OU distance learners to remain online using electronic library resources, whilst also obtaining instant help from a librarian, without the need to disconnect from the internet to use the telephone. Student reaction to the service was overwhelmingly positive, {{and as a result}} the Open University has decided to continue the Librarians On Call service. Exit surveys conducted with students indicated students preferred the Librarians On Call service to both email and the telephone, and that they found the service both beneficial and easy to use. The article details the results of the pilot, and also discusses some of the practical issues encountered whilst setting up the service, such as software selection and staffing...|$|R
5000|$|Once back in Israel, Cassel and {{his brother}} were interviewed on Israeli {{television}} Channel 2. The interview set off a stream of <b>enquiries</b> and congratulatory <b>messages</b> from Israeli families having children with Down syndrome. Many of the callers told Cassel they wished they {{had the courage to}} take their brothers or sisters on a holiday like he did. “And I thought what a shame it would be if the experience was only mine,” says Cassel, who then decided to do something that would become {{a turning point in the}} emotional Israeli-India story. He called his friend from the army Itamar Peleg, who would later become a producer of My Hero Brother. Peleg owned Travelog, a travel company in Tel Aviv that organised a trek for disabled Israeli soldiers to India last year. “Enosh (Cassel) and I thought we could organise a trek of Israelis with siblings having Down syndrome,” says Peleg. After a search and contact that lasted for almost a year, ten Israelis — eight men and two women — having siblings with Down syndrome said they would join the expedition. With Enosh and Hannan making themselves available for the trek, the team strength rose to 22 brothers and sisters. India was chosen as the destination. “India is a land of spirituality. The people are friendly and the landscape is amazing,” says Peleg. “It is also a popular destination for young Israeli backpackers.” ...|$|R
