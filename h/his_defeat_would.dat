25|$|The 1906 Teamster {{international}} convention opened in Chicago on August 6, 1906. Fistfights erupted among the delegates, and the Chicago police {{were called to}} quell what nearly turned into a riot. Initially, Young appeared to have enough delegates to unseat Shea. But Shea made a dramatic speech on the convention floor {{in which he said}} <b>his</b> <b>defeat</b> <b>would</b> ensure his conviction in his upcoming conspiracy trials and enable the union's foes to destroy the Teamsters. Shea also pledged that, if acquitted, he would resign the presidency in favor of a unity candidate. In a series of test votes over procedural and policy issues, it became apparent that Shea's speech had turned the tide and he now held a better than two-to-one edge in votes. After the test votes, 50 delegates followed Young out of the convention hall on August 9 to form their own organization, the United Teamsters of America (UTA). Samuel Gompers was called to Chicago to help prevent the breach, but his mediation efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful. Shea was re-elected president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters by a vote of 157 to 14.|$|E

50|$|The {{essay on}} Ibsen has biographical {{relevance}} and even poignance for James, who would experience {{a very public}} failure in the theater {{just a few years}} after this book was published.

The non-partisan race for the court seat was also characterized as a proxy battle or referendum on the administration of Governor Walker and other Republican officials. Both candidates indicated their unhappiness regarding the increasingly partisan nature of the race, with Prosser claiming that <b>his</b> <b>defeat</b> <b>would</b> mean the end of judicial independence.|$|E

After the battle against Zetton, both Hayata and Ultraman were shaken to core following their previous defeat. Past monsters were mysteriously revived and Ultraman defeated them again but is once again weakened by Zetton.

He had wrestled with temptation and been overcome, and he gloried in <b>his</b> <b>defeat.</b> He <b>would</b> make no further effort to stifle his love.

She protests her love to Merlin, declaring he cannot love her if he doubts her. When he mentions Arthur's knights' gossip about her, she slanders every one of them. Merlin meets every accusation but one: that of Lancelot's illicit love, which he admits is true. Worn down, he allows himself to be seduced, and tells Vivien {{how to work the}} charm. She immediately uses it on him, and so he is imprisoned forever, as if dead to anyone but her, in a hollow, nearby oak tree.|$|E

40|$|Will {{foreign policy}} {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} the presidential election of 2004 ? Drawn narrowly to include only the traditional questions of war and diplomacy, foreign policy is often peripheral to the campaign discourse in American elections, particularly since 1992. Several factors suggest, however, that 2004 will be an election in which foreign policy plays a fundamental role in the outcome. Because of the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the continuing threat of further terror attacks against American and allied interests, foreign policy questions are selected by many voters as the most important. In particular, the war in Iraq seems to be activating unlikely participants in the election, as well as splitting off some key partisan constituencies from their traditional loyalties. In addition, the other major influences on American presidential elections are not leaning strongly for or against either candidate, as will be shown. Into that unusual vacuum, foreign policy emerges as the deciding factor, regardless of whether the election of 2004 is exceedingly close or surprisingly lop-sided. Not only will foreign policy be unusually decisive in the election, in an unprecedented fashion in the modern era, but the impact of the election’s outcome upon America’s foreign policy will be vast. The foreign policy of George W. Bush represents a stark shift away from the traditions of American foreign policy. His reelection would likely direct American foreign policy in a new direction for decades. <b>His</b> <b>defeat</b> <b>would</b> signal instead at least a partial repudiation of his new doctrines. In terms of foreign policy Página 2 de 19 consequences before the American electorate, there may have been no graver choices presented to the public since 1964 or perhaps even 1900. ...|$|E

Despite this, Ferland had regularly played second-fiddle to Jean-Michel Ménard when it came to Quebec Brier playdowns. Since winning the 2007 provincial championship with Charette, Ferland lost three straight provincial finals frin 2008 to 2010, the first two were against Ménard.

Ramírez recommended assault with their knives after the first shot was spent, to avoid the response of the best tactical rifle the French used. He ended the speech announcing that he ordered the death penalty, to shoot any retreating Spanish soldier, even himself. In this way everyone was forced to realize that it was better to die fighting than by being dishonorably shot. His final exclamation was [...] "long live Fernando VII, a Prince personified in those moments the best Spanish hopes." ...|$|R
25|$|The Republican {{effort to}} elect Donelon {{to hold the}} Treen seat fell short. Tauzin prevailed with 62,108 votes (53.1 percent) to Donelon's 54,815 ballots (46.9 percent). Donelon's 2/3 {{majority}} in Jefferson Parish was insufficient to offset huge Tauzin majorities in Lafourche, St. Charles, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Terrebonne parishes. In Iberia Parish, the two split the vote, with Tauzin securing 50.1 percent. The turnout in the May 17 special election runoff was 116,923, compared to 82,462 in the April 19 first round of balloting. The greater participation occurred despite flooding that inundated much of south Louisiana the previous day. Donelon announced after <b>his</b> <b>defeat</b> that he <b>would</b> not challenge Tauzin for a full term later in the year. Tauzin became unbeatable in the district. Even when he switched parties, he was then untouchable by a Democratic opponent.|$|R
60|$|Poor girl! {{what she}} then suffered! I could never entirely forgive Raymond for the trials he imposed on her, occasioned {{as they were}} by a selfish feeling on his part. He had schemed, if he failed in his present attempt, without taking leave of any of us, to embark for Greece, and never again to revisit England. Perdita acceded to his wishes; for his contentment was the chief object of her life, the crown of her enjoyment; but to leave us all, her companions, the beloved {{partners}} of her happiest years, and in the interim to conceal this frightful determination, was a task that almost conquered her strength of mind.

5000|$|In 1912, the People's Power League, led by William S. U'Ren, {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the Oregon Constitution to allow each legislator to cast a number of votes equal to the number of votes he received in the last election. Thus, a legislator who received 25,000 votes would have had more voting power than two legislators who received 12,000 votes apiece. A majority of all the votes cast at the preceding election would have been required to pass a law. This proposal would have abolished the Oregon Senate and placed the state's legislative power in a single assembly of sixty members serving four-year terms. The Governor of Oregon and <b>his</b> <b>defeated</b> rivals <b>would</b> have been ex officio members of the Assembly representing voters whose candidate was defeated. If a Socialist legislative candidate were defeated, for instance, then the votes of his supporters would have been cast in the Assembly by the Socialist candidate for Governor. The measure failed by a vote of 71,183 to 31,020. That same year, a similar measure was contained in a proposed new Portland charter called The Short Charter. Article 22 provided simply, [...] "A majority of all the votes cast at the election and represented in the commission, as in this article provided, shall be necessary to pass any measure.

Soon enough, Slime Lord is challenged by Kongo for custody of Sanzoh, who proves to be a cunning adversary for the Slime Lord, but realizes that his physical attacks {{have no effect on}} Slime Lord due to the latter's body being of rubbery slime like substance. Before Slime Lord has a chance to destroy Kongo, Runlay challenges Slime Lord in defiance. After Kongo manages to retrieve Runlay's dragon stone, the young dragon is able to defeat the Slime Lord with true ease. Following <b>his</b> <b>defeat,</b> Slime Lord <b>would</b> be seen as a small eel (small enough to fit in a small sack).
