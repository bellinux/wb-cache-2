25|$|Equipped with B-1B Lancer, the 9th Bomb Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 October 1993 at Dyess AFB, Texas. It assumed {{responsibility for}} all B-1B <b>initial</b> <b>qualification</b> and instructor upgrade training for Air Combat Command. Since 2000, it has provided bombing, airlift support, training and combat support to combatant commanders.|$|E
25|$|In the beginning, {{the plan}} was for unit aircrews to provide three {{categories}} of training: <b>initial</b> <b>qualification,</b> re-qualification and aircraft commander upgrade. Today, the 189th Airlift Wing is the home to the only C-130 schoolhouse for C-130 aircrews to become instructors in their respective crew positions. The unit has been the exclusive provider of that training since 1998.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 1968, the 340th Bombardment Group (Medium) was {{activated}} at Carswell AFB, Texas. Although it {{was given}} the designation of a bomb group, the 340th was organized and functioned as a SAC Wing. Its operational squadron was the 4007th Combat Crew Training Squadron (CCTS). The 340th BMG was given the primary mission of conducting <b>initial</b> <b>qualification</b> training for General Dynamics FB-111A aircrew members. The FB-111A was the all-weather strategic bombing version of the F-111 strike aircraft, intended as an interim successor to the B-52 Stratofortress and B-58 Hustler of the Strategic Air Command.|$|E

50|$|On July 1, 1993, the {{squadron}} {{came under the}} Air Education and Training Command. The squadron was the sole source for <b>initial</b> <b>qualifications</b> and advanced training in C-141 strategic airlift aircraft. It was selectively manned to train C-141 aircrew members in airland, aerial delivery and aerial refueling. The 57th flew approximately 2,000 sorties and 8,500 hours annually to provide specialized flight training to over 900 students.|$|R
25|$|As of January 2012 the {{squadron}} instructs five comprehensive courses. The primary {{course is the}} nine-month Undergraduate Air Battle Manager Training course, where officers learn everything from radar theory to large force employment. Graduates of this course receive follow-on assignments to the combat Air Forces to perform air battle management on the Boeing E-3 Sentry or the Boeing E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. Additional courses include the Battle Manager Instructor Training Course, which teaches air battle managers from different backgrounds {{the skills necessary to}} instruct undergraduate students, and the Air Weapons Officer/Weapons Director <b>Initial</b> <b>Qualification</b> Training Course, which teaches previously qualified air battle managers and weapons directors the art and science of controlling live aircraft. The 325th ACS also conducts the International Air Weapons Controller Course and the Theater Air Operations Course, where officers from around the world are introduced to weapons control and theater air operations.|$|E
2500|$|Optometrists are not {{permitted}} to use the title [...] "Doctor" [...] based on their <b>initial</b> <b>qualification</b> (BOptom or BSc (Optom)). [...] Optometrists can earn PhDs or Doctor of Optometry degrees (in the UK a PhD-level qualification for qualified optometrists with experience in practice). Ophthalmologists are fully qualified medical doctors. However, ophthalmology is considered a branch of surgery, thus ophthalmologists, like other surgeons in the UK, do not use the title [...] "Doctor".|$|E
2500|$|... The {{courses of}} <b>initial</b> <b>qualification</b> can be {{promoted}} by schools lecturing the third cycle of mandatory education. If it is necessary, schools can establish protocols with other {{institutions such as}} municipalities, enterprises or vocational training centres. These courses are open to a) youngsters who have a 9th grade diploma, without any vocational qualification, and who {{do not intend to}} continue their studies; and b) youngsters who, having reached fifteen years of age and attended the 9th grade, did not achieve the basic education certificate.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between entry qualifications and performance throughout the medical course was studied in individual cohorts of students admitted {{in the years}} 1977 to 1981. A modest but significant relationship with overall <b>initial</b> <b>qualifications</b> was found throughout the course. Students without biology showed a marked disadvantage {{in the first year}} but the effect did not persist. There were quite marked variations in all these effects between cohorts; studying only a single cohort could lead to inappropriate conclusions...|$|R
