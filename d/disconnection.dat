5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (<b>disconnection</b> from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E

5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the <b>disconnection</b> between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

This paper addresses {{the problem of}} <b>disconnections</b> between nodes in these systems. <b>Disconnections</b> in a context aware system may occur because of node mobility, network failures or node failures. A research opportunity lies in improving the robustness of such systems to <b>disconnections.</b> While traditional distributed systems methods of improving robustness {{in the face of}} <b>disconnections</b> can be applied to context aware systems, the additional metadata available to them may be leveraged to provide smarter caching algorithms.

5|$|After {{a delayed}} release from late 2012 to March 2013, Tomb Raider {{received}} much anticipation and hype. Upon release, {{the game was}} well received, with critics praising the graphics, the gameplay, Luddington's performance as Lara, and Lara's characterization and development, although {{the addition of a}} multiplayer mode was not well received and some reviewers directed criticism towards the <b>disconnection</b> between the narrative and the player's actions during gameplay. Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release, and has sold more than 8.5 million copies as of April 2015, making it the best-selling Tomb Raider title to date. An updated version, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC. A sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was released in November 2015.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental <b>disconnection</b> or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this. In 2005, when {{he knew he would}} be faced with being sent to the organization's prison-like program the Rehabilitation Project Force, Headley decided to leave. Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of <b>disconnection.</b> Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike {{by the side of the}} road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a programming model for autonomous systems. Autonomous systems are distributed systems based on wireless networks, mobile devices and the Internet. They are characterized by the high dynamics with which their configuration evolves. Ad hoc networks, a member of autonomous systems, illustrate this point since in these networks participants can join and leave at any time. Similarly in Peer-to-Peer networks, another member of autonomous systems, users can abruptly decide to no longer share their resources and to join only when needed. Besides voluntary <b>disconnections</b> decided by users, autonomous systems also suffer from <b>disconnections</b> caused by the infrastructure, e. g. network failures, latency, node failures, etc [...] . <b>Disconnections</b> are therefore a key issue in autonomous systems. Programming distributed systems has always proven to be difficult, but programming distributed systems where <b>disconnections</b> {{play a major role}} is even more difficult...|$|R
40|$|Twin {{boundary}} {{motion is}} the mechanism {{that drives the}} plastic deformation in magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs), and is largely dependent on the twin microstructure of the MSMA. The twin microstructure is established during the martensitic transformation, and can be influenced through thermo-magneto-mechanical training. For self-accommodated and ineffectively trained martensite, twin thickness and magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS) are very small. For effectively trained crystals, a single crystallographic domain may comprise the entire sample and MFIS reaches the theoretical limit. In this paper, a numerical simulation is presented describing the twin microstructures and twin boundary motion of self-accommodated martensite using disclinations and <b>disconnections</b> (twinning dislocations). Disclinations are line defects such as dislocations, however with a rotational displacement field. A quadrupole solution was chosen to approximate the defect structure where two quadrupoles represent an elementary twin double layer unit. In the simulation, the twin boundary was inclined to the twinning plane which required the introduction of twinning <b>disconnections,</b> which are line defects with a stress field similar to dislocations. The shear stress - shear strain properties of self-accommodated martensite were analyzed numerically for different initial configurations of the twin boundary (i. e. for different initial positions of the <b>disconnections).</b> The shear stress - shear strain curve {{was found to be}} sensitive to the initial configuration of <b>disconnections.</b> If the <b>disconnections</b> are very close to boundaries of hierarchically higher twins. such as is the case for self-accommodated martensite, there is a threshold stress for twin-boundary motion. If the <b>disconnections</b> are spread out along the twin boundary, twinning occurs at much lower stress...|$|R
5|$|Milford Haven {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although {{it is the most}} westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5% of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read and write the language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18% of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40% of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh. Local <b>disconnection</b> from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations.|$|E
5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause <b>disconnection</b> events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E

Ports to both the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Nintendo Switch were announced as being in development in August 2016. These ports will both be released in 2017; the PS4 version will release on August 17, and the Switch version on September 21, 2017. With {{the announcement of the}} Switch version, Square Enix offered players the option of switching their characters and progress to the Switch version. In addition to the standard home console releases, versions for potable and mobile platforms have been released that rely on cloud streaming, needing an internet connection to function. A version for Android and iOS was co-developed by Square Enix with NTT DoCoMo and Ubitus: NTT DoCoMo's dGame service was used as the release platform, while Ubitus' cloud technology was used for the streaming. It released on December 16, 2013. A second version was developed for the 3DS, using a similar streaming function to the mobile versions. This version released on September 4, 2014. On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, <b>disconnection</b> issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too small for the 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they could fix the issues.|$|E

30|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networking}} {{is difficult}} in general. In case of CR-VANETs, V 2 V communication {{is more complex}} and difficult because of dynamically evolving topologies and frequent <b>disconnections</b> that are due to vehicles going out of range. This happens more often when the vehicular density is low. Such <b>disconnections</b> can create instability and performance issues for upper layer protocols such as routing and transport (TCP). Some cross-layer strategies to optimize transport protocols, for example TCP, can also be explored such as in [100, 101]. For routing in vehicular networks, some approaches based on delay-tolerant networking (DTN) are becoming popular. DTN approaches can help in improving the stability and performance of routing protocols by providing some tolerance to disruptions. Thus, CR-VANETs routing protocols also need to integrate some DTN elements to counter frequent <b>disconnections,</b> apart from being spectrum aware.|$|R
