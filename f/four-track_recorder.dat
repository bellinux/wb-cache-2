5|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt {{combines}} avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, {{piano and}} various effects on a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b> The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during {{the recording of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, Usually Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market, only to be re-released in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Page and Robertson {{continued}} {{performing and}} also began writing songs together. The band's first tape, Buck Naked (1989), was recorded on a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group Corky and the Juice Pigs, {{to whom they}} give credit for exposing them {{to the idea of}} comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape, and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour. One night, in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited their friends, brothers Andy Creeggan (percussion) and Jim Creeggan (bass), whom they knew from music camp, to play with them at a Christmas time club show. Barenaked Lunch (a.k.a. The Pink Tape) was released in 1990, and featured the two new band members. The tape had problems, however, as it was mastered incorrectly and played too fast.|$|E
500|$|... "Circles" [...] {{was one of}} five Harrison {{compositions}} {{that the}} Beatles demoed before recording their 1968 double album, The Beatles, {{also known as the}} White Album. The song was taped in late May 1968 at Kinfauns, Harrison's home in Esher, using his Ampex <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b> Although never released officially, the demo began circulating on bootleg compilations in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom is a [...] "best of" [...] {{recording}} by Jana Hunter in 2005. It is {{the first}} release on Devendra Banhart's Gnomonsong record label. The album was recorded on two- and <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders,</b> and computers. Most of the recording was done by Jana herself in Texas.|$|R
5|$|Are You Experienced and its {{preceding}} singles {{were recorded}} over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album {{was completed in}} sixteen recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Chandler booked many of the sessions at Olympic because the facility was acoustically superior and equipped {{with most of the}} latest technology, though it was still using <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders,</b> whereas American studios were using eight-track.|$|R
50|$|Beau Sorenson {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} {{northwest}} Wisconsin. Beau took piano and guitar lessons, played in his high school band, and tried his hand playing in a few bands when he was a teenager, but didn't take the normal garage band route to becoming a recording engineer. Living in a remote area provided him with space for making lots of noise taking apart and building all types of electronics, and for experimenting with <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders,</b> synthesizers, and drum machines.|$|R
500|$|Having become {{available}} on bootleg albums from 1991 onwards, Harrison's 1968 demo {{was released on}} the Beatles' Anthology 3 compilation in October 1996. Recorded on an Ampex <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder,</b> the demo features Harrison playing two acoustic guitar parts, and a double-tracked lead vocal. Harrison performed [...] "Piggies" [...] throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton and at his Natural Law Party concert in London in April 1992. With synthesizers replicating the classical arrangement, a version recorded at the Tokyo Dome on 15 December 1991 appears on Harrison's Live in Japan double album.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{returning}} to D.C., the Teen Idles were asked by Skip Groff, {{owner of the}} Washington record store Yesterday and Today, to record some tracks at Inner Ear , a small recording studio in Arlington, Virginia. They were introduced to engineer and owner Don Zientara (the [...] "studio" [...] was a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> at Zientara's house). The Teen Idles played live in the basement while Zientara engineered and Groff produced. Seven tracks were recorded in total. However, the band were undecided {{about what to do}} with the tapes and eventually shelved them.|$|E
500|$|At fourteen, Smith {{left his}} mother's home in Texas {{and moved to}} Portland, Oregon {{to live with his}} father, then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith began using drugs, {{including}} alcohol, with friends. He also began experimenting with recording for the first time after borrowing a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b> At high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction and A Murder of Crows, billed as either Steven Smith or [...] "Johnny Panic". He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Solon joined Thirty Seconds to Mars playing guitar. He {{left the}} band in 2003 due to {{issues related to}} touring. Since 30 Seconds to Mars, Solon has played in a {{revolving}} array of bands such as All Smiles, Earlimart and Sea Wolf. Over the years Solon and Rachel Stolte had been trading music recorded on their own <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders.</b> Eventually this led to creation of Great Northern. Solon, {{in order to get}} a band together, asked Davey Latter to join. Latter originally played bass guitar but later moved to drums when Ashley Dzerigian joined.|$|R
50|$|The group {{began as}} a home {{recording}} project for founding members Nic McKenzie and Nick Weaver while in their mid teens, using <b>four-track</b> tape <b>recorders,</b> broadcast microphones, analog synths and unconventional computer programs.|$|R
500|$|After his {{successful}} performance with his group Precise at the Apollo Theater in 1991, D'Angelo received a US$500 check {{for his work}} at the venue and used most of it to purchase a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> and a keyboard. At his mother's house in Richmond, he began writing and recording most of the material that would constitute Brown Sugar during 1991 and 1992. Recording for the album took place during 1994 and 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City, and at the Pookie Lab studio in Sacramento, California, which served as the personal recording studio of R musician and record producer Raphael Saadiq. Additional recording took place at Back Pocket Studios in New York City for the track [...] "Cruisin'".|$|E
500|$|DJ Shadow {{began his}} music career in 1989 as a disc jockey for the University of California, Davis campus radio station KDVS. He had {{previously}} experimented with a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> {{in his high}} school years to create music utilizing samples, having been inspired by other sample-based music such as It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988) by American hip hop group Public Enemy. His KDVS work impressed A representative Dave [...] "Funken" [...] Klein, leading him to sign DJ Shadow to the Hollywood BASIC label to produce music and remixes. DJ Shadow's output during this period – including the 17-minute-long [...] "Entropy" [...] and his work with the Solesides crew – {{brought him to the}} attention of British musician James Lavelle, who then signed DJ Shadow to his Mo' Wax label.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine {{experienced}} {{a number of}} line-up changes during their initial months. Lead guitarist Stephen Ivers and bassist Mark Ross were recruited in April 1983 and the band would often rehearse near Smithfield and Temple Bar in rehearsal spaces owned by Aidan Walsh. Walsh, who booked some of the band's early performances, said the rehearsals were [...] "too noisy" [...] and [...] "crazy" [...] that [...] "next door were giving out hell". Ross left the band in December 1983 {{and was replaced by}} Paul Murtagh, who left the band in early 1984. In March 1984, Shields, Ivers and Conway recorded the band's first demo on a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> in Shields' parents' home in Killiney. Shields and Ó Cíosóig overdubbed bass and drum tracks at Litton Lane Studios, and the tape was later used to secure a contract with Tycoon Records.|$|E
5000|$|Springsteen {{wrote in}} his Greatest Hits sleeve notes that he {{recorded}} the track in his bedroom [...] "for $1,050 (the cost of the <b>four-track</b> Tascam <b>recorder),</b> mixed through an old Gibson guitar unit to a beat box." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first album}} was {{recorded}} on a <b>four-track</b> tape <b>recorder,</b> as was typical for 1967. Due {{to the limited}} number of tracks, most of the fictional non-band [...] "guest stars" [...] were simply faded in and out as required.|$|R
50|$|The album {{marked a}} change in Iron & Wine's sound, as {{it was his first}} {{produced}} in a professional studio. Beam's only previous album, The Creek Drank the Cradle, was recorded entirely on a <b>four-track</b> tape <b>recorder</b> at his home.|$|R
500|$|The Beatles {{recorded}} a demo of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] at Harrison's Esher home, Kinfauns, in May 1968, while preparing material for their self-titled double album, {{also known as}} [...] "the White Album". The demo was taped on Harrison's Ampex <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b> The performance features Harrison singing falsetto throughout, and a musical backing that includes guitars and percussion. Although the subsequent album sessions were marked by disharmony {{and a lack of}} cooperation among the band members, author and critic Kenneth Womack notes that the Kinfauns demos [...] "witness the Beatles working in unison and exalting in the pure joy of their music". Leng similarly describes the group's performance of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as an [...] "exciting" [...] version [...] "layed with real enthusiasm". The recording has appeared on bootleg albums, including Acoustic Masterpieces (The Esher Demos).|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder,</b> which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So I take my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{recorded}} using four-track equipment. Although eight-track tape recorders {{were available in}} the US, the first units were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967. As with previous Beatles albums, the Sgt. Pepper recordings made extensive use of the technique known as reduction mixing, in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the Abbey Road engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio. EMI's Studer J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process. Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the extra time required to write and record melodic basslines that complemented the song's final arrangement. When recording the orchestra for [...] "A Day in the Life", Martin synchronised a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50Hz control signal between the two machines.|$|E
50|$|Time End is {{the second}} release by Leviathan. It was {{recorded}} sometime in 1998 by sole member Wrest in his California home on a Tascam <b>four-track</b> tape <b>recorder.</b> After its initial release on cassette it saw a CD-R re-release limited to sixty-six copies.|$|R
5000|$|... dbx Type I {{was widely}} adopted in {{professional}} recording, particularly used {{with what is}} {{referred to in the}} industry as [...] "semi-pro" [...] formats such as half-inch 8 track and one-inch 16 track. Tascam incorporated dbx Type II in their Portastudio <b>four-track</b> cassette <b>recorders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide is {{the debut}} studio album by American black metal musical act Leviathan. It was {{recorded}} entirely on a Tascam <b>four-track</b> tape <b>recorder</b> in mainman Wrest's home, {{and was released}} September 29, 2003 by Seattle, Washington-based underground record label Moribund Cult.|$|R
500|$|The trio {{began to}} {{practice}} together in Raynor's bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies, and playing practical jokes. Hoppus and DeLonge would alternate singing vocal parts. The trio first operated under {{a variety of}} names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band [...] "Blink". Hoppus' girlfriend was angered by her boyfriend's constant attention to the band, and demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a demo tape, with Jones on bass. Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom in May 1993. Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene. In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to the group's music. [...] "New York is gloomy, dark and cold. It makes different music. The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about," [...] said DeLonge. San Diego at this time was [...] "hardly a hotbed of [...] activity", but the band's popularity grew as did California punk rock concurrently in the mainstream. DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as calling up local high schools, convincing them that Blink was a [...] "motivational band with a strong antidrug message" [...] in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Rocket Science's' first gig was at The Jug of Ale in Moseley, Birmingham. The duo played simple FM {{synthesis}} keyboards {{put through}} numerous guitar effects pedals, acoustic guitar, bass guitar and various tone generators {{and used a}} <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder</b> to play back a combination of processed found sounds, film dialogue, and distorted breakbeats. Their music {{at this early stage}} was instrumental and often repetitive, recalling the sounds of early techno-ambient albums by Aphex Twin, and the lush washes of Brian Eno. Performing music that required a certain level of calm and concentration {{on the part of the}} audience brought with it certain concerns: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} line-up of Rishikesh {{formed in}} Sydney in 1994 when vocalist and lead guitarist Craig Nicholls and bass guitarist Patrick Matthews met whilst working at their local McDonald's in the suburb of South Hurstville, New South Wales. They were soon joined by Matthews' school friend David Olliffe on drums. The name [...] "Rishikesh", suggested by Olliffe, {{refers to the}} Indian city where the Beatles visited an ashram in 1968. The local newspapers regularly misprinted the name as [...] "Rishi Chasms", so Nicholls suggested a new name, [...] "the Vines", as an homage to his father, who fronted a local band called the Vynes. The group started performing Nirvana and You Am I covers at backyard parties while developing their sound on Nicholls' <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Secret Cities is an {{independent}} rock band from North Dakota. Its founding members, Charles Gokey and Marie J. Parker, met at a band camp in July 2001, while in high school. Although the two lived 500 km apart, in Fargo, North Dakota and Williston, North Dakota, respectively, the two started making music by exchanging tapes in the mail and composing using <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders.</b> They continued in this fashion until February 2004, when the pair changed their name to The Foliage and put out their first release on Fall Records, a split with In Ink Please entitled [...] "How to Make Better Love." [...] In July 2005 the band released a mini-LP, Zurich on Fall Records under the moniker The White Foliage. The group also added a third member, Alex Abnos, during {{a tour of the}} Midwest in that year.|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of playing in those bands, Clapp had begun {{recording}} pop songs under his own name using a Radio Shack tie-clip microphone, a Roland RE-201 Space Echo and his Tascam Porta One <b>four-track</b> cassette <b>recorder.</b> The Roland Space Echo would become {{an important part of}} Clapp's production of musical soundscapes, helping him achieve a cool, coastal sound.|$|R
500|$|The Beatles asked {{producer}} Martin {{to come to}} the rescue, so {{he borrowed}} two <b>four-track</b> <b>recorders</b> from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least £300,000 (£4.5 million in 2015 pounds). Starr once approved of one of Mardas’ ideas: [...] "He [...] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio – you’d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren’t interested at all".|$|R
2500|$|Another {{important}} factor in Stax's success was the studio itself. The recording studio, located at 926 E McLemore Ave, in Memphis was a converted movie theater still had the sloped floor where the seats had once been. Because the room was imbalanced, it created an acoustic anomaly that was audible on recordings, often giving them a big, deep yet raw sound. Soul music historian Rob Bowman notes {{that because of the}} distinctive sound, soul music fans can tell often within the first few notes if a song was recorded at Stax. When Tom Dowd first arrived at Stax in 1963 the studio was still using the veteran Ampex mono recorder it had purchased in the late Fifties. Dowd immediately suggested that a two-track recorder should be installed. The Stax team were appalled at the idea, fearing that the distinctive [...] "Stax sound" [...] would be destroyed. However, Dowd pointed out that stereo albums sold for a higher price, which would mean more income for Stax, so in the summer of 1965 he installed an additional two-track recorder, allowing Stax to record sessions simultaneously in mono and stereo, and in 1966 he upgraded the studio further with a <b>four-track</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|E
