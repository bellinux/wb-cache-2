5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit <b>history</b> <b>into</b> natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E

5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work.

5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical <b>history</b> <b>into</b> account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
5|$|The report divided Sa-iap <b>history</b> <b>into</b> four periods. Before 1937, {{the village}} was {{self-sustaining}} and used both farming and gathering for {{the overwhelming majority of}} its needs. In 1937, the Thai government allowed private companies to log the forest, destroying part of the villages' infrastructure. In 1957, the villagers entered the employ of the logging companies, causing internal and external conflict as well as increased reliance on unsustainable practices. Finally, in 1991 the villagers formed a conservation group, the Forest Lover Group, which the Chaobaan researchers agreed cut down on conflict. The mood of the villages has returned to one of mutual assistance and traditional customs.|$|E

5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its <b>history</b> <b>into</b> four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E

40|$|Although {{research}} is increasingly interested in session-based retrieval, comparably little work {{has focused on}} how best to divide web <b>histories</b> <b>into</b> sessions. Most automated attempts to divide web <b>histories</b> <b>into</b> sessions have focused on dividing web logs using simplistic rules, including user identifiers and specific time gaps. This research, however, is focused on understanding the full range of factors that affect the division of sessions, so that we can begin to go beyond current naive techniques like fixed time periods of inactivity. To investigate these factors, 10, 000 log items were manually analysed by their owners into 847 naturally occurring web sessions. During interviews, participants reviewed their own web histories to identify these sessions, and described the causes of divisions between sessions. This paper contributes a taxonomy of six factors {{that can be used to}} better model the divisions between sessions, along with initial insights into how the divided sessions manifested in web logs. The factors in our taxonomy provide focus for future work, including our own, for finding practical ways to more intelligently divide and identify sessions for improved session-based retrieval...|$|R
