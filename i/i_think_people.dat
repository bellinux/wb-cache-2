During the shoot, {{the video}} was documented by MTV; in the interview, Allen declared: I {{wanted to do}} a dance routine, even though I'm not really doing a dance routine, other people are doing it, but I'm part of it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move in front of the camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> [...] that I was an artist on a project. Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> stuck me with something." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Chaiken {{was still}} {{confused}} over Jenny's bad reception, {{of why it}} might be she said: [...] "People read into the character {{that she was a}} manipulator, self-absorbed, and a trouble maker who puts other people in service of her own neurotic agenda. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> react so strongly because Jenny is just a mess in the way that so many people are." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{live the}} life that most would die for, but there's {{a lot of things}} that come with this life. People don't take that into consideration. There are a lot of things in this life that I would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy [...] I just listed a few things that they {{probably}} never viewed from that particular perspective. Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> need to see things another way; they need to see it other than just celebrity.|$|E

So I don’t find it that much of a mystery. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> House is a very attractive character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most <b>people</b> would want to be friends with him.

500|$|Branagh {{said that}} the DVD {{includes}} at least 20 minutes of deleted scenes. Branagh stated the footage contains [...] "things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill {{in a little bit}} of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research."

500|$|Juno actor Jason Bateman {{defended the}} film. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] he said, [...] "we’ve had these {{instances}} where guys kill {{people because of}} what they hear in rock ‘n roll lyrics or some garbage like that. Look, if you’re going to blame a movie or song for your actions, whether they be good or bad, I think you’re looking at the wrong things to influence your life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever. That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears." ...|$|E
500|$|Coldplay {{announced}} {{details about}} [...] "X" [...] in March 2004 while {{the album was}} being recorded. Their initial plans were {{to stay out of}} the public eye throughout the year. Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We really feel that we have to be away for a while and we certainly won't release anything this year, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E

500|$|For this reason, Sony {{titled the}} album #1's, as Carey {{felt the need}} to express the album's true content, a {{collection}} of her number one hits. In December 2001, Columbia released the album Greatest Hits, which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said [...] "needed to be really heard," [...] such as [...] "Underneath the Stars" [...] and [...] "Forever." [...] In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album. [...] "There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are going to like this Greatest Hits because there are songs on it that were not necessarily singles." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine, {{the album}} title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When {{asked about the}} matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that [...] "People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> wanna {{be able to go}} 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'" [...] Mustaine {{went on to say that}} many of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.|$|E
500|$|Little Mix {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of [...] "Wings" [...] with songwriter Iain James and production team TMS, although they invited input from other writers until they found the track complete. It {{was one of the}} first songs written for the group's debut studio album, DNA. Unlike most The X Factor (UK) alumni, the band were adamant on being involved with the writing of their first original single. Band member Perrie Edwards stressed, [...] "At the end of the day, it's our name on it. If we're not happy, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> will see straight through it."

500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E

Nonetheless, Dern said that she was grateful for the [...] "extraordinary experience and opportunity" [...] of being a part of the episode. Speaking of her experience, DeGeneres said, [...] "It was a huge step in my life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>people</b> sensed the honesty in it. I think it helped a lot of people, and still to this day I hear about parents and children being able to have an honest conversation through watching that show. That's ultimately what television can be: It can get conversations started." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Peter Berg said {{prior to}} Hancocks release {{that if the}} film pulls in as much {{business}} as predicted, a sequel, Hancock 2, would likely follow.
