500|$|As {{research}} on nuclear fission progressed in early 1939, Edwin McMillan at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley {{decided to run}} an experiment bombarding uranium using the powerful 60-inch (1.52 m) cyclotron that had recently been built at the university. The purpose was to separate the various fission products produced by the bombardment by exploiting the enormous force that the fragments gain from their mutual electrical repulsion after fissioning. Although he did not discover anything of note from this, McMillan did observe two new beta decay half-lives in the uranium trioxide target itself, which meant that whatever was producing the radioactivity had not violently repelled each other like normal fission products. He quickly realized {{that one of the}} half-lives closely matched the known 23-minute <b>decay</b> <b>period</b> of uranium-239, but the other half-life of 2.3 days was unknown. McMillan took the results of his experiment to chemist and fellow Berkeley professor Emilio Segrè to attempt to isolate the source of the radioactivity. Both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory that element 93 would have similar chemistry to rhenium, but Segrè rapidly determined that McMillan's sample was not at all similar to rhenium. Instead, when he reacted it with hydrogen fluoride (HF) with a strong oxidizing agent present, it behaved much like members of the rare earths. Since these elements comprise a large percentage of fission products, Segrè and McMillan decided that the half-life must have been simply another fission product, titling the paper [...] "An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements".|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{long-term}} simulation of an ocean-biogeochemical coupled model, we investigate the biogeochemical response to {{the two types of}} El Niño events, a Cold Tongue (CT) -El Niño and a Warm Pool (WP) -El Niño, in which a local maximum of anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) is located in the eastern and central tropical Pacific. Our model is able to reasonably simulate the characteristics of the biological variables in a way comparable to the observations. During the developing period, anomalous low chlorophyll appears in the eastern Pacific, while it appears in the central Pacific in the WP-El Niño. The difference in the spatial-temporal response of chlorophyll for the two types of El Niño events is mainly due to the eastward zonal advection of upper ocean currents, which plays a role in bringing nutrient-poor water from the western Pacific. During the <b>decaying</b> <b>period</b> of the WP-El Niño, anomalous high chlorophyll appears concurrently with anomalous low SST in the eastern Pacific. Conversely, anomalous high chlorophyll appears in the central Pacific prior to the <b>decaying</b> <b>period</b> of the CT-El Niño. In particular, the anomalous low sea level from the northwestern Pacific shifts to the southern equatorial region during the <b>decaying</b> <b>period</b> of the CT-El Niño.

30|$|A special fog {{observation}} {{campaign was}} conducted in the Miyoshi basin, Hiroshima prefecture, Japan during the period November 7 – 15, 2000. We observed the spatial distributions of fogs and their movements using a millimeter-wave scanning radar. This {{is the first time}} that the distribution of basin fogs associated with fog development and decay processes has been examined. Echo intensity observed with the radar, which is mainly associated with fog particle size, was almost under − 23 dBZ at levels below 200 m in height. The horizontal distribution of echo intensity changed with time. Namely, weak echoes were observed over nearly all observation areas at first, and then the echoes gradually became stronger as the fogs developed, although the echoes were weaker at higher levels. After sunrise, the echoes decayed. During the developing periods, the occurrence ratio of the echo intensity between − 38 and − 23 dBZ increased from the lower height, while the ratio decreased from the higher levels during the <b>decay</b> <b>periods.</b> This feature in the developing period is consistent with the results of optical measurements but the feature in the <b>decaying</b> <b>period</b> is inconsistent.

50|$|For the NAA {{procedure}} to be successful, the specimen or sample must be selected carefully. In many cases small objects can be irradiated and analysed intact {{without the need}} of sampling. But, more commonly, a small sample is taken, usually by drilling in an inconspicuous place. About 50 mg (one-twentieth of a gram) is a sufficient sample, so damage to the object is minimised. It is often good practice to remove two samples using two different drill bits made of different materials. This will reveal any contamination of the sample from the drill bit material itself. The sample is then encapsulated in a vial made of either high purity linear polyethylene or quartz. These sample vials come in many shapes and sizes to accommodate many specimen types. The sample and a standard are then packaged and irradiated in a suitable reactor at a constant, known neutron flux. A typical reactor used for activation uses uranium fission, providing a high neutron flux and the highest available sensitivities for most elements. The neutron flux from such a reactor is {{in the order of}} 1012 neutrons cm−2 s−1. The type of neutrons generated are of relatively low kinetic energy (KE), typically less than 0.5 eV. These neutrons are termed thermal neutrons. Upon irradiation, a thermal neutron interacts with the target nucleus via a non-elastic collision, causing neutron capture. This collision forms a compound nucleus which is in an excited state. The excitation energy within the compound nucleus is formed from the binding energy of the thermal neutron with the target nucleus. This excited state is unfavourable and the compound nucleus will almost instantaneously de-excite (transmutate) into a more stable configuration through the emission of a prompt particle and one or more characteristic prompt gamma photons. In most cases, this more stable configuration yields a radioactive nucleus. The newly formed radioactive nucleus now decays by the emission of both particles and one or more characteristic delayed gamma photons. This decay process is at a much slower rate than the initial de-excitation and is dependent on the unique half-life of the radioactive nucleus. These unique half-lives are dependent upon the particular radioactive species and can range from fractions of a second to several years. Once irradiated, the sample is left for a specific <b>decay</b> <b>period,</b> then placed into a detector, which will measure the nuclear decay according to either the emitted particles, or more commonly, the emitted gamma rays.|$|E
