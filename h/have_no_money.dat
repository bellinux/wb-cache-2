500|$|The Grand Prince Ferdinando was grievously {{ill with}} syphilis; {{he had become}} prematurely senile, not {{recognising}} anybody who came to see him. Cosimo despaired. He successfully requisitioned the assistance of Pope Clement XI with Anna Maria Franziska. He sent the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her. She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can tell you now, in case you are not informed, that we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> in Florence..." [...] He added that [...] "two or three quarters of my pension are fallen into arrears." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Tubman became heavily {{involved}} with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn. In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for [...] "aged and indigent colored people". The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: [...] "hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> at all." [...] She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.|$|E
500|$|Behind {{the playful}} façade of Candide which has amused so many, there lies very harsh {{criticism}} of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for {{the execution of}} John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in Candide. For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, [...] " [...] are masters of everything, and the people <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> at all…". Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is {{taking advantage of the}} local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.|$|E

500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd be sort of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E
500|$|There {{was wide}} {{commentary}} {{in the news}} media about the social situation in and around Moston. Writing in The Times, Jon Ronson focused on Manchester's apparent economic imbalance, pointing out that while [...] "superficially, it is a city of growth" [...] — hosting international environmental conferences in 1993 and bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games — this could not disguise the realities of the poor quality of [...] "built-to-collapse" [...] housing, the city council's policy on homelessness, poverty, street violence and drug culture, all of which played parts in the events leading up to Capper's murder. The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money,</b> and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past." [...] David Ward, writing in The Guardian, similarly drew attention to the housing policies, and quoted an older Moston resident as saying: [...] "These people are moving in and out every three months. They're illiterate half of them — just shagging and having kids." [...] The Daily Mail – in what Barker and Petley called [...] "ideological overdrive" [...] – described Capper's killers as [...] "the product of a society that tolerates petty crime, the break-up of families and feckless spending... Most of Suzanne's tormentors were on social security... an underclass which is a grave threat to Britain's future." [...] Author Carol Anne Davis agreed that when looking for answers about how this crime came about one need only [...] "look at the upbringings of these women who were single parents to three children by their mid twenties, had teenage boyfriends who were barely legal and who supported themselves through drug dealing and theft." ...|$|E

[...] / [...] "I owe Moishe 20 roubles, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money.</b> What shall I do?" [...] / Sarah bangs on the flimsy wall and shouts to the neighbors: [...] "Moishe! My Abram still owes you 20 roubles? Well he isn't giving them back!" [...] / Turning to her husband, she says reassuringly: [...] "Now go to sleep and let Moishe stay awake!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{gentrification}} of {{skid row}} has drawn criticism from homeless advocates. Alice Callaghan of Las Familias Del Pueblo said, [...] "Skid row {{is the last}} place in the community where a person can go if they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> and no family." [...] Callaghan criticized developers swooping in to buy the area's affordable housing stock: [...] "For them to come and take irreplaceable housing stock {{for people who have}} no choice about where to live, so they can have some Disneyland Manhattan experience, is outrageous and immoral." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul also stated, [...] "why {{do we have}} 900 {{bases in}} 130 {{countries}} and we're totally bankrupt. How do you rebuild a military when we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money?</b> How {{are we going to}} take care of the people? I think this wild goal to have another war in the name of defense is the dangerous thing. The danger is really us overreacting. We need a strong national defense, and we need to only go to war with a declaration of war." [...] Later in the debate, Rick Perry received attention when he called himself the [...] "Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses," [...] when asked how he would compete against President Barack Obama in a general election debate.|$|E
2500|$|Bannon {{was charged}} with {{misdemeanor}} domestic violence, battery and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after Piccard accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The charges were later dropped when his now ex-wife did not appear in court. In an article in The New York Times Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made to her by Bannon and his lawyer: Mr. Bannon, she said, told her that [...] "if I went to court he and his attorney would make sure that I {{would be the one}} who was guilty" ... Mr. Bannon’s lawyer, she said, [...] "threatened me," [...] telling her that if Mr. Bannon went to jail, she [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> and no way to support the children." ... Mr. Bannon’s lawyer ... denied pressuring her not to testify.|$|E

2500|$|Robin Hood disguises {{himself as}} a friar in the forest and {{encounters}} two [...] "lusty" [...] priests on horseback (4.4). He begs the priests for a silver groat, saying he hasn't {{been able to get}} anything to eat or drink all day. The priests explain that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>money</b> because they have been robbed that morning. Robin tells them he thinks they're lying, and at that they speed away on their horses, but Robin soon catches up with them. He pulls them off of their horses, whereupon the priests fall on their knees and promise to pray for money. After they've prayed for an hour, Robin says they will all search themselves for the money heaven has given them. The priests pretend to search themselves and still find no money, but when Robin searches them he finds five hundred pieces of gold, which he lays out on the ground. He gives them each fifty pounds for praying so earnestly and keeps the rest for himself. Relieved to get away physically unharmed, the priests rise from their knees to go, but Robin commands them to stay until they have taken three oaths by the forest's [...] "holy grass": that they never again will lie, that they will never try to persuade maidens to sin or lie with other men's wives, and that they will be charitable to the poor (21.3). The priests go on their way and Robin returns to the forest.|$|E
