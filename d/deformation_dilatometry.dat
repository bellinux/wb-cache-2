The possible implementation of deformation in currently available transformation models for allotriomorphic ferrite and Widmanstätten ferrite is discussed based {{on a series of}} <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry</b> experiments. It is concluded that a small amount of deformation already gives significantly faster transformation kinetics and a significant decrease in fraction Widmanstätten ferrite, and that the key to understanding the effect of deformation on transformation lies in the nucleation of allotriomorphic and Widmanstätten ferrite.

Concerning the shear transformation from austenite into martensite there is a dependency on heating rates and on austenization temperature. Higher tungsten contents make the austenite relatively unstable and leads to effects {{similar to the ones}} at reduced austenization temperatures. Deformation processes lower the transition points, whereby this decrease is directly proportional to the deformation degree.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that in-situ adsorption dilatometry provides a new opportunity for structural characterization of microporous carbons. We present experimental results for CO 2 adsorption at 293 K and in-situ <b>deformation</b> obtained by <b>dilatometry</b> on a synthetic monolithic carbon sample. The carbon deformation {{in the course}} of adsorption is non-monotonic: the strain isotherm shows the sample contraction at low adsorption followed by progressive expansion. To evaluate structural and mechanical properties of the sample from the experimental adsorption and strain isotherms, a kernel of theoretical adsorption isotherms is obtained with the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation of CO 2 adsorption in a series of carbon micropores ranging from 0. 22 to 2. 0 nm. The respective kernel of adsorption stress isotherms is constructed using the thermodynamic model of adsorption stress. The pore volume and surface area distributions were calculated independently from a) the experimental excess adsorption isotherm by deconvoluting the generalized adsorption equation and b) the experimental strain isotherm by using the kernel of adsorption stress isotherms. The proposed method of determining the pore size distribution from the strain isotherm validates the thermodynamic model of adsorption stress in micropores and provides additional information about the sample material with respect to mechanical properties of the microporous matrix...|$|R

According to the results of both dilatometry measurements and microstructure observations, the continuous cooling transformation curves (CCT) of the tested steels are constructed. The results show that Nb content and deformation enhance the formation of acicular ferrite; the microstructure of the steel range from PF, QF to AF with increasing of cooling rates from 0. 5 to 50 °C /s in a two stages controlled rolling and the microstructure revolution is sensitive to cooling rates when it is lower than 5 °C /s, however, when the cooling rate increasing further, the microstructure didn’t change very much but M/A constituents in matrix is refined and dispersed...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{transformation}} {{behavior of a}} low-carbon Mo-Nb linepipe steel and the corresponding transformation product microstructures using <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry.</b> The continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams have been constructed for both the fully recrystallized austenite and that deformed in uniaxial compression at 1148 K (875 °C) to a strain of 0. 5 for cooling rates ranging from 0. 1 to about 100 K/s. The obtained microstructures have been studied in detail using electron backscattered diffraction complemented by transmission electron microscopy. Heavy deformation of the parent austenite has caused a significant expansion of the polygonal ferrite transformation field in the CCT diagram, {{as well as a}} shift in the non-equilibrium ferrite transformation fields toward higher cooling rates. Furthermore, the austenite deformation has resulted in a pronounced refinement in both the effective grain (sheaf/packet) size and substructure unit size of the non-equilibrium ferrite microstructures. The optimum microstructure expected to display an excellent balance between strength and toughness is a mix of quasi-polygonal ferrite and granular bainite (often termed “acicular ferrite”) produced from the heavily deformed austenite within a processing window covering the cooling rates from about 10 to about 100 K/s...|$|E
40|$|<b>Deformation</b> <b>dilatometry</b> {{has been}} used to {{simulate}} controlled hot rolling followed by controlled cooling of a group of low- and ultralow-carbon microalloyed steels containing additions of boron and/or molybdenum to enhance hardenability. Each alloy was subjected to simulated recrystallization and nonrecrystallization rolling schedules, followed by controlled cooling at rates from 0. 1 °C/s to about 100 °C/s, and the corresponding continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed. The resultant microstructures ranged from polygonal ferrite (PF) for combinations of slow cooling rates and low alloying element contents, through to bainitic ferrite accompanied by martensite for fast cooling rates and high concentrations of alloying elements. Combined additions of boron and molybdenum were found to be most effective in increasing steel hardenability, while boron was significantly more effective than molybdenum as a single addition, especially at the ultralow carbon content. Severe plastic deformation of the parent austenite (> 0. 45) markedly enhanced PF formation in those steels in which this microstructural constituent was formed, indicating a significant effective decrease in their hardenability. In contrast, in those steels in which only nonequilibrium ferrite microstructures were formed, the decreases in hardenability were relatively small, reflecting the lack of sensitivity to strain in the austenite of those microstructural constituents forming in the absence of PF. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{current work}} {{contains}} experimental and theoretical work about {{the formation of}} martensite from the austenitic state of the steel Hardox 450. Simulation of rolling and subsequent quenching of martensitic steel plates requires a model that can account for previous deformation, current stresses and the temperature history, therefore dilatometry experiments were performed, with and without deformation. Two austenitization schedules were used and in the standard dilatometry the cooling rates varied between 5 - 100 °C/s, {{in order to find}} the minimum cooling rate that gives a fully martensitic microstructure. Cooling rates larger than 40 °C/s gave a fully martensitic microstructure. The cooling rate of 100 °C/s was used in the <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry</b> tests where the uniaxial deformation varied from 5 - 50 %. The theoretical work involved modelling of the martensite formation and the thermal/transformation strains they cause in the steel. Characterizations were done using light optical microscopy, hardness tests and electron backscatter diffraction technique. The parent austenite grains of the martensitic structure were reconstructed using the orientation relationship between the parent austenite and the martensite. Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationships have previously been proven to work well for low-carbon steels and was therefore selected. The standard implementation of the Koistinen-Marburger equation for martensite formation and a more convenient approach were compared. The latter approach does not require the storage of initial austenite fraction at start of martensite formation. The comparison shows that the latter model works equally well for the martensite formation. The results showed that the use of martensite start and finish temperatures calibrated versus experiments for Hardox 450 works better when computing thermal expansion than use of general relations based on the chemistry of the steel. The results from <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry</b> showed that deformation by compressive uniaxial stresses impedes the martensite transformation. The simplified incremental model works well for deformation with 5 % and 10 %. However, the waviness in the experimental curve for deformation 50 % does not fit the model due vi to large barrelling effect and the large relative expansion for the material that the sample holders are made of. Crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite grains were performed on a hot-rolled as-received reference sample and dilatometry samples cooled with 60 °C/s and 100 °C/s. The misorientation results showed that the samples match with the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship in both hot rolled product and dilatometry samples. When misorientation between adjacent pixels are between 15 ° and 48 °, then the boundary between them was considered as a parent austenite grain. The austenitic grain boundaries of the sample cooled at 100 °C/s is in general identical with the hot rolled sample when considering high angle boundaries (15 °- 48 °). The results from the hardness tests showed that the rolled product exhibits higher hardness as compared to samples cooled by 100 °C/s and 60 °C/s. This {{can be attributed to the}} formation of transition-iron-carbides in the hot rolled product due to longer exposure of coiling temperature...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to study the grain growth during {{reheating}} and phase transformation behaviour during continuous cooling of austenite in five microalloyed steels. Two of these steels were supplied in as-cast slab {{as well as in}} controlled rolled plate conditions. These steels contained similar levels of C (~ 0. 07 %), Ti (~ 0. 013 %) and Mo (~ 0. 2 %) but had different levels of Mn (1. 1 to 1. 7 %) and Nb (0. 03 % to 0. 06 %) contents. The principal aim of this work was to simulate as closely as possible the controlled rolling schedule used in industry for the production of plates in laboratory. Laboratory process simulation was carried out using quench and <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry.</b> Continuous cooling transformation behaviour of the undeformed as well as thermomechanically processed austenite was investigated from the dilatometric data, quantitative optical metallography and microhardness tests. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of the undeformed and thermomechanically processed steels were constructed. Effects of thermomechanical processing (TMP), accelerated cooling and Mn and Nb contents on austenite transformation critical temperature (Ar 3), phase transformation kinetics, CCT diagrams, grain size and hardness were investigated. The experimental work on the grain growth of austenite during reheating involved mainly the determination of Grain Coarsening Temperatures (GCT) for various microalloyed steels. It was found that the conventional method of detecting the GCT from the mean grain size v/s reheating temperature plot was inadequate in locating the abnormal grain growth in some microalloyed steels. An alternative quantitative metallographic method which consists of plotting the mean size of the largest grain function of reheating temperature was therefore developed. The new method was found to be more effective and sensitive in detecting the abnormal grain growth in all microalloyed steels studied. The factors in addition to precipitate dissolution and coarsening which influence the GCT of microalloyed steels were investigated. It was found that a high heterogeneity ratio (Z) present in the initial austenite grain structure (prior to coarsening) can result in lowering the GCT significantly. The reasons why different steels exhibit different values of heterogeneity ratios were also investigated. was found that microstructural features before reheating influences the α→γ transformation which results in different values of Z in different steels. In slab steels, microstructure containing coarse ferrite grains and a small volume fraction of acicular ferrite + pearlite resulted in a high value of Z. In case of plate steels, microstructure consisting of heterogeneous distribution of ferrite grain sizes and a non-uniform distribution of pearlite (banded microstructure) led to the generation of high Z in austenite grain sizes. Grain growth behaviour of plate steels was found to be significantly different than that of slab steels of the same composition. Plate steels exhibited two stages of accelerated grain growth compared to only one stage of accelerated grain growth found in slab steels. Also, abnormal grain growth in plate steels was found to be not as significant as that in slab steels. Empirical mathematical models to predict the grain growth of austenite were critically reviewed. It was found that, for the same starting conditions, predictions from these models differ from one other considerably. Furthermore, none of the models could adequately describe the grain growth behaviour, particularly at higher temperatures, of as-cast slabs. Basic principles of grain growth were therefore revisited in an attempt to develop a mathematical model which can account for abnormal grain growth. A model was developed which also accounts for the effect of initial grain size on the process of grain growth. Supporting mathematical models for the prediction of particle coarsening and dissolution as a function time, temperature and composition were developed. It was found that predictions based on this model were in close agreement with the experimental grain growth data. In the second part, an effort was made to characterise the TMP used in the industry for the production of controlled rolled plates and then to simulate this process as closely possible in the laboratory using quench and <b>deformation</b> <b>dilatometry.</b> Effects of TMP, accelerated cooling and alloying elements (Nb and Mn) on Ar 3 temperature, phase transformation kinetics, grain size, CCT diagrams and microhardness were investigated. It was found that the TMP accelerated the onset of γ/α transformation (γ transformation start temperature, Ar 3, was raised). However, the progress of γ/α transformation was retarded considerably in the deformed samples. TMP lowered the hardenability of austenite considerably, thus lowering the hardness of the deformed samples. TMP had pronounced effects on the CCT diagrams which include: 1. γ/α transformation was raised to higher temperatures, 2. γ/α transformation nose was shifted towards faster cooling rates; and 3. γ/α transformation occurred over a wider temperature range. TMP also refined the ferrite grain size significantly. Increase in cooling rate lowered the Ar 3 significantly and also accelerated the progress of γ transformation. Increased cooling rate allowed the transformation of γ to nonequilibrium phases such as bainite and martensite and thus increased the hardness of undeformed as well as deformed samples. Increased cooling rate was found to have marginal effect on the refinement of ferrite grain size. For similar levels of other alloying elements, an increase in N b content was found to lower the Ar 3 of undeformed samples {{at a rate of about}} 10 °C/ 0. 01 % dissolved Nb. However, in deformed samples, increase in Nb content actually raised the Ar 3 temperature. This effect was considered to be due to two main reasons: firstly, the strain induced precipitation of Nb in austenite which would act as nucleation sites for phase transformation and secondly, due to the scavenging of Nb during precipitation which decreases the hardenability of austenite. Higher Nb content retarded the progress of γ transformation of undeformed as well as deformed austenite. Increase in Nb content increased the hardness of undeformed as well as deformed samples and refined ferrite grain size marginally. Nb had no significant influence on the location of phase transformation noses in the CCT diagrams. For similar levels of other alloying elements, an increase in Mn content was found to lower the Ar 3 of undeformed samples. In contrast with Nb, increased Mn content lowered the Ar 3 of deformed samples as well, suggesting that Mn is not scavenged during the strain induced precipitation of Nb and remains dissolved in the austenite which increases its hardenability. Increase in Mn content retarded the progress of transformation of undeformed as well as deformed samples. Increased Mn content increased the hardness of both undeformed and deformed samples significantly. Mn also refined ferrite grain size. Bs temperature was significantly lowered due to a higher Mn content. Increase in Mn content pushed the polygonal ferrite nose in CCT diagrams to slower cooling rates which indicates increased hardenability of austenite and thus counters the effect of TMP which decreases the hardenability...|$|E
