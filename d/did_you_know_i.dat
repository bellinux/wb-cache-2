2500|$|Darling died of {{lymphoma}} on March 21, 1974, aged 29, at the Columbia University Medical Center {{division of}} the Cabrini Health Center. In a letter written on her deathbed and intended for Andy Warhol and his followers, Darling said, [...] "Unfortunately before my death I had no desire left for life... I am just so bored by everything. You might say bored to death. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> couldn't last. I always knew it. I wish I could meet you all again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' {{answered}} the husband, 'beastly awkward {{not being a}} good swimmer. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> had fallen in? You met my wife, I suppose?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Captain Putnam, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> let {{somebody}} in? I--that is--I mean, who said I let anybody in?" [...] stammered poor Smith, taken completely off his guard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{have heard}} that story before; yes, from the {{excellent}} Martin himself--and, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> don't quite believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{really feel}} like that? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> am not pretending to feel like {{that as part of}} a carefully-prepared plan?' ...|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON [quivering] Oh, <b>dont.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were here.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} it perfectly," [...] she declared. [...] "It was last Whit-Monday. Hateful people they were, all of them. But how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> saw nobody else pass by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have had}} {{visitors}} who were quite opposed!" [...] Verena announced, as if such news {{could not possibly}} alarm her. Then she added, [...] "How then <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was out here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought that}} this style of {{conversation}} might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, {{any more than it}} was to me, so I joined in, [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> wanted to marry anyone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, my dear fellow," [...] I said sleepily, [...] "but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> thought I was in London--in fact, I could {{swear that}} I have been there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! not at all. By-the-bye, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was {{surprised}} yesterday at finding that Ferdinand and Henrietta were such old acquaintances.' ...|$|R
60|$|COMTESSE. Oh, it {{is quite}} my {{conception}} of your character. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> am rather sorry for this Mr. John Shand.|$|R
6000|$|... "How the dickens <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{was down}} there?" [...] Francis demanded, with some surprise. [...] "I was just {{thinking}} as I drove up that I hadn't left my address either here or at Clarges Street." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sammy didn't {{look the}} least bit put out. [...] "Because I like eggs," [...] he replied promptly. [...] "If people will leave their eggs {{unguarded}} they must expect to lose them. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> took those eggs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was here?' inquired Mary. 'Who {{could have}} told you that I took another service at Ipswich, and that they {{afterwards}} moved all the way here? Who COULD have told you that, Mr. Weller?' ...|$|E
60|$|GEOFFREY Well, {{it sounds}} perhaps inhospitable, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> really think I should {{ask you to}} take it away again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{was present}} {{when you talked}} the matter over with that fellow--what's-'is-name--that gave you his report." ...|$|R
6000|$|PURDIE (with a disarming {{smile for}} the absent DEARTH). <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> believe he is. Do the ladies like our proposal, Coade? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> had it? If it hadn't {{been for}} her, I shouldn't have brought any. She {{put it into}} my pocket just as I was leaving. She said you would all {{want to see what}} she looked like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘And {{that brings}} {{me back to}} what you will admit is a most natural inquiry,’ said I. ‘To what do I owe the {{pleasure}} of this visit? how did you recognise me? and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was here?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} here?' Her voice was now not only quiet but sweet. Without thinking, Harold blundered on. His {{intention}} was so single-minded, and his ignorance of woman so complete, {{that he did}} not recognise even elementary truths: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible. You {{must not}} move that knight: it exposes your king. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> {{think there is}} a great charm about this house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what {{nice things}} <b>you</b> say! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> always admired your {{compliments}}? I think they're the most charming compliments in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By George! she's a {{wonderful}} woman. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can't help {{thinking of her}} at night? She keeps me awake-she does, upon my honor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that brings}} {{me back to}} what you will admit is a most natural inquiry," [...] said I. [...] "To what do I owe the {{pleasure}} of this visit? how did you recognise me? and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did {{you think}} I loved you? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> did not? Did you ever care, Man! for my heart, or propose to {{yourself}} {{to win the}} worthless thing? Was there any poor pretence of any in our bargain? Upon your side, or on mine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{call it a}} very {{promising}} Bhaer-garden, and I'm {{proud to be a}} member of it. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was the head boy in this school?" [...] he asked, turning to Dan, and changing the subject skilfully, for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} thought, 'He's gone. He's gone.' Sometimes, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> have felt quite angry with him. Why need he have gone--so soon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, George! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> don't think I should {{much like}} {{going back to}} Virginia?" [...] says Harry, in a low, alarmed voice.|$|R
60|$|SMITH. [Rising also.] I am at your service. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> rather guessed <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} here only to protest against my {{precious}} public-house.|$|R
6000|$|At {{about the}} same time the Lizard entered Feinheimer's. In {{the far corner of the}} room Murray was seated at a table. The Lizard {{approached}} and sat down opposite him. [...] "Here I am," [...] he said. [...] "What do you want, and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> was in town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I! Oh, dear no! I {{have tried}} strenuously {{to make up}} a Limerick for a competition, but in vain. So you see, I am a failure there. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> have a son, though?—a marvellous little fellow, is he not, Leslie?—he is my work. I am a {{wonderful}} mother, am I not, Leslie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, my love, that's a joke; as if I hadn't {{heard you}} {{say the same thing}} twenty times. You've complained of having to go up there much more bitterly than I ever <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> like your sister, and, in his way, Gazebee is a very good fellow; but after three or four hours, one begins to have had enough of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Spanish place? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} slept into to-morrow, have I? That Robin has not flown to Wrapworth and back since three o'clock?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> {{have also}} the most curious sensations in my mouth--almost as if--it's so absurd!--as if I wanted to stuff things into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's {{talk about}} the weather," [...] murmured Andy, who had passed to the window. [...] "Say, fellows, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> think it's going to snow!" ...|$|R
