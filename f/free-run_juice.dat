2500|$|For {{as long as}} presses {{have been}} used, winemakers {{have been aware of}} the {{different}} color, body and aroma characteristics of wine made from the [...] "free-run" [...] juice compared to pressed <b>juice.</b> <b>Free-run</b> is the <b>juice</b> that has been extracted through the process of crushing, the natural break down of the grape cell walls during maceration and fermentation and by the own weight of the grape berries as they are loaded {{on top of each other}} in a press. Even among press juice there are compositional difference between the various [...] "fractions" [...] of juice produced from initial pressing through subsequent (and usually harsher) pressing. Often winemakers will keep <b>free-run</b> and pressed <b>juice</b> separated for most of the winemaking process including malolactic fermentation and barrel aging with the options to later blend between them to make the most complete, balanced wine, bottle separately under different labels and price tiers or to discard/sell off the pressed fractions to another producer.|$|R

25|$|The {{extent of}} these {{differences}} will be magnified or minimized based on the initial condition of the fruit after harvest (with moldy, damaged, sun-burnt or botryized grapes producing stark differences between <b>free-run</b> and pressed <b>juice),</b> the type of press used, the amount of pressure involved and the overall amount of movement that the grapes are subject to that could impact how much the skins and seeds are scoured and torn.|$|R

Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the <b>free-run</b> <b>juice,</b> can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the <b>free-run</b> <b>juice</b> depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E

25|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>free-run</b> and pressed <b>juice</b> is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins.

Other attributes may have more negative influence such as increased astringency and bitterness, precursor for browning pigments in white wine, mouthfeel and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|R

5000|$|Presses act by {{positioning}} {{the grape}} skins or whole grape clusters between a rigid surface and a movable surface and slowly decrease the volume {{between the two}} surfaces. Modern presses dictate the duration and pressure at each press cycle, usually ramping from 0 Bar to 2.0 Bar. Sometimes winemakers choose pressures which separate the streams of pressed juice, called making [...] "press cuts." [...] As the pressure increases the amount of tannin extracted from the skins into the juice increases, often rendering the pressed juice excessively tannic or harsh. Because of the location of grape juice constituents in the berry (water and acid are found primarily in the mesocarp or pulp, whereas tannins are found primarily in the exocarp, or skin, and seeds), pressed juice or wine tends to be lower in acidity with a higher pH than the <b>free-run</b> <b>juice.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of raw material, pressing, and glycosidase on the aromatic profile of goji berry wine. The free-run and the pressed juice of dried and fresh goji berries were used for wine production, whereas glycosidase was applied to wine after fermentation. Dried goji berry fermented wine exhibited much stronger fruity, floral, caramel, and herbaceous odors due {{to higher levels of}} esters, β-ionone and methionol. However, fresh berry fermented wine possessed stronger chemical notes due to higher levels of 4 -ethylphenol. Pressing treatment reduced the fruity and caramel odors in these fermented wines, and fresh berry <b>free-run</b> <b>juice</b> fermented wine exhibited the least floral aroma. Glycosidase addition did not alter the aromatic composition of wines. The principal component analysis indicated that goji raw material played a primary role in differentiating the aromatic profiles of the wines due to the difference on the content of 20 esters, nine benzenes, eight aldehydes/ketones, three acids, two alcohols and six other volatiles. The content differences on isopentyl alcohol, styrene, benzyl alcohol, 1 -octanol, (E) - 5 -decen- 1 -ol, 1 -hexanol, and β-cyclocitral resulted in the segregation of the wines with and without the pressing treatment, especially for fresh berry fermented wine...|$|E
40|$|Pages 61, 83 - 84 {{missing from}} {{original}} copyGold kiwifruit (Hort 16 A) {{is a relatively}} new entrant into the international fresh fruit market and is a controlled variety only marketed by Zespri™. Zespri™ gold and the traditional green 'Hayward' kiwifruit are mainly marketed as fresh whole fruit; however there is interest in extending the range of processed products for gold fruit to provide further opportunities to utilize the increasing volumes now becoming available. Vinegar was selected for investigation as it {{plays an important role in}} food processing as a condiment, acidulant and preservative, and has also been identified to have various health benefits. The aims of the project were: (1) To evaluate the effect of juice extraction techniques and conditions on juice yield and quality. (2) To evaluate the effects of pre-fermentation treatment and fermentation conditions on the fermentation behaviour and quality of Zespri gold kiwifruit mashes. (3) To identify suitable conditions for acetifcation of Zespri™ gold kiwifruit wines and investigate the effect of the vinegar elaboration technique on the quality of the resultant kiwifruit vinegars. Ripe peeled or unpeeled gold kiwifruit was processed in a hammer mill and the juice was extracted using a laboratory scale hydraulic press. Yield was measured for four pressurization cycles, to a maximum pressure of 250 MPa. Press aid, and pre-(cellulase) and post-pressing (pectinase) enzymes were used to improve juice yield and quality. Juice yield increased through the first three pressing cycles, but there was little gain in the fourth cycle. A juice of suitable clarity and consistency, and yield of 3. 8 L. (5 kg pulp) - 1 was obtained with the recommended process conditions of: 2 or 3 %(w/w) press aid, 0. 15 mL. kg- 1 pre-press enzyme held at 50 °C for 2 h, 0. 035 mL. kg- 1 post-press enzyme. Repeated pressing was found to increase total phenolics but reduced colour intensity in juice. The <b>free-run</b> <b>juice</b> was superior in colour and TP; other physico-chemical parameters were not affected by repeated pressing. Hand peeling and holding pomace at 30 - 50 °C for 2 - 6 h slightly reduced total acidity and significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced vitamin C. Skin contact and temperature (30 - 50 °C. 2 - 6 h) significantly (P< 0. 05) increased total phenolics. The character impacting aromatic compounds, ethyl butanoate, hexanal and trans- 2 -hexanal, were identified in the juice at 10. 8, 4. 2 and 9. 8 mg. L- 1, respectively. Proteolytic activity attributed to actinidin was about 45 % of that observed in 'Hayward' green kiwifruit juice. Alcoholic fermentation behaviour was evaluated at 20, 30 and 37 °C for natural juice and juice supplemented with sucrose to 18 °Brix using a wine yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Juices obtained from peeled and unpeeled fruit, filtered and unfiltered, were fermented. With sucrose enrichment, wines with 8. 1 %w/v or 8. 0 %w/v were obtained at efficiencies of 88 % and 87 % and productivities of 1. 3 and 1. 6 g. L- 1 h- 1 at 20 and 30 °C, respectively. Natural juice at 20 °C gave a similar yield but efficiency and productivity varied from 84 - 96 % and 1. 1 - 0. 8 g. L- 1 h- 1, respectively. Both sucrose enrichment and high fermentation temperature reduced total vitamin C and total acidity in wine. Many esters which impact positively were identified by GC-MS in the gold kiwifruit wines. These included isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, 1 -hexy hexanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl octanoate. Gold kiwifruit wines with up to 7. 5 %w/v ethanol were subjected to acetic acid fermentation using a commercial cider vinegar as the inoculum. A start up protocol for a simple semi-continuous fermentation system was developed. The best fermentation conditions identified were 29 ± 2 °C with flow rate of 0. 8 L. min- 1 of oxygen enriched (40 %) air. A yield of up to 5. 8 % w/v acetic acid was obtained at an efficiency of 85 % and productivity of 1. 2 g. L- 1 h- 1. A sensory panel described the gold kiwifruit vinegar as having stronger wine character than commercial cider vinegar, and equal to cider vinegar in terms of fruity aroma, ethyl acetate aroma and overall impression. The vinegar was found to have a meat tenderizing effect comparable to commercial papain enzyme and left the meat in good eating condition. Gold kiwifruit vinegar could find a niche market as marinating vinegar...|$|E
