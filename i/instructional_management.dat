Together, published information and survey results indicated that: (1) different instructional methods are more developmentally appropriate for different ages of learners; (2) teachers have natural preferences for particular management styles; and (3) there are distinguishing <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> styles between teachers who choose to teach at lower grade levels (PreK- 3) and those who choose to teach at upper grade levels (4 - 8). The researcher used two survey instruments to measure teachers’ <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> styles and their grade level preferences. The Chi Square analysis of grade level preferences by <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> styles was significant, indicating the proportion of teachers in the four <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> styles who preferred to teach lower elementary students differed from the proportion of teachers who preferred to teach upper elementary students. The results of the research indicated that educational leaders could use the survey instruments to predict satisfaction for teachers and effective teaching for students. Other research suggested that teachers who teach grade levels of students that generally match their natural <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> styles would likely enjoy greater job satisfaction, which, as a result, may lead to more effective teaching and longevity in the classroom.

40|$|As {{a factor}} {{contributing}} to a successful teaching career, classroom management can be affected by many latent and explicit variables. In this mixed method study, the researchers sought to scrutinize the possible connections among EFL teachers' classroom management approaches at two dimensions of behavior management and <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> and the dominant teaching style. To this end, the researchers administered the Behavior and <b>Instructional</b> <b>Management</b> Scale (BIMS) by Martin and Sass (2010) and the Teaching Style Inventory (TSI) by Grasha (1996) to 103 randomly selected EFL teachers working at private language learning centers.

Besides that, this study also investigated the challenges that teachers faced and recommended strategies for effective classroom management. This study employed a mixed-methods approach involving both quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments such as a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Since this was a case study, the total population was involved in the study. A total of 71 respondents responded to the questionnaire whilst another eight respondents were randomly selected from the total population for the interview sessions. Findings revealed {{that a majority of the}} teachers used the interactionalist style in classroom management. The same style was also used by the teachers in the <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> dimension while behavioural management dimension indicated that a majority of the teachers were interventionists. T-test analysis found that there is no significant difference in classroom management style with regards to teacher's age and training attendance. However, there was a significant difference between experienced and novice teachers with regards to <b>instructional</b> <b>management.</b> Interviews further revealed that teachers face challenges such as handling mixed age group, time management, language barrier, and children behaviour. Teachers also suggested aspects such as classroom setting, behavioural management, <b>instructional</b> <b>management</b> and training to improve classroom management.
