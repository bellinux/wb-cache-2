40|$|An {{airscrew}} windmill {{has been}} designed {{for use in the}} north east trade wind regime of the Caribbean, which is shown to be particularly favourable for agricultural irrigation purposes. The high-speed fixed-pitch airscrew incorporates the most recent aerodynamic theory and is manufactured from fibre-glass reinforced epoxy resin. To compete with conventional prime movers high efficiency, low cost and long life are maintained by the use of standard industrial and automotive transmission components. The strength of the blades and supporting structure has been confirmed by structural proof tests. Field tests, in which the windmill was connected to a standard <b>deep-well</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> for sprinkler irrigation, have been made to determine the aerodynamic integrity of the airscrew design. The detailed performance characteristics obtained over an extended operating range provide a guide for wind pumping performance prediction purposes in water resource development programmes in the Caribbean and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to better understand upstream Oil & Gas Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) reliability issues. The objective of {{this research}} is to determine how Liquid-Gas-Particulate (LGP) <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> wear differs from Liquid-Particulate (LP) <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> wear. This objective is novel because little is known about LGP wear, yet such wear is common in ESPs. To accomplish the research objective, an experimental study of a gas handling ESP was conducted. Tests of two Baker Hughes 1025 MVP G 400 Severe Duty <b>turbine</b> <b>pumps</b> were conducted with water, air, and sand. One pump was tested with a Gas Volume Fraction (GVF) of 20 % while the other was tested with a GVF of 0 %. It was found that particulates migrate radially outward through the pump and cause diffuser sidewall wear to increase through the pump. It was also found that various impeller flow path areas experience more LGP wear than LP wear. In general, pump wear progress faster for LGP wear than for LP wear. It is believed that this is caused primarily by the thinning effect that gas can have on a fluid?s viscosity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{thorough}} {{hydraulic analysis}} {{is used to}} evaluate <b>turbine</b> <b>pump</b> selection for agricultural purposes in Al-Qassim Province of Saudi Arabia. In this study, 18 real-world cases are considered. Com-plexity of irrigation systems for these cases ranges from a single tur-bine pump supplying a single sprinkler system to multiple <b>turbine</b> <b>pumps</b> supplying a complex irrigation network. For each case, the ex-isting pump in operation is evaluated; then, competitive pumps are checked for suitability for the same application. Since operational costs dominate other factors for pump selection, this study considers the pump that requires less input power as a better selection for a giv-en application. In most cases, {{it is found that}} the pump in operation is not the best pump. In addition, in most of these cases, the pump driver is found to have excessive power more than the minimum required in-put power to operate the pump...|$|R
