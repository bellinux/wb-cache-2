50|$|The {{most common}} barcode {{printers}} employ {{one of two}} different printing technologies. <b>Direct</b> thermal <b>printers</b> use a printhead to generate heat that causes a chemical reaction in specially designed paper that turns the paper black. Thermal transfer printers also use heat, but instead of reacting the paper, the heat melts a waxy or resin substance on a ribbon that runs over the label or tag material. The heat transfers ink from the ribbon to the paper. <b>Direct</b> thermal <b>printers</b> are generally less expensive, but they produce labels that can become illegible if exposed to heat, direct sunlight, or chemical vapors.|$|R
50|$|Fax {{machines}} {{from the}} 1970s to the 1990s often used <b>direct</b> thermal <b>printers</b> with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, {{but since the}} mid-1990s {{there has been a}} transition towards plain-paper faxes:- thermal transfer printers, inkjet printers and laser printers.|$|R

50|$|<b>Direct</b> thermal <b>printers</b> use heat {{sensitive}} paper (similar to thermal fax paper). Direct thermal labels tend to fade over time (typically 6 to 12 months); if exposed to heat, direct sunlight or chemical vapors, {{the life is}} shortened. Therefore, direct thermal labels are primarily used for short duration applications, such as shipping labels.|$|R

50|$|Thermal {{printing}} (or {{direct thermal}} printing) is a digital printing process which produces a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the thermal print head. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-colour <b>direct</b> thermal <b>printers</b> can print both black and an additional colour (often red) by applying heat at two different temperatures.|$|R

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{image quality}} of panoramic radiographs shown on a diagnostic computer monitor {{were compared with}} professional direct thermal prints and with common inkjet prints on different paper qualities. Indirect digital panoramic radiographs were obtained from 15 patients. The images were printed with a <b>direct</b> thermal <b>printer</b> in their original format. Afterwards, these were loaded in an imaging software programme (Microsoft Photo Editor) and assessed both on computer monitor and inkjet prints on transparency, glossy, satin and regular paper. Five observers assessed subjective image quality for different regions and anatomical landmarks on a 5 -point rating scale. Data were statistically analysed and inter- and intra-observer performances were calculated. Best image quality was obtained with direct thermal prints, followed in descending order by panoramic images viewed on the monitor, inkjet prints on transparencies, glossy paper, satin paper and finally regular paper. The differences were significant except for monitor images versus direct thermal prints, inkjet-transparencies and inkjet-glossy images and inkjet-satin versus inkjet-glossy images. The subjective image quality of indirect digital panoramic images is different for images shown on the computer monitor and for printed images depending on both the printer and paper type used. status: publishe...|$|R

6000|$|There is one point, notwithstanding, {{concerning}} {{which it}} may be well to be frank at once. The narrative of the [...] "Voyage to Cathay," [...] has been written with {{the journal of the}} Admiral before us; or, rather, with all of that journal that has been given to the world through the agency of a very incompetent and meagre editor. Nothing is plainer than the general fact that this person did not always understand his author, and in one particular circumstance he has written so obscurely, as not a little to embarrass even a novelist, whose functions naturally include an entire familiarity with the thoughts, emotions, characters, and, occasionally, with the unknown fates of the subjects of his pen. The nautical day formerly commenced at meridian, and, with all our native ingenuity and high professional prerogatives, {{we have not been able}} to discover whether the editor of the journal has adopted that mode of counting time, or whether he has condescended to use the more vulgar and irrational practice of landsmen. It is our opinion, however, that in the spirit of impartiality which becomes an historian, he has adopted both. This little peculiarity might possibly embarrass a superficial critic; but accurate critics being so very common, we feel no concern on this head, well knowing that they will be much more apt to wink at these minor inconsistencies, than to pass over an error of the press, or a comma with a broken tail. As we wish to live on good terms with this useful class of our fellow-creatures, we have <b>directed</b> the <b>printers</b> to mis-spell some eight or ten words for their convenience, and to save them from headaches, have honestly stated this principal difficulty ourselves.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the Parisian Latin book {{industry}} in the first four decades of the sixteenth century. It challenges the assumption that the Reformation brought about a profound change in the European print world. Luther’s engagement with a mass audience is believed to have led to {{an increase in the number}} of vernacular publications produced by printers throughout Europe. This was not the case in Paris. Parisian booksellers traded on their established expertise with certain genres, such as theological texts, educational books, and works by classical authors, to maximise their readership both in Paris and farther afield. Working in close proximity inspired the Parisian bookmen to unity and collaboration rather than enmity and <b>direct</b> competition. When <b>printers,</b> booksellers and publishers collaborated they were able to undertake bigger and riskier projects. Such projects might have involved testing new markets or technologies (such as Greek or music printing), or simply producing a book which required a high capital investment. The familial unity extended to the widows of printers, some of whom were able to capitalise on this and build substantial businesses of their own. This high level of collaboration and the continued focus on the established Latin market give the Parisian book world its very specific character. It also helped Paris build an international reputation for high-quality books...|$|R
6000|$|The {{inference}} of Mr. Croker {{from the}} variations must be reversed. They do not invalidate, but attest, the fidelity of Warburton, and the [...] "alterations" [...] {{in the text}} of the poems must pass unchallenged unless there is some direct proof of their inaccuracy. The arguments, on the contrary, are altogether in their favour. Four printed pages of the first Moral Essay, with the corrections in manuscript, were discovered by Mr. Kilvert among Warburton's papers. [...] "Some of the words," [...] says Mr. Croker, [...] "are so neatly written as to leave a strong impression on my eye of their being Pope's; other portions of the manuscript are more like Warburton's looser hand." [...] The faint doubt expressed by Mr. Croker would hardly have arisen if his suspicion had not been previously awakened, for the corrections are all indubitably in the handwriting of the poet. Nor was the manuscript in this instance the guide of Warburton. He followed a copy of the Moral Essays printed by Pope in his last illness, though never published. [...] "Warburton has the propriety of it as you know," [...] wrote Bolingbroke to Lord Marchmont, one of the executors; [...] "alter it he cannot by the terms of the will."[2] This of itself is an answer to Mr. Croker. The executors had access to Pope's latest printed version of the Moral Essays, which was Warburton's avowed authority, and he could not alter a single word without certain detection, and the consequent forfeiture of his legacy. He was alive to the risk. A portion of Pope's revised edition of his poetical works was passing through the press {{at the time of his}} death, and Warburton <b>directed</b> the <b>printer</b> to give the sheets, when the executors inquired for them, to their colleague the celebrated Murray, who was afterwards Lord Mansfield, adding, [...] "Pray preserve all the press copy to the least scrap."[3] The terms of the will bound the editor to be faithful to his trust, under a penalty of 4,000l., the estimated value of the bequest,[4] and he saw the necessity of having the voucher of the poet's handwriting for the minutest departure from the previous text in such of the proofs as had not received Pope's final imprimatur. A more ample guarantee could not be desired for the authenticity of the particulars in which Warburton's text differs from the printed copies superintended by Pope. All the displaced readings, which are not utterly insignificant, are preserved in the notes to the present edition, as well as numerous unpublished variations, which are taken from the manuscripts of Pope, or the transcripts of Richardson.|$|R
40|$|Micro {{scanning}} mirrors {{are quite}} versatile MEMS devices for the deflection of {{a laser beam}} or a shaped beam from another light source. The most exciting application is certainly in laser-scanned displays. Laser television, home cinema and data projectors will display the most brilliant colors exceeding even plasma, OLED and CRT. Devices for front and rear projection will have advantages in size, weight and price. These advantages {{will be even more}} important in neareye virtual displays like head-mounted displays or viewfinders in digital cameras and potentially in UMTS handsets. Optical pattern generation by scanning a modulated beam over an area can be used also {{in a number of other}} applications: laser <b>printers,</b> <b>direct</b> writing of photo resist for printed circuit boards or laser marking and with higher laser power laser ablation or material processing. Scanning a continuous laser beam over a printed pattern and analyzing the scattered reflection is the principle of barcode reading in 1 D and 2 D. This principle works also for identification of signatures, coins, bank notes, vehicles and other objects. With a focused white-light or RGB beam even full color imaging with high resolution is possible from an amazingly small device. The form factor is also very interesting for the application in endoscopes. Further applications are light curtains for intrusion control and the generation of arbitrary line patterns for triangulation. Scanning a measurement beam extends point measurements to 1 D or 2 D scans. Automotive LIDAR (laser RADAR) or scanning confocal microscopy are just two examples. Last but not least there is the field of beam steering. E. g. for alloptical fiber switches or positioning of read-/write heads in optical storage devices. The variety of possible applications also brings a variety of specifications. This publication discusses various applications and their requirements...|$|R
