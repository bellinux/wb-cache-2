25|$|The Census, {{taken on}} 27 March 2011, asked {{a number of}} {{questions}} relating to nationality and national identity, including What is your country of birth? ('Wales' was one of the options), How would you <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> national identity? (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), What is your ethnic group? ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?. In December 2012 census results revealed that 66% of residents considered themselves to have a singular Welsh national identity, with another 10% stating they had a Welsh and British identity.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Benn was {{diagnosed}} with chronic lymphatic leukaemia and given {{three or four years}} to live; at this time, he kept the news of his leukaemia from everyone except his immediate family. Benn said: [...] "When you're in parliament, you can't <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> medical condition. People immediately start wondering what your majority is and when there will be a by-election. They're very brutal." [...] This was revealed in 2002 with the release of his 1990–2001 diaries.|$|E
500|$|The 2001 UK census was criticised in Wales for not {{offering}} 'Welsh' as {{an option}} to describe respondents' national identity. Partly to address this concern, the 2011 census asked the question [...] "How would you <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> national identity?". Respondents were instructed to [...] "tick all that apply" [...] {{from a list of}} options that included Welsh. The outcome was that 57.5% of Wales' population indicated their sole national identity to be Welsh; a further 7.1% indicated it to be both Welsh and British. No Welsh national identity was indicated by 34.1%. The proportion giving their sole national identity as British was 16.9%, and another 9.4% included British with another national identity. No British national identity was indicated by 73.7%. 11.2% indicated their sole national identity as English and another 2.6% included English with another national identity.|$|E

2500|$|Marie Roberts {{wrote an}} open letter to her Amish neighbors thanking them for their forgiveness, grace, and mercy. She wrote, [...] "Your love for our family has helped to provide the healing we so desperately need. Gifts you've given have touched our hearts in a way no words can <b>describe.</b> <b>Your</b> {{compassion}} has reached beyond our family, beyond our community, and is changing our world, and for this we sincerely thank you." [...] The Amish do not normally accept charity, but because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health insurance, will likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.|$|E
