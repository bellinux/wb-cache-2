5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{childhood}} of Marco Polo until he was fifteen years old, excepting that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> spent part of his childhood in Venice. Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and an aunt and uncle raised him. He received a good education, learning mercantile subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and the handling of cargo ships; he learned little or no Latin. His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E
5|$|Augustus died in AD 14 {{at the age}} of 75. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> {{died from}} natural causes, {{although}} there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) Tiberius.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> owed the {{position}} to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, but this is not certain.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{then joined}} the revolt by Henry's sons in 1173. The attempt to {{overthrow}} Henry was unsuccessful, and in punishment the king ordered several Bigod castles, including Framlingham, to be destroyed. The king's engineer, Alnoth, destroyed the fortifications and {{filled in the}} moat at Framlingham between 1174–6 at a total cost of £16 11s 12d, although <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> shored up, rather than destroyed, the internal stone buildings.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> will not do another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E

5|$|Pausanias' account {{agrees with}} that of Herodotus (whom <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus {{declined}} to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.|$|E
5|$|S. Samyro, {{a partial}} anagram of Samy Rosenstock, {{was used by}} Tzara from his debut and {{throughout}} the early 1910s. A number of undated writings, which <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> authored as early as 1913, bear the signature Tristan Ruia, and, in summer of 1915, he was signing his pieces with the name Tristan.|$|E
5|$|Thomas' {{father was}} prosperous, wealthy {{enough to send}} Thomas to the University of Bologna in Italy. Thomas was {{recorded}} as Magister ("Master"), i.e. possessing a Master's degree, at Bologna in 1286. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> studied there alongside the aforementioned Radulf de Dundee, {{as well as one}} Michael de Dundee, whose exact family origin cannot be determined.|$|E

5|$|Whoever Cuthbert was {{prior to}} his {{election}} to Canterbury, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> owed his selection as archbishop {{to the influence of}} Æthelbald, King of Mercia. A number of Mercians were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, which suggests that Mercian authority was expanding into Kent.|$|E
5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> {{wrote the}} first draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
50|$|<b>He’s</b> <b>probably</b> {{best known}} for his feats of mentalism, but also often mixes sword swallowing, stunts, escapes, magic and his unique brand of humor in to his stage performances.|$|R

5|$|As the despot of Valona, John {{established}} commercial {{ties with}} Venice and Ragusa, {{and he became}} {{a citizen of the}} former in 1353. After the death of Dušan in 1355, he took the side of the unsuccessful Simeon Uroš in the ensuing conflict for the Serbian throne. With Venetian assistance, John maintained the essentially independent status of the Principality of Valona. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> died of the plague in 1363 and he was succeeded by Alexander Komnenos Asen, who was likely his son from his unknown first wife. John's second marriage was to the former Epirote queen-consort Anna Palaiologina.|$|E
5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{was one of}} the {{youngest}} sons of Romanos I and his wife Theodora. Theophanes Continuatus mentions him as {{the youngest}} son of the imperial couple, while the 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos mentions him as the third of four known sons. His older brothers were Christopher Lekapenos (co-emperor 921–931) and Stephen Lekapenos (co-emperor 924-945). It is unclear if Theophylact (Patriarch of Constantinople in 933–956) was his younger brother or slightly older than he was. His sisters included Helena, who married Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), and Agatha, who married Romanos Argyros. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> also had at least two unnamed sisters, known only because of their marriages to the magistroi Romanos Mosele and Romanos Saronites.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{time before}} she had made herself--when she lived {{unconscious}} of her powers. A young man from Utica, say. They usually have to wait; <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> in a store. It's a long engagement." ...|$|R
50|$|Cresconius Africanus (Crisconius) was a Latin canon lawyer, of {{uncertain}} {{date and}} place. <b>He</b> flourished, <b>probably,</b> {{in the latter}} half of the 7th century. <b>He</b> was <b>probably</b> a Christian bishop of the African Church.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so; we've been 'most {{half an hour}} {{buying the}} few things you wanted. <b>He's</b> <b>probably</b> talking to somebody. Making friends with strangers is a way he has, {{particularly}} when he knows we're waiting." ...|$|R
5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has a reverse that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's the hip-hop king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Name of Merton Ware," [...] the {{inspector}} agreed, nodding, [...] "just arrived from Jamaica. Writes {{some sort of}} stuff which the girl with him typewrites. That's his story. <b>He's</b> <b>probably</b> as harmless as a baby." ...|$|R
