5|$|Imelda, {{coming from}} a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial {{difficulties}} adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and {{said that it was}} her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers drew {{parallels}} between mainstream pop acts and Annie. Entertainment Weeklys Raymond Fiore called the album an [...] "addictive" [...] debut where Annie [...] "flaunts whispery Kylie cool and old-school-Madonna cheekiness", {{but added that}} [...] "this sugar rush of an album proves…candy is best consumed in moderation." [...] Hua Hsu of Blender magazine made a similar comparison, proclaiming Annie the [...] "Kylie Minogue hipsters don't have to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> liking". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone touted how the album [...] "comes packed with both instant surface fizz and quirky finesse that sustains repeated listenings", and ending his review, [...] "Goodbye, Britney. Hello, Annie." ...|$|E
500|$|Bornheimer {{was cast}} in the {{recurring}} role by October 2014, {{as part of the}} series [...] "stocking up on male counterparts" [...] for Carter to deal with throughout the series. In terms of costume designe, Ottobre-Melton described Krzeminski as [...] "a bit of a slob with his sport jacket, and open collar shirts." [...] After the character's death, Butters explained that Carter would <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> it moving forward, as it was her decisions that [...] "inadvertently put Krzeminski at risk". His death also affected the series in general, with Fazekas explaining, [...] "The stakes have changed now, they’ve gotten a lot more serious. The episodes that come subsequently really reflect that".|$|E

[...] Turck was a direct descendant of Dr. Paschasius Turck, a sixteenth-century Dutch physician who treated William the Silent after he received severe wounds in a 1581 assassination attempt. During his return voyage to the United States, Turck [...] "began to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> the great cost of the statue" [...] and decided to keep the purchase hidden from his wife by storing the statue in the basement of his New York City laboratory at 428 Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan.

500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on the woman {{at the center of the}} charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E
500|$|Nagy {{said it was}} {{important}} that the screenplay remained authentic to the early 1950s. [...] "There was a different protocol then, a different etiquette, a different way people related to each other physically", she said. [...] "It does you no service to spoon-feed a contemporary audience their own emotional codes and value systems." [...] While various directors and investors had input in the script throughout the long gestation period, Nagy rejected recurrent suggestions that Carol or Therese [...] "should <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> being gay and suffer some kind of breakdown scene about it." [...] "What I knew going in to the adaptation", Nagy said, [...] "was that Pat's lack of psychologizing about Carol and Therese's sexual attraction and ultimately their love, had to be maintained. It could not be corrupted by an impulse to indulge in any number of dramatic narrative cliches about guilt concerning one's sexuality or the like." ...|$|E
500|$|The town {{is shaken}} by the crime, which causes Bart to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> his actions. Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer told him. It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so. Bart then decides to return the head back where it belongs, and Homer follows along, holding himself responsible for the events. They are found by the angry mob, returning the story to the beginning.|$|E

500|$|Richards was {{surprised}} by the quality of The Age of Kings graphics, considering they were all bitmapped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of The Age of Kings as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added [...] "an amazing amount of detail to the actual game". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked [...] "why can't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?" [...] Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are [...] "so grand you'll even <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> burning them to the ground". Werner agreed; [...] "the most noticeable graphical advancements", he wrote, were [...] "the sheer size and scale of things". Game Revolution stated [...] "AOE2 is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now".|$|E
500|$|The Dragon Quest Slime has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans, {{being called the}} [...] "most prolific" [...] of all the [...] "memorable" [...] monsters from the series {{and is one of}} the most recognizable characters in gaming. The Slime has also been called cute and charming by several critics, especially when reviewing Rocket Slime. GamesRadar listed it as the most lovable blob in video games, calling them the [...] "equivalent of training wheels" [...] due to how easy they are to defeat typically, but also saying that their weird smile makes players think twice about killing them. They also listed it as a character they wished they knew less about. They stated that while they started out as nothing more than things for players to kill and not <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about,</b> the playable role of a Slime in the [...] series made them realize they were more than just generic enemies. In the January 2010 issue of Nintendo Power, the editors listed the Slime among its Favorite Punching Bags, a list including Goombas and Octoroks. They wrote that [...] "The Slimes are just so cute and friendly-looking, it's almost hard to slay them. But you know, a hero's gotta do what a hero's gotta do." ...|$|E

The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought.

[...] "If health concerns sometimes make you <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple.

And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really going to be quite shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> it, but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're back in that moment when he was dragged away from her. She really did fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{praised the}} film's humor despite its plot inconsistencies, noting that, [...] "probably because the central story doesn't quite gel, it's the loony, {{incidental}} throwaway moments that really make an impression." [...] Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun acknowledged the comic {{value of the}} film {{in spite of its}} shortcomings, saying, [...] "Yes, the story line meanders and too many scenes drone on; Knocked Up is in serious need of a good editor. But the laughs are plentiful, and it's the rare movie these days where one doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> finding the whole thing funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{boundaries}} between concepts of shame, guilt, and embarrassment {{are not easily}} delineated. According to cultural anthropologist Ruth Benedict, shame {{is a violation of}} cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values. Thus shame arises when one's 'defects' are exposed to others, and results from the negative evaluation (whether real or imagined) of others; guilt, on the other hand, comes from one's own negative evaluation of oneself, for instance, when one acts contrary to one's values or idea of one's self. (Thus, {{it might be possible to}} feel ashamed of thought or behavior that no one actually knows about [...] and conversely, to <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> actions that gain the approval of others.) ...|$|E

In OA, members changed their beliefs that [...] "it is bad to eat" [...] to [...] "one must eat to stay alive and should not <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> it"; [...] "one is simply overweight and needs to lose pounds" [...] to [...] "one has underlying psychological and interpersonal problems"; [...] "one must deprecate oneself, deprive oneself, please other people" [...] to [...] "it is okay to express positive feelings about oneself {{and take care of}} one's needs"; [...] "food is the answer to all problems, the source of solace" [...] to [...] "psychological and emotional needs should be fulfilled in relationships with people"; [...] "I am a person who eats uncontrollably" [...] to [...] "I am someone who has limitations and does not eat what is harmful for me." ...|$|E
