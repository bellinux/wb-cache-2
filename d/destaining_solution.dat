50|$|The <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> for CBB {{contains}} {{usually the}} buffer salt ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and {{a fraction of}} 30%-50% organic solvent (mostly acetonitrile). The hydrophobic interactions between protein and CBB are reduced by the organic fraction of the solution. At the same time, the ionic {{part of the solution}} diminishes the electrostatic bonds between the dye and the positively charged amino acids of the protein. In contrast to a mixture of water with organic solvent the effectivity of destaining is increased. An increase of temperature promotes the destaining process. To a certain degree (< 10%) the destaining procedure is accompanied with a loss of protein. Furthermore, the removal of CBB does not affect the yield of peptides in the mass spectrometric measurement.|$|E
30|$|The {{hatching}} enzyme {{was evaluated}} by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with 12  % separating and 5  % stacking gels. The molecular marker (ELPIS Bioteck Co., Taejeon, Korea) ranged from 35 to 170  kDa {{was used to}} determine the molecular weight of hatching enzyme. The electrophoresized gel was stained using 0.05  % Coomassie Blue R- 250 (Bio-Rad Lavoratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and was destained in a <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> (40  % methanol and 10  % acetic acid).|$|E
3000|$|... 1.25  µg {{samples of}} {{purified}} OmpA-Csn and Nat-Csn {{were separated by}} SDS-PAGE on 15  % gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, USA) in 50  mM borate buffer containing 10  % (v/v) methanol, pH 9. After blotting, the membrane was stained with Coomassie blue for 3  min, followed by destaining of the membrane with <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> (40  % (v/v) methanol and 10  % (v/v) acetic acid). N-terminal sequences were commercially analyzed using Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 protein sequencer (Protein Micro-Analysis Facility, Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria).|$|E
30|$|Separation {{was done}} using Mini-Protein II {{electrophoresis}} unit at 200 V, constant voltage for approximately 45 min in SDS-electrophoresis buffer. The gel was destained by incubation in several volumes of Coomassie brilliant blue <b>destain</b> <b>solution</b> {{for up to}} 8 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected as blue-stained bands against clear background.|$|R
30|$|Native {{and sodium}} dodecyl {{sulphate}} (SDS)-PAGE was performed with 4 % stacking and 10 % resolving gel using vertical gel electrophoresis system (GeNei, Bangalore, India). Silver staining was performed in native PAGE and molecular mass of the purified peroxidase was determined by calculating the relative mobility of standard protein molecular weight marker (GeNei) run alongside. In SDS PAGE, protein bands were stained with 0.1 % (w/v) coomassie brilliant blue R- 250 prepared in methanol:acetic acid:distilled water (v/v) (4 : 1 : 5) for 3  h at room temperature. The gel was further <b>destained</b> with <b>solution</b> containing methanol:acetic acid:distilled water (v/v) (4 : 1 : 5) and the bands were analyzed {{with respect to the}} standard protein molecular weight marker (Sigma).|$|R
30|$|Sodium Dodecylsulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel {{electrophoresis}} (SDS–PAGE) {{was performed}} {{according to the}} method of Laemmli (1970) using 12.5 % gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained by a solution of 0.1 % (w/v) Commassie blue, 40 % (v/v) methanol and 10 % (v/v) acetic acid. The gels were <b>destained</b> by a <b>solution</b> of 40 % (v/v) methanol and 10 % (v/v) acetic acid and then gels were kept in 7 % (v/v) acetic acid. Molecular weight standards (Merck) {{were used to determine}} the molecular weight of the extracellular proteins.|$|R
30|$|After electrophoresis, {{proteins}} were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant blue (CBB) staining (R- 250 /G- 250  =  4 : 1), and destained by <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> (distilled {{water with}} 10  % ethonal and 10  % acetic acid). The images were scanned by GS- 800 ™ Calibrated Densitometer (BIO-RAD). Image {{analysis was performed}} with ImageMaster 2 D Platinum Software Version 7.0 (Amersham Biosciences). Only those with biological reproducible protein spots were considered as the specifically encoded proteins by the 1 Sl chromosome. The specifically encoded proteins were selected for further tandem MS analysis.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the destaining effects of various agents on measles-infected monolayers which were stained by the {{indirect}} method of immunofluorescence. It was found that KSCN, a chaotropic agent, gave the required destaining but was nonspecific in its action, removing antigen as well as adsorbed immunoglobulins. By using a KSCN-EDTA <b>destaining</b> <b>solution,</b> it was shown that two sequential restainings of infected monolayers were possible, which permitted the demonstration of the specificity of the observed immunofluorescence. The technique may be of particular use with clinical specimens in which relatively few cells give immunofluorescence and when the specificity of this fluorescence is questioned...|$|E
30|$|The {{prepared}} PQDs and PQD-antibody probe {{characteristics were}} assessed by 8 % {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (SDS-PAGE) [47]. In this experiment, the synthesized PQDs, monoclonal antibody, and PQD-antibody conjugation were added to specimen insertion ports, named lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. To avoid the acidic quenching effect on PQDs (the <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> contains acetic acid, based on the anterior results), after running with SDS buffer for 90  min, the gel was imaged on the Tanon 2500 gel imaging system with UV light (365  nm) in advance. To validate the coupling reaction, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue fast staining solution and washed with <b>destaining</b> <b>solution.</b> The stained gel was imaged again in white light. A comparison of the UV image with the image obtained by staining with Coomassie Blue is shown in Figure  3 e. Apparently, in lane 1, the PQDs showed a clear bond which cannot be seen in bright fields (Figure  3 e, left and right panels, lane 1). For monoclonal antibody, no signal can be detected in UV light but it is fairly visible in bright fields (Figure  3 e, left and right panel, lane 2). However, in the conjugation of PQD-antibody, the band clearly can be seen both in UV light and bright fields; both of the migration ratios in different imaging conditions are identical (Figure  3 e, left and right panels, lane 3). This result suggested that the conjugation between monoclonal antibody and PQDs is successful.|$|E
30|$|Zymogram {{analysis}} of recombinant β-mannanase {{was performed by}} a gel activity assay using LBG as substrate. Both of extracellular and intracellular recombinant fractions were run on 15 % (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the native gel was placed on a substrate gel and incubated at 50 °C for 1  h. Then, the substrate gel was stained with Congo red <b>solution,</b> <b>destained</b> with 1  M sodium chloride and background stained with 5 % acetic acid. Enzyme activity on the substrate gel was visualized as a clear zone against a blue background.|$|R
30|$|The {{cell pellets}} from 1  ml culture were {{resuspended}} in 500  μl of ice-cold breaking buffer (50  mM sodium phosphate, 1.0  mM PMSF, 1.0  mM EDTA, 5 % glycerol, pH  7.4). An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (size, 0.5  mm), vortexed for 30  seconds, then incubated on ice for 30  seconds, repeated this step {{for a total}} of 8  cycles. After centrifugation at 10000 x g for 5  min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and used for the analysis. From the above supernatant 50  μl was mixed with 50  μl 2 X gel loading dye. From this 10  μl was loaded onto 12 % SDS-PAGE and subjected to electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie blueR- 250 and <b>destained</b> using <b>solution</b> (30 : 10 : 60 of methanol, acetic acid and water) till the protein bands were apparent on a clear background. Enzyme activity was determined as per the protocol of Kamarthapu et al. (2008).|$|R
3000|$|... 100  μL {{of liquid}} was pipetted from the plum vase, desalted and {{concentrated}} to 20  μL using an ultrafiltration device. Then it was mixed directly with 5  μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} (SDS-PAGE) was performed on a continuous buffered system using a precast gel (4 – 20 %). Before electrophoresis, the sample was heated for 5  min in boiling water. 20  μL of sample {{was applied to the}} lane. After completion of an electrophoresis run at 150  V for 45  min, the gel was removed from the glass plate and stained with 0.25 % Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R- 250) for 4  h, and <b>destained</b> with aqueous <b>solution</b> containing 30 % methanol and 10 % acetic acid for 24  h.|$|R
30|$|SDS-PAGE (12.5 %) was {{performed}} by the standard methods as described by Laemmli (1970). Protein bands visualized by incubating gels with gentle shaking for 30  min in 10 % trichloroacetic acid, 4  h in Coomassie brilliant blue R 250 Coomassie blue (0.025 %) in (45 : 45 : 10 water:ethanol:acetic acid), and overnight in <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> (67 % water, 25 % ethanol, 8 % acetic acid). Modified gels {{for the detection of}} in-situ xylanase activity (zymograms) were prepared by substituting a boiled solution of birchwood xylan (0.5 %) for water during the preparation of the separating layer of the gel. Following electrophoresis, these gels were incubated for 1  h with gentle agitation in 2.5 % Triton X- 100 and then for 30  min at 80 °C in pre-heated buffer (12.5  mM bis-tris propane, pH  6.0, at 80 °C). In- situ xylanase activity was detected by staining the gels for 30  min in 0.1 % Congo red and then destaining them in 1  M NaCl. The activity gels were rinsed in a dilute acid solution (10  mM HCl) to increase the contrast between the hydrolyzed (clear) and non-hydrolyzed (black) xylan prior to photography.|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes has {{the ability}} to form biofilms on {{food-processing}} surfaces, potentially leading to food product contamination. The objective of this research was to standardize a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microtiter plate assay to compare the ability of L. monocytogenes strains to form biofilms. A total of 31 coded L. monocytogenes strains were grown in defined medium (modified Welshimer's broth) at 32 °C for 20 and 40 h in PVC microtiter plate wells. Biofilm formation was indirectly assessed by staining with 1 % crystal violet and measuring crystal violet absorbance, using <b>destaining</b> <b>solution.</b> Cellular growth rates and final cell densities did not correlate with biofilm formation, indicating that differences in biofilm formation under the same environmental conditions were not due to growth rate differences. The mean biofilm production of lineage I strains was significantly greater than that observed for lineage II and lineage III strains. The results from the standardized microtiter plate biofilm assay were also compared to biofilm formation on PVC and stainless steel as assayed by quantitative epifluorescence microscopy. Results showed similar trends for the microscopic and microtiter plate assays, indicating that the PVC microtiter plate assay {{can be used as a}} rapid, simple method to screen for differences in biofilm production between strains or growth conditions prior to performing labor-intensive microscopic analyses...|$|E
30|$|Total protein {{concentrations}} in cell lysates and supernatants were determined using a BSA standard assay (Pierce BCA Protein assay kit, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For that purpose 25  μl of diluted standard and sample (1 : 10 in PBS) {{were added to}} 200  μl of colorimetric working reagent and incubated for 30  min at 37  °C. Optical density was read at 562  nm using a microplate reader. 8 % polyacrylamide gels were co-polymerized with 1  mg/ml gelatin (Type A: from porcine skin, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Separation of 750  μg protein/lane was done under non-reducing conditions on ice. Purified MMP- 2 and proMMP- 9 (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA) were used as positive controls. Subsequent renaturing of the protein {{was carried out by}} 30  min incubation in freshly prepared 2.5  % Triton X- 100 solution followed by incubation in enzyme activation buffer (50  mM TRIS–HCl, 200  mM NaCl, 5  mM CaCl; pH 7.5) overnight at 37  °C where the buffer was exchanged after the first 30  min. Subsequently gels were washed in ddH 2 O, stained in 0.1  % Coomassie Blue solution (50  % methanol, 10  % acetic acid, 0.1  % brilliant Blue R 250 in ddH 2 O) for 2  h and destained for 20  min in <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> (10  % acetic acid; 20  % ethanol in ddH 2 O).

30|$|All the {{implements}} must be precooled at − 20  °C {{before the}} tests. The membrane protein (MP) was prepared with Bacterial Membrane Extraction Kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China) {{according to the}} instructions with minor modification. The working cultures of S. putrefaciens with different treatments at 180  min were centrifuged at 10, 000 g for 5  min at 0  °C, then washed with PBS buffer (0.1  M, pH 7.0) for two times. The extraction buffer A (500  μL, combined with 2  μL Protease inhibitor) {{was added to the}} sediments (20  mg), then put on ice for 2 – 3  h with shaking for 30  s with every 30  min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12, 000 g for 5  min at 0  °C, the supernatant was collected, and then 10  μL. Extraction buffer B was added to the supernatant, then kept at 37  °C for 10  min. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5  min at 37  °C. The under layer samples were the membrane protein (MP). MP concentration was measured with enhanced bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples may need to be diluted further to same concentration with appropriate volume of membrane protein dissolution buffer in the kit. The loaded concentration of different treatments’ MP was adjusted to 1  mg/mL. 20  μL of protein lysates was then mixed with 5  μL 5 × SDS gel-loading buffer (60  mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 14.4  mM dithiothreitol, 2 % SDS, 25 % glycerol, and 0.1 % bromphenol blue), boiled at 100  °C for 5 – 10  min before use or stored at − 20  °C until use. The loaded volume was 15  μL. Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to measure the molecular weight changes of MP, using 12 % separating gel and a 5 % stacking gel. The running buffer was 25  mM Tris- 192  mM glycin- 0.1 % SDS, pH 8.3. The power supply was settled at 80  V during the stacking of the proteins, then at 120  V.

30|$|Biofilm {{production}} was detected using microtiter plate assay, following the procedure described by O’ Toole (O’ Toole 2011). The isolates of S. epidermidis were inoculated in 10  mL of tryptic soy broth with 0.25 % glucose and incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C. Next, the cultures were diluted 1 : 100, and 200  µL of the diluted cultures, per well, were inoculated into 96 -well polystyrene microtiter plates. After 48  h incubation at 37 °C under aerobic conditions, the plates were washed three times with 300  µL distilled water. Subsequently, the plates were stained with 200  µL of 1 % crystal violet, per well, for 10  min. Excess crystal violet was removed by gently washing the plate twice with distilled water. Finally, {{a volume of}} 250  µL of 95 % ethanol solution, per well, {{was added to the}} plate and the optical density was measured at 570  nm. The absorbance of <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> was measured at 570  nm in an Elisa reader (Stat fax- 2100). A well with sterile TSB or LB served as controls, whereby their ODs were subtracted from that of the experimental strains. The mean OD 570  nm value was determined using four replicates, and was considered to be adherence positive at OD 570  nm {{greater than or equal to}} 0.300 high biofilm formation, between 0.200 and 0.299, and adherence negative at OD 570  nm less than 0.100.|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{can cause}} food borne Listeriosis, which is {{considered}} a serious public health risk. This pathogen {{has the ability to}} form biofilms on food-processing surfaces, potentially leading to food product contamination. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the occurrence of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in ham food processing plants during different production phases. And, furthermore, to examine the ability of the obtained L. monocytogenes strains to form biofilms under different circumstances. A Listeria spp. strain, a Coccus strain and 3 L. monocytogenes strains were grown as monocultures and binary cultures on polystyrene microtiter plates. All plates were made in duplicate and incubated at temperatures of 25 °C and 37 °C for 40 hours. Cell turbidity was measured at different time intervals to examine differences in growth rate. Biofilm formation capacity was indirectly quantified by staining with 1 % crystal violet, and measuring the <b>destaining</b> <b>solution</b> absorbance. No correlation between cellular growth rate and biofilm formation was found. Both monocultures and binary cultures showed significantly higher biofilm formation capacity at a temperature of 25 °. This is probably due to phenotypic modifications, which are influenced by temperature. Binary cultures consisting of L. monocytogenes and a Coccus strain did not enter a stationary phase of growth after 20 hours of incubation at 37 °C. This suggests that the growth L. monocytogenes can be influenced by other non-Listeria strains. These results indicate that Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes are present in ham processing plants and able to form biofilms. The biofilm formation capacity is influenced by culture composition and temperature. To increase the validity of these results, more plants should be sampled. For founded statements about a health risk regarding the obtained L. monocytogenes strains, the presence of virulence factors should be examined by multiplex PCR...|$|E
