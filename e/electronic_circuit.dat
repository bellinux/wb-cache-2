5|$|A voltage doubler is an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> which charges {{capacitors}} {{from the}} input voltage and switches these charges {{in such a}} way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice the voltage is produced at the output as at its input.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Transient {{simulation}} of power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> is of considerable {{interest to the}} designer. The switching nature of the devices used permits development of specialized algorithms which allow a considerable reduction in simulation time compared to general purpose simulation algorithms. This paper describes a method used to simulate a power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> using the SIMULINK toolbox within MATLAB software. Theoretical results are presented provides the basis of transient analysis of a power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Keywords—Modelling, Simulation. I...|$|R
30|$|DC/DC {{converters}} are power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> used {{to change}} the magnitude of DC voltages, often providing a regulated output voltage. Boost, buck and boost-buck converters are three commonly used converters applied in a power <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> In this paper, a buck converter is employed.|$|R

25|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} may be {{a problem}} in circuits where very small currents are used in the function of an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit,</b> such as long-time-constant integrators or sample-and-hold circuits. In most electrolytic capacitor applications supporting power supply lines, dielectric absorption is not a problem.|$|E
25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires {{that need to be}} removed before they are used.|$|E
25|$|As well, an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> can {{typically}} {{operate at}} higher frequencies than the system being simulated. This allows the simulation to run faster than real time (which could, in some instances, be hours, weeks, or longer). Experienced users of electronic analog computers {{said that they}} offered a comparatively intimate control {{and understanding of the}} problem, relative to digital simulations.|$|E

40|$|A unified {{technique}} for mathematical modelling of the input output characteristics of nonlinear <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> is presented. This technique {{can be easily}} implemented using simple hand computations without recourse to standard curve-fitting techniques, which invariably requires extensive computing facilities and well-developed software. The mathematical model, basically a sine-series function, can easily yield closed-form series expressions for the amplitudes of the output components resulting from a multisinusoidal input signal to nonlinear <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> The technique is very helpful in analysing nonlinear <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> under different scenarios of input signals...|$|R
25|$|But {{even after}} {{exceeding}} the specified limits and the capacitors having reached their “end of life” the <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is not in}} immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitors is reduced. With today's high levels of purity {{in the manufacture of}} electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.|$|E
25|$|Before printed {{circuits}} (and {{for a while}} after their invention), point-to-point construction was used. For prototypes, or small production runs, wire wrap or turret board can be more efficient. Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was John Sargrove's 1936–1947 <b>Electronic</b> <b>Circuit</b> Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a Bakelite plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.|$|E
25|$|Purely <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> {{elements}} soon replaced their {{mechanical and}} electromechanical equivalents, {{at the same}} time that digital calculation replaced analog. Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand, using circuits containing relays or valves (vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a laboratory development for measurement, analysis, design, and simulation of typical electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> using modern computer hardware and software. It shows computer measurement and {{data acquisition system}} using National Instruments (NI) LabView and NI-ELVIS, and gives methodologies for theoretical analysis and design of electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> using MathCad. It presents {{the development of a}} virtual laboratory using PSpice, and illustrates how Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and MatLab are used for data recording and/or result comparisons among measurements, theoretical calculations, and simulations. The paper shows the mechanisms and approaches developed for strong correlation between theories and hands-on experimentations using modern computer tools for the purpose of quality education of a laboratory course in electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits.</b> Index Terms – Education, laboratory, electric and <b>electronic</b> <b>circuits,</b> LabView, N...|$|R

25|$|Variable {{positive}} airway pressure (VPAP) (also {{known as}} bilevel (BiPAP or BPAP)) uses an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> {{to monitor the}} patient's breathing, and provides two different pressures, a higher one during inhalation and a lower pressure during exhalation. This system is more expensive, and is sometimes used with patients who have other coexisting respiratory problems and/or who find breathing out against an increased pressure to be uncomfortable or disruptive to their sleep.|$|E
25|$|More complex {{electronic}} ballasts use programmed start. The {{output frequency}} is started above the resonance {{frequency of the}} output circuit of the ballast; and after the filaments are heated, the frequency is rapidly decreased. If the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the ballast, the output voltage will increase {{so much that the}} lamp will ignite. If the lamp does not ignite, an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> stops the operation of the ballast.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E

25|$|The {{sensitive}} transducer {{element of}} a microphone is called its element or capsule. Sound is first converted to mechanical motion {{by means of a}} diaphragm, the motion of which is then converted to an electrical signal. A complete microphone also includes a housing, some means of bringing the signal from the element to other equipment, and often an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> to adapt the output of the capsule to the equipment being driven. A wireless microphone contains a radio transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the capacitor's {{lifetime}} {{degradation failure}} begins to appear. At the same time the range of the constant failure rate ends. But even after exceeding the capacitor's specified end of life the <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> is not in immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitor is reduced. With today's high levels of purity in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.|$|E
25|$|Very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) is {{the process}} of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.|$|E

25|$|The {{reliability}} prediction of aluminum electrolytic capacitors is generally {{expressed as a}} Failure rate λ, abbreviated FIT (Failures In Time). It {{is a measure of}} the number of failures per unit hour during the time of constant random failures in the bathtub curve. The flat part in the bathtub curve corresponds with the calculated lifetime or service life of non-solid electrolytic capacitors. The failure rate is used to calculate a survival probability for a desired lifetime of an <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> in combination with other participating components.|$|E
25|$|Microelectronics {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design and microfabrication of very small <b>electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices {{are already in the}} nanometer regime, with below 100nm processing having been standard since about 2002.|$|E

Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine.
