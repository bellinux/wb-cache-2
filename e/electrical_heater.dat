50|$|Heaters {{exist for}} {{various types of}} fuel, {{including}} solid fuels, liquids, and gases.

50|$|A {{convection}} heater is a heater which operates by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A {{convection heater}} may have an <b>electrical</b> <b>heater</b> element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|E

50|$|A {{self-regulating}} heater is an <b>electrical</b> <b>heater</b> which strives {{to keep a}} constant temperature regardless of how the ambient conditions changes. It is the material in the heater itself that regulates the temperature. The heater requires no regulating electronics, temperature sensors, overheat protection etc. The temperature the heater will hold is decided when the material and the heater is produced. It can be fine tuned by changing the voltage to the heater. Self-regulating heaters are made from materials with strong Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) characteristics, i.e. the resistivity of the material increases rapidly with increasing temperature. Such materials include ceramic PTC stones. and PTC rubber.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the 'heat flow' technique is called 'power compensation' calorimetry. This method uses a cooling jacket operating at constant flow and temperature. The process temperature is regulated by adjusting {{the power of the}} <b>electrical</b> <b>heater.</b> When the experiment is started, the electrical heat and the cooling power (of the cooling jacket) are in balance. As the process heat load changes, the electrical power is varied {{in order to maintain the}} desired process temperature. The heat liberated or absorbed by the process is determined from the difference between the initial electrical power and the demand for electrical power at the time of measurement. The power compensation method is easier to set up than heat flow calorimetry but it suffers from the similar limitations since any change in product composition, liquid level, process temperature, agitation rate or viscosity will upset the calibration. The presence of an electrical heating element is also undesirable for process operations. The method is further limited by the fact that the largest heat it can measure is equal to the initial electrical power applied to the heater.|$|E
5000|$|Egg waffles {{are made}} from a sweet, egg-rich batter that is cooked on a hot griddle, a special frying pan with small round cells (resembling an æbleskiver pan but with a higher number of smaller round cells). The griddle is set on hot coals in the fire, or more {{commonly}} on an <b>electrical</b> <b>heater.</b> The batter is poured over the special frying pan and heated; the small ovals of egg waffles are thus formed. The crucial key to prepare a crispy egg waffle is {{to turn over the}} pan quickly after the batter is poured into the hot frying pan. This could create an egg waffle that is crispy on top, and cake-like on the bottom. In addition to the conventional [...] "egg taste", they are also available in a variety of flavours such as chocolate, green-tea, ginger, etc. Most batters used in egg waffle are quick breads, although some are also made using a yeast-raised or fermented batter. Egg waffles can be eaten at different times of the day, depending on local tradition.|$|E
50|$|Early freezer units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the freezer were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the freezer compartment (Freezer Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an <b>electrical</b> <b>heater</b> wire that heated the freezer's walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured freezer compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal freezer door; units featuring an entirely separate freezer compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older freezer compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|E
