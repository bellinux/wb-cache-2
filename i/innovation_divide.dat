40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{synthesis}} of two Schumpeterian views: that growth is driven by innovation, and {{that the level of}} financial market development affects the growth process. We adopt an endogenous growth model where growth is driven by R&D activities of entrepreneurs.

The extent of financial market development is defined as the number of high ability agents in the financial market. Having a more developed financial market facilitates the allocatin of resources to the innovation sector, at the same time reduces the number of entrepreneurs available to the innovation sector. We characterize equilibrium in the financial market, and find that market allocation of entrepreneurs only coincides with the growth maximising allocation when all value created by <b>innovation</b> are <b>divided</b> by entrepreneurs, otherwise the market allocation is typically not growth maximising, and low grow trap may exist.

Comparison is made between stumpage price change and inflation {{as well as between}} forests and other assets, which are housing, offices, stocks and their subclass forest industry stocks as well as bonds and debentures. These results are based on a complete count of the stumpage prices, silvicultural costs, felling volumes and national forest inventory (NFI) data. Forest ownership produced a real return of only 2. 6 % in the 1972 – 2003 period, housing 4. 6 % and forest industry stocks as much as 7. 6 %. The nominal return on forest ownership of 8. 4 % consist-ed of stumpage price change rate 4. 6 %, commercial fellings 3. 1 %, costs – 0. 35 %, and volume change component 1. 0 %. Surprisingly, stumpage price change did not exceed the inflation level of 5. 8 %. The correlation with forest ownership was statistically significant only with private housing. Competi-tiveness benchmarking places forests slightly behind housing. However, optimal portfolios, which also recognise correlations, place housing behind forests. In all, financial investments clearly outperformed real investments in the low inflation 1987 – 2003 period.

First, it identifies the various components which contribute {{to the creation of the}} identity of the knowledge and <b>innovation</b> city, <b>dividing</b> them into two categories: “structural components” (such as the presence of research centres, skilled human resources, high technology companies, etc.), which are considered as essential requisites, and “contextual components” (both tangible and intangible), which not only strengthen structural ones, but also help to define the typical features and the "signs" of the knowledge and innovation city. Secondly, the paper analyzes the relationship between the construction of an image that represents the knowledge and innovation city and the perception of this image by internal and external actors. Adopting this theoretical background, the case of Pisa is then presented, since it describes a medium sized university city, with a “lights and shadows” situation – linked to the presence of at least another other strong urban image, such as being the "City of the Leaning Tower" – which aims at recognizing and communicating itself as an urban centre that grounds its development on scientific knowledge and technological innovation...|$|R

For example, that the problem found in the process design should be solved in conceptual design is that kind of problem.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how cooperatives affected and {{were affected by}} the profound political, economic and social transitions {{that have occurred in}} Nicaragua in recent decades. It pays particular attention to the shift from the post-revolutionary Sandinista regime of the 1980 s to the "neoliberal" regime of the 1990 s and early 2000 s. In the early 1990 s, a peace accord ended years of civil war and the Sandinista government was voted out of office by a coalition of Centrist and Right-wing parties. This meant that policies supporting state and cooperative forms of production were replaced by those favouring privatization, the rolling back {{of the state and the}} freeing up of market forces. Cooperatives and the agrarian reform process initiated by the Sandinista government were heavily impacted by this process, often in contradictory ways. Land redistribution to landless peasant farmers and cooperative organizations continued as part of the process of peace-building prior to the elections. Demobilized military and other security personnel were given land after the elections. Workers in state-owned farms and agro-industrial enterprises also acquired assets when part of the state sector was converted to worker-owned and managed enterprises. But the neoliberal era ushered in a process of decollectivization and dispossession and heavily constrained access to credit and support services for cooperatives and small-scale farmers. Agricultural workers and producers were not passive bystanders in this process. Their responses conformed to a Polanyian-type "double movement" where societal forces mobilize in myriad ways to protect against the negative social effects of economic liberalization and the dominance of market forces. The pro-market strand of the double movement centred not only on economic liberalization but also an agrarian counter-reform centred on decollectivization and returning lands to former owners. The societal reaction or "protective" strand of the double movement consisted of diverse forms of contestation, collective action and social <b>innovation.</b> <b>Divided</b> in three parts, this paper first outlines the rapid rise of the cooperative sector and its strengths and weaknesses during the post-revolutionary period from 1979 to the electoral defeat of the Sandinistas in 1990. Part 2 examines the uneven trajectory of agrarian reform and cooperative development during the neoliberal 1990 s, consisting of counter reform and ongoing redistribution to the landless. Part 3 examines four manifestations of the "double movement" by agricultural workers and producers. They include (i) the proliferation of civil and armed resistance in the early 1990 s; (ii) the structuring of a cooperative movement; (iii) efforts to empower small coffee producers via the fair trade movement and the "quality revolution" and (iv) the drive to reactivate the smallholdings of poor rural women and organize them in pre-cooperative groups. A concluding section distils the main findings for the addressing the challenge of post-conflict reconciliation and development, and refers briefly to the implications for the cooperative movement of the return to power of the Sandinista National Liberation Front in 2007. The main policy lesson for governments engaged in processes of peace-building and "post-conflict" reconstruction would seem to be: ignore the issue of inclusive agrarian development at your peril! If a disabling policy environment exists, and if demands for land and employment on the part of subaltern groups are not met, various forms of resistance will ensue, with the possibility of renewed violent conflict and the inability to govern effectively. And when a political party seemingly supportive of the cooperative sector regains the reins of power, renewed support may come at the cost of dependency and loss of autonomy of the cooperative movement...|$|R
