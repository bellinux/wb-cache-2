40|$|ABSTRACT: Induction of {{metallothionein}} synthesis in {{the presence}} or absence of Interleukin  6 (IL- 6) was one of the responses examined to identify the mechanism by which IL- 6 (at high concentration) was able to reverse cadmium inhibition of B 9 cell line proliferation. Cellular metallothionein was assayed by Cd-haem method. The results revealed a Cd-induced increase in cellular metallothionein synthesis. IL- 6 alone was not sufficient to induce expression of metallothionein in this cell line. The Kinetics of B 9 cells <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> (using radio active 109 Cd as tracer) was another response examined. Cells were pre-loaded with 109 Cd then transferred to 109 Cd-free medium containing IL- 6. The results show the efflux of Cd from IL- 6 stimulated B 9 cells, which suggest that there is no functional linkage between IL- 6 stimulation and cellular handling of Cd. The efflux of cadmium out of the cells is however an important observation in that many function assays used in immunotoxicology are carried out in-vitro after cellular exposure to the chemical in-vivo. In the interpretation of such data, the ability of the cells to recover as a result of cellular efflux of the chemical should always be considered. @JASE...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with exposure of stone loach (Noemacheilus barbatulus L.), a fairly common fish in British rivers, to cadmium and lead. The work described in this thesis was performed to assess {{the relative importance of}} different routes of entry (water, food and sediment) on the body burden of cadmium and lead in stone loach under field conditions. These studies were {{based on the premise that}} metabolic rate of stone loach is an important factor affecting metal burden. Metabolic rate in fish is dependant on factors which include body weight, temperature, and physiological condition. Therefore, a wide weight range of fish was deliberately used in this study, to obtain information on the effect of body weight, in contrast to common practice in laboratory studies where uniformity of body weight is used to reduce the variation in effect on uptake of pollutants. This thesis is divided into the following parts:- introduction (part I);- laboratory studies (part II);- field studies (part III);- mathematical modelling (part IV);Part I of this thesis describes where lead and cadmium are present in the environment and the effect of human activities on distribution of the metals. This distribution was studied in areas in Derbyshire (UK), where one site (the River Ecclesbourne with mineral veins at the head of the valley), had higher metal levels in sediment and water than two other sites (both with 'background' levels of metals). In general, uptake of cadmium and lead by fish may occur via three pathways, but there is no consensus over their relative importance, not even within one species used in different studies. The literature is reviewed on environmental fate and effects on organisms of cadmium and lead. (chapter 1). Part II (laboratory experiments) describes the laboratory experiments which were aimed at obtaining quantitative information on rates of uptake and loss of cadmium from three possible sources. Chapter 2 reports exposure to water-borne cadmium by the stone loach at different temperatures and over a range of cadmium concentrations. Rates of uptake and loss of cadmium were found to be affected by size of the fish and to increase with temperature. There was some evidence that cadmium burden of the loach reached a maximum after exposure around 16 °C. Fed fish appeared to have a higher rate of cadmium uptake from the water than had starved fish. Published rates of loss after exposure to cadmium cannot be readily compared because duration of exposure may affect rates at which a fish gets rid of cadmium. Metabolic rate was estimated by the oxygen consumption rate. Two levels were distinguished: a low 'routine' level, when the fish were at rest during light, and a higher 'active' level, when fish were swimming, which was observed for a few hours after the onset of darkness. The difference between these two levels narrowed towards the upper end of the temperature range used (6 - 18 °C), suggesting that loach became stressed at high temperatures. A similar effect of temperature on rate of cadmium uptake from Tubifex, used as food items, into fish was found. Absorption efficiency of cadmium from food by the loach decreased with increasing cadmium concentration in the food; also, in spite of increased food consumption at higher temperatures, cadmium burden of stone loach did not rise in proportion because of reduced absorption efficiency of the metal. (chapter 3). Exposure of stone loach to sediment with levels of cadmium and lead higher than 'background' increased body burdens of both metals (chapter 4). High rates of loss resulted in the rapid development of a steady state. The biological half-life for cadmium was longer than for lead in these experiments. The field studies (part III) were carried out to provide information on the growth rate of stone loach, fluctuations in the fishes' body burden and in concentrations of cadmium and lead in the environment (water, food and sediment) in relation to fluctuations in temperature with season. These field studies included a one-year sampling programme of stone loach in Derbyshire (UK) (chapter 5). The selected streams were the River Ecclesbourne, Brailsford Brook South and Suttonbrook. Growth rate of fish, which depended on temperature and age, was greatest during the spring and summer and was highest in young loach. Fish from all streams had reached their maximum length (about 110 mm) after two years and also their maximum cadmium burden. Differences in body size accounted for most of the variation in cadmium levels between loach of different age groups, but was less important for lead levels; cadmium burden fluctuated more than lead burden. Loach caught in the River Ecclesbourne had higher body burdens of both cadmium and lead; no significant differences were measured between the Brailsford Brook South and Suttonbrook. Water samples were taken from all three streams at four periods and on several occasions during each period (chapter 6). Most of the cadmium, in contrast to lead, was in solution. Flow rate of the water appeared to have a greater effect on the cadmium concentration than on the lead concentration. There was some evidence for seasonal fluctuations: metal concentrations were higher in the early spring than in the autumn. Kick-samples from the streams were examined for the range of invertebrate species. Remains of most of these species were found in the gut contents of loach, which suggests that loach are not very selective feeders on invertebrates. Cadmium levels in invertebrates showed seasonal variation: lowest levels were measured in samples taken during the spring and highest levels in those sampled during the autumn. (chapter 7). Sediment samples were taken at about 4 -weekly intervals from the same sites, at the same time, as the fish. Concentrations of lead and cadmium were higher in samples from the River Ecclesbourne. Although concentrations of both metals fluctuated with sampling time, there was no consistent trend at any of the sites. (chapter 7). Part IV describes the development of a mathematical model which incorporates both laboratory and field studies (chapter 7). This model predicted adequately the range of cadmium levels found in stone loach in the field. Stone loach take up cadmium from water, food and sediment. The relative importance of these sources differed between the three sites because of differences in measured concentrations. For the R. Ecclesbourne. younger fish took up relatively more cadmium from water than did older fish; the latter received relatively more cadmium from sediment. The model predicted that consistent lower temperatures caused the metal burden to be lower during the winter period and consistent higher temperatures had the opposite effect. The results of the work presented clearly show the effect of body size on metabolic rate. The model that relates body weight (W) of fish to a dependant variable (M), e. g. cadmium burden, includes an exponent (y) as follows: yM= α* WThe values of the exponent y were comparable for respiration rate, food consumption on different rations and for cadmium burden during and after dietary exposure, during exposure to sediment and in field data. However, the value obtained from water-borne studies was lower. This suggested that, for similar values of a, water was less important as a source of cadmium than food and sediment; comparison of observed cadmium burdens during exposure in the laboratory with field data confirmed this. The values of the exponent for the lead burden obtained from field data and exposure to sediment, were lower compared to the value derived from respiration studies. This suggests that uptake and loss of lead is less affected by metabolic processes than is cadmium. Body burden of lead on exposure to sediment was comparable with that in loach from the River Ecclesbourne, suggesting that most of the lead is taken up from the sediment. Cadmium burden is higher during the winter than during the summer. This is caused by the greater effect of temperature on rate of intake than on rate of loss. The relative contribution of cadmium in water, food and sediment to cadmium burden of loach depends on environmental conditions, such as cadmium concentration in these sources, temperature and body weight. There is virtually no uptake of cadmium from water during the winter; most cadmium originates at this time from food. Particles with which most of the lead is associated and which are a prime source of lead for stone loach, are brought into suspension at higher flow rates and, therefore, exposure increased. The data in this study, compared with the published literature, suggest that the fish's <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> depends on the duration of exposure; after short-term exposure, the fish eliminate cadmium rapidly while, after longterm exposure, cadmium is not easily lost. This phenomenon may be explained by the time of exposure required for the induction of cadmiumbinding proteins. There is also some evidence that the type of exposure affects the rates of loss, presumably in parallel with the fate of cadmium within the fish. Based on a one-compartment model, the cadmium derived from food seems to remain longer in the body than cadmium originating from water and sediment. There is evidence that stone loach get rid of cadmium rapidly after short term exposure to both dietary and water-borne cadmium. This corroborates the observed fluctuations of cadmium burden in stone loach from the field. The importance of different routes of uptake of both lead and cadmium differs between fish species. Water is often regarded as the sole source of metal although there is evidence that diet can contribute significantly to the body burden of fish. Bottom feeders, in particular, seem able to acquire some metal from sediment. Moreover, concentrations in the different environmental compartments determine their relative contributions to the body burden...|$|E

40|$|Cadmium {{taken up}} from lung and {{gastrointestinal}} tract is transported via blood to liver and kidney. On long-term exposure to cadmium, renal tubular dysfunction develops in humans and experimental animals. Data from animal experiments demonstrate that initially after exposure cadmium in blood {{is bound to}} albumin and proteins with higher molecular weight. Such cadmium is mainly taken up in liver. For {{a few days after}} exposure cadmium exists as metallothionein in plasma and blood cells. After both single and long-term administration <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> bound to metallothionein, cadmium is taken up by the kidney. The concentration <b>of</b> metallothionein-bound <b>cadmium</b> in plasma is quite low due to continuous renal clearance. Cadmium from metallothionein is taken up in renal tubules by pinocytosis and subsequently degraded in lysosomes, thereby releasing cadmium which stimulates de novo synthesis of metallothionein but also binds to reabsorbed metallothionein. Catabolizing and rebinding are continuous and prevent excretion <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> Because <b>of</b> differences in transport, renal metabolic <b>handling</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> are also different for different forms <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> administered and rate of administration. A single dose <b>of</b> metallothionein-bound <b>cadmium</b> given intravenously is almost immediately and completely taken up in the renal tubule. Under such conditions, resynthesis and rebinding processes are insufficient to sequester cadmium from sensitive tissue receptors, and renal damage occurs at total tissue concentrations much lower than when renal cadmium concentrations rise slowly. This explains the wide range (10 - 200 jg Cd/g wet weight) <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in the renal cortex that associated with renal tubular dysfunction in experimental animals...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the renal tubular <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> inorganic <b>cadmium</b> (Cd 2 +) by exposing primary human tubular cell cultures to physiologically relevant doses <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> chloride (CdCl 2). Furthermore, the cellular accumulation of Cd 2 + was compared to that of metallothionein- 1 -bound Cd (Cd 7 MT- 1). Finally, this study aimed to investigate the effect of the accumulation of Cd (both Cd 2 + and Cd 7 MT- 1) in renal cells on the expression of genes relevant to nephrotoxic processes. Methods: Cd concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry. mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results: Cd 2 + accumulated into human tubular cells in a concentration- and time-dependent way. Furthermore, cellular accumulation of Cd 2 + was different from the cellular accumulation of Cd 7 MT- 1, indicative for different uptake routes. Finally, mRNA expression of the genes encoding the anti-oxidative proteins metallothionein- 1 (MT- 1) and heme-oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) as well as the pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 -associated X protein (Bax) were upregulated by CdCl 2 and not by Cd 7 MT 1. Conclusion: In the presence of physiologically relevant Cd concentrations, tubular accumulation of the element in its inorganic form is different from that of Cd 7 MT- 1. Furthermore, the tubular accumulation of inorganic Cd induces mRNA expression of genes of which the protein products {{may play a role in}} Cd-associated renal toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} {{in the city of}} Christchurch (New Zealand) in order both to obtain comprehensive data describing the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in the environment, and determine factors likely to influence these concentrations. In three of the surveys - examining cadmium concentrations in air, riverwater and horse-chestnut leaves - samples were collected over long time periods. Levels <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in dust and soil, house-dust, commercial products and foods were examined in the other four surveys. Concentrations of copper, lead and zinc were also measured in many cases. Cadmium adsorption by - and mobility in - a Christchurch soil, weathering of a cadmium-containing paint and galvanized-iron, the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in samples being sequentially extracted, and speciations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in soils, road-dusts, house-dusts riverwater, and plastics were also studied. High levels <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> were found in road-dust in the immediate vicinity of some industrial operations, but concentrations in the wider Christchurch environment were generally low.

40|$|International audienceThe {{widespread}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in {{the environment}} continues to {{pose a threat to}} human health despite attempts at limiting its technological uses. The biologically significant ionic form <b>of</b> <b>cadmium,</b> Cd 2 +, binds to many bio-molecules and these interactions underlie the toxicity mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> Some <b>of</b> the molecules specialized in the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> alkaline earth (Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +) and transition metal ions (e. g. Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +/+, Fe 3 +/ 2 +) should be particularly sensitive to the presence of Cd 2 +, because they enclose cationic sites to which the toxic metal can bind. The possible molecular targets of this kind for cadmium are considered herein. Whereas in vitro evidence for native cation replacement by Cd 2 + in bio-molecules has been largely provided, the demonstration of such occurrences in vivo is scarce, with the notable exception of metallothionein. One reason might be that realistic low-level Cd 2 + contaminations involve cellular concentrations far smaller than those of endogenous cations that usually saturate their binding sites. It is very likely that cadmium toxicity is most often mediated by biological systems amplifying the signals triggered by the presence of Cd 2 +. The interference of Cd 2 + with redox sensitive systems acting at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is instrumental in such processes. A better understanding <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> toxicity to tackle the environmental challenges lying ahead thus requires properly designed studies implementing biologically relevant cadmium concentrations on different cell types, improved knowledge of the homeostasis of essential metals, and use of these data in a theoretical framework integrating all cellular aspects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> effects...|$|R

Sorption <b>of</b> <b>cadmium,</b> nickel, and strontium in the soil was quite rapid, essentially completed within two hours. Sorption isotherms for cadmium, nickel, and strontium exhibited strong nonlinearity and it was well described {{by the use of}} the Freundlich equation. The sorption <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> was greater than nickel and strontium. Electrostatic sorption was major contributor to the sorption of these metals. The breakthrough curves <b>of</b> <b>cadmium,</b> nickel, and strontium were asymmetrical and had significant tailing. The results of the simulations obtained by using models incorporating both nonlinear, and rate-limited sorption and flow-interruption experiments indicated that nonlinear sorption was the major cause of nonideal transport, with rate-limited sorption a minor component. The transport of metals was significantly affected by the presence of another metal. The transport <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and nickel was enhanced in the mixture <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and nickel due to competition for adsorption sites.

40|$|Our {{investigation}} was {{centered on a}} possible relationship between the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and changes in its chemical forms in tissues. Two models have been studied: one is the renal damage induced by a single injection of cadmium-containing metallothionein {{and the other is}} the renal damage induced by repeated injections <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> salt. Parenteral loading of cadmium-containing metallothionein caused acute and transitory necrotic damage of renal tubular lining cells. This was explained by the selective and rapid uptake of metallothionein at the proximal tubules and degradation of the protein, resulting in liberation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> ions. Cadmium ions were injected repeatedly into rats, and the changes in the chemical forms <b>of</b> <b>cadmium,</b> zinc and copper in the liver and kidneys were correlated with the histological observations.

Compared to fly ash from burning <b>of</b> straw, <b>cadmium</b> was bound more heavily, with only small amounts <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> leached. It was speciated as a form <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> oxide, cadmium silicate (CdSiO3); authors noted that adding it to agricultural or forest soils in the long-term could cause a problem with accumulation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b>|$|R

The test solutions are prepared by pressurized digestion with conc. nitric acid in a PTFE crucible. The traces <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> are determined by AAS.

40|$|A general review <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> {{concentrations}} in marine organisms and studies <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> bioaccumulation is presented. Factors which influence cadmium concentrations, such as regional differences, seasonal fluctuations and salinity, are discussed and species which {{are likely to}} accumulate cadmium identified. Experimental studies designed to investigate the influence {{of some of these}} factors on cadmium bioaccumulation in a filter feeding bivalve mollusk, the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), are presented. Field studies of seasonal dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in oysters indicate patterns which may be correlated with seasonal physiological activity. The bioaccumulation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> following input to estuarine systems by natural phenomena is observed. Cadmium {{concentrations in}} oysters collected from regions of different salinity suggest an inverse relationship between cadmium concentration and salinity. Laboratory experiments designed to investigate mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> accumulation demonstrate that an inducible cadmium binding protein, similar to metallothiomein, is present in the American oyster...|$|R
40|$|Different {{species of}} ferns (pyrrosia lingua, Lepisorus thunbergianus, Lycopodium japonicum, Elaphoglossum yoshinagae and Woodwardia japonica) were {{cultivated}} using different species <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> as cultivation solution. The {{results showed that}} there were differences in enrichment amounts <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> {{in different parts of}} plants (amounts in root>in stem>in leaves). And it was found that different species <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> could induce synthesization of plant chelated peptides (PCs) with different extents. And then PCs was coordinated with cadmium to decrease the toxicity from cadmium. There are some kinds of peptides ligands found in plants, which are mainly PC 3, iso-PC 3 (beta Ala) and iso-PC 2 (beta Ala). In the present paper, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in different parts of ferns was studied after the ferns were intimidated with different species <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> And the species of PCs-Cd coordination compounds were also investigated to explain the detoxification mechanism aroused by it...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explained}} {{the effect of}} calcium carbonate on extraction <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> from contaminated soil with different extracting agent and surfactant (0. 1 M EDTA, 1 M AA, and 1 % SDS) (single or mixed extracting agents with surfactant, SDS). The extractedCadmium was more, when 0. 1 M EDTAwas used at a pH above 5. Here, the extraction <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> from contaminated soil by 0. 1 M EDTA decreased {{with the increase of}} calcium carbonate content for soil. The extraction <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> was moderately effective, when the concentration of acetic acid (AA) was 1. 0 M. When the use of 1 % SDS alone was ineffective for extraction <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> But, the combination of 1 % SDS with 1 M AA was highly effective in the extraction <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> While, the addition 1 % SDS to 0. 1 M EDTA played only a slight role in the extraction process...|$|R
40|$|The EC-directive 91 / 338 /EWG puts {{a ban on}} cadmium {{for special}} {{applications}}. In the FRG, for all applications included in that directive cadmium is already substituted today. The substitution <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> stabilizers will be completed in the near future. The use <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> for corrosion protection has been also greatly diminished. Only the substitution <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> pigments in red and yellow "high engineering plastics" and keramic glazes cannot be realized presently. The substitution <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> for the colouring of plastics lags behind the technical feasibilities. The nickel/hydrogen accumulator, which is available now, and the lithium accumulator will probably cut back the growing consumpton rate <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> for sealed nickel/cadmium cells. There are sufficiently large capacities for the recycling of nickel/cadmium accumulators available {{but the number of}} accumulators returned is still low. Although the EC-directive 91 / 157 allows a deposit on batteries containing environmetally hazardous su bstances, its introduction is not currently planned. Cadmium polluted zinc, lead and copper and especially phosphate fertilizers are responsible for a considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> input into the environment. A threshold limit for cadmium in phosphate ferilizers for the entire EC is not to be expected in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Rats were {{injected}} intraperitoneally with {{cadmium chloride}} (5 or 10 mg/kg body weight) and calcium chloride (50 mg/kg body weight) simultaneously. Rats were killed after 2 hours. The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and calcium {{in the liver}} and kidney, and in liver and kidney mitochondria was examined. The mutual effect <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and calcium on the respiration of the mitochondria was also investigated. The results were as follows: 1) concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in the liver were lower {{in the presence of}} calcium than in its absence, but the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> was marked. 2) concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in liver mitochondria were lower in the presence of calcium than in its absence. 3) the decrease in respiratory control index and ADP/O ratio of liver mitochondria was lower in the presence of calcium than in its absence. 4) the same statements are true for kidney and kidney mitochondria. 5) The concentrations of calcium in the liver and kidney in the presence <b>of</b> both <b>cadmium</b> and calcium were similar to the those when calcium was absence...|$|R

The evaluation of the free energy <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> adsorption by the soil is a measurement of the reaction strength. This study was carried out to evaluate the free energy <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> adsorption reaction in Luvisol and Cambisol samples after addition <b>of</b> different <b>cadmium</b> level. Cadmium adsorption was considered spontaneous, since free energy was negative.

40|$|The {{fluorescent}} {{reaction of}} the reagent glyoxal-bis-(2 -hydroxyanil) (GBHA) with cadmium was studied. Based on this chelation reaction, a sensitive, rapid, direct spectrofluorimetric method for the determination <b>of</b> trace <b>cadmium</b> with GBHA has been developed. The reaction conditions for the fluorescence system <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> with GBHA were established. The cadmium ion can form a stable chelate with GBHA, having a ratio of 1 : 3 in the 12. 0 - 13. 0 pH range. The maximum excitation and emission wavelengths are 227. 4 nm and 320. 0 nm for the cadmium chelate, respectively. The fluorescence intensity <b>of</b> the <b>cadmium</b> chelate remains stable from 20 to 150 min. Under the optimal experimental conditions the fluorescence intensity is a linear function of concentration in the range 1. 0 - 10. 0 ng mL- 1 <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> and the detection limit is 0. 65 ng mL- 1 <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> Interferences <b>of</b> foreign ions were studied.

40|$|Present {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} to assess the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> in vitro for viability of hepatocytes, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, glutathione and lipid peroxidation in Channa punctatus (Bloch), a freshwater snake head fish. Three concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> as cadmium chloride (0. 1 µg/ml; 3. 0 µg/ml and 5. 0 µg/ml) besides one control has been selected. Observations reveal that except lowest concentration <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> (0. 10 µg/l), the rest two concentration (3. 0 µg/ml and 5. 0 µg/ml) exerted significant decline (P< 0. 05) in the viability of heptocytes, lactic dehydrogenase leakage and glutathione as compared to control. However, significant increase (P< 0. 05) was noticed in the lipid peroxidation in terms of MDA (Malon-di aldehyde) treated with 3. 0 µg/ml and 5. 0 µg/ml <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> chloride concentration as compared to control. Lowest concentration (1. 0 µg/ml) <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> chloride could produce no significant alteration in lipid per oxidation.

40|$|Aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{are threatened by}} environmental contaminants, and many heavy metals can influence both the structure and function of sense organs in fishes. The use of these senses {{is vital to the}} survival and reproductive success of fish and therefore affects the health of the ecosystem as a whole. The current study examines the effects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> on auditory structure and function in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). In the laboratory, fish were exposed for 96 h to a range <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> concentrations and both hearing sensitivity and hair cell morphology were quantified. While hair cell numbers were unaffected, cadmium caused an increase in auditory threshold, with a critical range for toxic effects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> estimated at 2. 1 – 2. 9 µg L− 1. Cadmium exposure also caused a decrease in response latency at higher cadmium concentrations. The current study demonstrates the sublethal effects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> on fish sensory function while also pointing to the need for more careful interpretation <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> impacts on aquatic populations...|$|R
40|$|Toxic effects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> on liver, kidney, lung, and testes {{have been}} well {{established}} in experimental animals and in cell model systems. However, {{little is known about}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> on pancreas, though the pancreas has been reported to accumulate high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>cadmium.</b> Therefore, in this study we examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>cadmium</b> on the pancreas of mice. A single sc injection of 1 mg Cd/kg to mice had no obvious toxic effects on the liver, kidney, and pancreas at both 1 and 5 days after cadmium treatment. Within the pancreas, however, the activities of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase A were significantly de-creased at 1 day after cadmium treatment, whereas the activity of carboxypeptidase B was not changed. All pancreatic enzyme ac-tivities returned to the control levels by 5 days after cadmium treatment.
