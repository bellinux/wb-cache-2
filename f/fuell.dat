40|$|Pre-flight <b>fuelling</b> {{rates in}} {{free-living}} red knots Calidris canutus, a specialized long-distance migrating shorebird species, are {{positively correlated with}} latitude and negatively with temperature. The single published hypothesis to explain these relationships is the heat load hypothesis that states that in warm climates red knots may overheat during <b>fuelling.</b> To limit endogenous heat production (measurable as basal metabolic rate BMR), birds would minimize the growth of digestive organs at a time they need. This hypothesis makes the implicit assumption that BMR is mainly driven by digestive organ size variation during pre-flight <b>fuelling.</b> To test the validity of this assumption, we fed captive knots with trout pellet food, a diet previously shown to quickly lead to atrophied digestive organs, during a <b>fuelling</b> episode. Birds were exposed to two thermal treatments (6 and 24 °C) previously shown to generate different <b>fuelling</b> rates in knots. We made two predictions. First, easily digested trout pellet food rather than hard-shelled prey removes the heat contribution of the gut and would therefore eliminate an ambient temperature effect on <b>fuelling</b> rate. Second, if digestive organs were the main contributors to variations in BMR but did not change in size during <b>fuelling,</b> we would expect no or little change in BMR in birds fed ad libitum with trout pellets. We show that cold-acclimated birds maintained higher body mass and food intake (8 and 51 %) than warm-acclimated birds. Air temperature {{had no effect on}} <b>fuelling</b> rate, timing of <b>fuelling,</b> timing of peak body mass or BMR. During <b>fuelling,</b> average body mass increased by 32 % while average BMR increased by 15 % at peak of mass and 26 % {{by the end of the}} experiment. Our results show that the small digestive organs characteristic of a trout pellet diet did not prevent BMR from increasing during premigratory <b>fuelling.</b> Our results are not consistent with the heat load hypothesis as currently formulated. ...|$|R

40|$|The natural H-mode density, i. e. {{the plasma}} density {{evolving}} in an H-mode discharge without active <b>fuelling,</b> reaches Greenwald fractions in JET typically {{higher than in}} ASDEX Upgrade.

It is shown that this limit, which would impose a lower boundary on the H-mode density, is reached in JET and ASDEX Upgrade natural density discharges, and its scaling is determined.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} detailed thermodynamics models for naturally aspirated gasoline and alternative <b>fuelled</b> to spark ignition internal combustion engines {{on the basis}} of ideal Otto cycle. A comparative study based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics are discussed here. The key parameters for analysis are considered as mean effective pressure (MEP), power, torque, exergetic efficiency, second law efficiency, and irreversibility. Air standard assumptions were taken consideration for the analyses. MEP, power output and torque for all alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines, are higher compared to that of a gasoline engine. Exergy due to heat and work are also discussed here. For heat exergy, only hydrogen exceeds gasoline while other alternative fuels have lower heat exergy than gasoline. But work (mechanical) exergy for all the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are higher than the gasoline engine. The Irreversibility or losses for the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are significantly lower than a gasoline engine. Alternative fuel engines have lower specific fuel consumption than the gasoline engine. Hence the 1 st law and second law efficiency of the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are higher compared to that of gasoline. This is also due to having a high compression ratio associated with alternative <b>fuelled</b> internal combustion engine. Exergy heat transfer of alternative <b>fuelled</b> internal combustion engine is higher due to having high heat generation during combustion...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the article is on the {{analysis}} of effective elastic properties of planar Solid Oxide <b>Fuell</b> Cell (SOFC) devices. An ideal periodic multi-layered composite (SOFC-like) reproducing the overall properties of multi-layer SOFC devices is defined. Adopting a non-local dynamic homogenization method, explicit expressions for overall elastic moduli and inertial terms of this material are derived in terms of micro-fluctuation functions. These micro-fluctuation function are then obtained solving the cell problems by means of finite element techniques. The effects of the temperature variation on overall elastic and inertial properties of the fuel cells are studied. Dispersion relations for acoustic waves in SOFC-like multilayered materials are derived as functions of the overall constants, and the results obtained by the proposed computational homogenization approach are compared with those provided by rigorous Floquet-Boch theory. Finally, {{the influence of the}} temperature and of the elastic properties variation on the Bloch spectrum is investigated...|$|E

40|$|ITER {{operations}} require effective <b>fuelling</b> of {{the core}} plasma for conditions in which neutral dynamics through the scrape-off layer is expected to significantly affect the efficiency of gas penetration. On {{the basis of the}} previous analysis for stationary conditions, pellets are foreseen to provide core <b>fuelling</b> of high-Q DT scenarios. In this paper we present a modelling study of the gas <b>fuelling</b> efficiency in ITER providing an estimate of the maximum plasma density achievable with gas <b>fuelling</b> only in various DT reference scenarios. Dynamical integrated core-edge plasma simulations for various phases of ITER DT H-mode discharges have been carried out with the JINTRAC suite of codes. Simulations of the L-mode phase show that divertor detachment sets the maximum density achievable at the separatrix by deuterium-tritium gas <b>fuelling.</b> The maximum volume-average density is achieved for 15 MA/ 5. 3 T and it is close to the requirement for stationary application of neutral beam injection heating at full power (16. 5 MW per injector) and ion energy (1 MeV) compatible with acceptable shine-through loads on the first wall. The achievable density in gas <b>fuelled</b> H-modes is typically a factor of 2 - 3 larger than in L-modes. The fusion performance of gas <b>fuelled</b> H-modes at 15 MA is typically found to be moderately high (Q ∼ 6 - 8).

Baseline tests were performed using diesel. The tests were then repeated for dimethyl ether <b>fuelling.</b> All DME tests were performed at an injection opening pressure of 210 bar, as recommended for diesel <b>fuelling.</b> The tests were all carried out at constant torque with incremental increases in speed and an improved method of measuring the DME flow rate was devised. It was found that the engine’s performance characteristics were very similar, regardless of whether the engine was <b>fuelled</b> on diesel or DME. Brake power, indicated power and cylinder pressure, during the highest loading condition of 55 Nm, were virtually identical for diesel and DME <b>fuelling,</b> with the most significant finding being that the engine was more efficient when <b>fuelled</b> on DME than when <b>fuelled</b> with diesel. Another interesting finding was that the energy release of diesel decreases with increasing load, whilst the energy release of DME increases with increasing load.
