The terminology that is employed to denote discontinuities varies depending on the theory of syntax at hand. The terms <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituent,</b> displacement, long distance dependency, unbounded dependency, and projectivity violation are largely synonymous with the term discontinuity. There are various types of discontinuities, the most prominent and widely studied of these being topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} two main {{approaches}} to the syntax and semantics of it-clefts as in ‘It was Ohno who won’: an expletive approach where the cleft pronoun is an expletive and the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic relation to the clefted constituent, and a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituent</b> approach where the cleft pronoun has a semantic content and the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic re-lation to the cleft pronoun. We argue for an analysis using Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) that captures {{the best of both}} approaches. We use Tree-Local Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar (MC-TAG) to propose a syntax of it-clefts and Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG) to define a compositional semantics on the proposed syntax. It will be shown that the distinction TAG makes between the derivation tree and the derived tree, the extended domain of locality characterizing TAG, and the di-rect syntax-semantics mapping characterizing STAG allow for a simple and straight-forward account of the syntax and semantics of it-clefts, capturing the insights and arguments of both the expletive and the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituent</b> approaches. Our analysis reduces the syntax and semantics of it-clefts to copular sentences containing definite description subjects, such as ‘The person that won is Ohno. ’ We show that this is a welcome result, as evidenced by the syntactic and semantic similarities between it-clefts and the corresponding copular sentences. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Discontinuous</b> <b>constituent</b> are a {{frequent}} problem in natural language analyses. A constituent is called discontinuous {{if it is}} interrupted by other constituents. In German they can appear with separable verb prefixes or relative clauses in the Nachfeld. They can not be captured by a context–free Chomsky grammar. A subset of hypergraph grammars are string grammars where {{the result of a}} derivation must be formed like a string i. e. terminal edges are connected to two nodes and are lined up in a row. Nonterminal edges do not have to fulfill this property. In this paper it is shown that a context–free string grammar (one hyperedge is replaced at a time) can be used to model discontinuous constituents in natural languages. 1 Discontinuous Constituents in Phrase Structure Grammars Discontinuity is a phenomenon that can be found in various natural languages. It means that two parts of a constituent of a sentences are not found next to each other in this sentence. Take for example the following sentence: 1 (1) Er hat ihm das Buch gegeben, das fleckig ist...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Discontinuous</b> <b>constituents</b> {{and free}} word order pose {{constant}} problems in natural language parsing. String generating hypergraph grammars {{have been proven}} useful for handling <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituents.</b> In this paper we describe a new notation for hypergraph productions that allows on-the-fly interconnection of graph parts with regard to user-defined constraints. These constraints handle the order of nodes within the string hypergraph. The HyperEarley parser for string generating hypergraph grammars [1] is adapted to the new formalism. A German example {{is used for the}} explanation of the new notation and algorithms. 1 Free Word Order in Natural Languages A prominent difference between natural languages lies the order of words or constituents (groups of words that belong together on a syntactic level) in the various types of sentences. E. g. declarative sentences in English have a fixed word order with the subject first, followed by the verb, the objects and finall...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the consequences of}} allowing <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituents</b> in syntactic representions and phrase-structure rules, and the resulting complications for a standard parser of phrase-structure grammar. It is argued, first, that <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituents</b> seem inevitable in a phrase-structure grammar which is acceptable from a semantic point of view. It is shown that tree-like constituent structures with discontinuities can be given a precise definition which makes them just as acceptable for syntactic representation as ordinary trees. However, the formulation of phrase-structure rules that generate such structures entails quite intricate problems. The notions. of linear precedence and adjacency are reexamined, {{and the concept of}} &quot;n-place adjacency sequence &quot; is introduced. Finally, the resulting form of phrase-structure grammar, called &quot;Discontinuous Phrase-Structure Grammar&quot; is shown to be parsable by an algorithm for context-free parsing with relatively minor adaptations.

40|$|The {{issue of}} non-configurationality is {{fundamental}} {{in determining the}} possible range of variation in Universal Grammar. This dissertation investigates this issue {{in the context of}} Warlpiri, the prototypical non-configurational language. I argue that positing a macroparameter, a single parameter that distinguishes configurational languages from non-configurational, requires variation on a magnitude not permitted by Universal Grammar. After refuting in detail previous macroparametric approaches, I propose a microparametric analysis: non-configurational languages are fully configurational and analysed through fine-grained parameters with independent motivation. I develop this approach for Warlpiri,partially on the basis of new data collected through work with Warlpiri consultants and analysis of Warlpiri texts. Beginning with A-syntax, I show that Warlpiri exhibits short-distance A-scrambling through binding and WCO data. I present an analysis of split ergativity in Warlpiri (ergative-/absolutive case-marking, nominative/accusative agreement), deriving the split from a dissociation of case and agreement, and the inherent nature of ergative case, rather than from non-configurationality. Extending the analysis to applicative constructions in Warlpiri, I identify both symmetric and asymmetric applicatives. I argue that the principled distinctions between them are explained structurally rather than lexically; therefore the applicative data provide evidence for a hierarchical verb phrase in Warlpiri. The analysis reveals the first reported distinction between unaccusative and unergative verbs in the language. (cont.) Turning to A'-syntax, I argue that word order is not free in Warlpiri; rather Warlpiri displays an articulated left peripheral structure. Thus, word order variations are largely determined by positioning of elements in ordered functional projections based on their status in the discourse. Furthermore, I present evidence from WCO and island effects that elements appear in these projections through movement. Finally, I investigate the wh-scope marking construction, arguing for an indirect dependency approach. In developing the analysis, I argue, contrary to standard assumptions, that the dependent clauses related with verbs of saying in Warlpiri are embedded rather than adjoined. On the basis of a poverty of the stimulus argument, I conclude the construction must follow from independent properties of the language. I propose that it follows from the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>constituent</b> construction, which I equate with split DPs/PPs in Germanic and Slavic languages. The syntactic structure of Warlpiri that emerges from the dissertation strongly supports a configurational analysis of the language, and thereby the microparameter approach to nonconfigurationality. by Julie Anne Legate.
