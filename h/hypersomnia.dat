25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for <b>hypersomnia</b> with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic <b>hypersomnia</b> and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies narcolepsy without cataplexy as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low orexin concentrations, including idiopathic <b>hypersomnia</b> (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: SNP rs 5770917 {{located between}} CPT 1 B and CHKB, and HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 -DQB 1 * 0602 {{haplotype}} were previously identified as susceptibility loci for narcolepsy with cataplexy. This {{study was conducted}} in order to investigate whether these genetic markers are associated with Japanese CNS <b>hypersomnias</b> (essential hypersomnia: EHS) other than narcolepsy with cataplexy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: EHS was significantly associated with SNP rs 5770917 (P(allele) = 3. 6 x 10 (- 3); OR = 1. 56; 95 % c. i. : 1. 12 - 2. 15) and HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 -DQB 1 * 0602 haplotype (P(positivity) = 9. 2 x 10 (- 11); OR = 3. 97; 95 % c. i. : 2. 55 - 6. 19). No interaction between the two markers (SNP rs 5770917 and HLA-DRB 1 * 1501 -DQB 1 * 0602 haplotype) was observed in EHS. CONCLUSION: CPT 1 B, CHKB and HLA are candidates for susceptibility to CNS <b>hypersomnias</b> (EHS), as well as narcolepsy with cataplexy...|$|R
25|$|Pharmacology is {{necessary}} for some conditions. Medication may be useful for acute insomnia and {{for some of the}} parasomnias. It is almost always needed, along with scheduled short naps and close follow-up, in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic <b>hypersomnia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially, KLS appears {{similar to}} bipolar depression. Patients with frontal-lobe {{syndrome}}s and Klüver-Bucy syndrome also display similar symptoms, but these conditions can be differentiated {{by the presence}} of brain lesions. KLS should also be distinguished from very rare cases of menstruation-caused <b>hypersomnia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic {{criteria}} for KLS {{was established by}} Schmidt in 1990, and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders further refined them. KLS is classified as a sleep disorder, specifically one of recurrent <b>hypersomnia.</b> Before 2005, hyperphagia and hypersexuality were thought to occur in all cases. That was changed with the guidelines published that year, which noted {{that they did not}} always occur.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has been accumulating that the sleep of individuals with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) is not only disrupt- ed in a nonspecific way but that ADHD has an increased association with simple sleep related movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movements in sleep (RLS/PLMS), rhythmic movement disorder (body rocking and head banging), and parasom- nias, such as disorders of partial arousal (sleep walking, sleep ter- rors, and confusional arousals). In addition increased associations have been reported between ADHD and <b>hypersomnias</b> such as nar- colepsy and sleep apnea as well as circadian rhythm disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome. These relationships are reviewed and the implications for such associations are explored. Patients with sleep disorders should be queried about the symptoms of ADHD and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|Measurement {{of sleep}} {{microarchitecture}} and neural oscillations is an increasingly popular technique for quantifying EEG sleep activity. Many {{studies have examined}} sleep spindle oscillations in sleep-disordered adults; however reviews of this literature are scarce. As such, our overarching aim was to critically review experimental studies examining sleep spindle activity between adults with and without different sleep disorders. Articles were obtained using a systematic methodology with a priori criteria. Thirty-seven studies meeting final inclusion criteria were reviewed, with studies grouped across three categories: insomnia, <b>hypersomnias,</b> and sleep-related movement disorders (including parasomnias). Studies of patients with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing were more abundant relative to other diagnoses. All studies were cross-sectional. Studies were largely inconsistent regarding spindle activity differences between clinical and nonclinical groups, with some reporting greater or less activity, while many others reported no group differences. Stark inconsistencies in sample characteristics (e. g., age range and diagnostic criteria) and methods of analysis (e. g., spindle bandwidth selection, visual detection versus digital filtering, absolute versus relative spectral power, and NREM 2 versus NREM 3) suggest a need for greater use of event-based detection methods and increased research standardization. Hypotheses regarding the clinical and empirical implications of these findings, and suggestions for potential future studies, are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} functional differentiation was {{a division}} of caudal and rostral, this was based upon the observation that the lesioning of the rostral reticular formation induces a <b>hypersomnia</b> in the cat brain. In contrast, lesioning of the more caudal portion of the reticular formation produces insomnia in cats. This study {{has led to the}} idea that the caudal portion inhibits the rostral portion of the reticular formation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation concerns the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine. An imbalance in the neurotransmitter pathways of these chemicals {{could play a}} role. Viral infections have also been suggested as a possible cause. Evidence for their role includes lesions found in autopsies. CSF samples from KLS patients indicate that the condition has a different cause than influenza-associated encephalopathy. Triggers of KLS may also affect the blood-brain barrier, which could {{play a role in}} the condition. There is limited evidence of what role hypocretin may play, although it often influences <b>hypersomnia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kleine–Levin {{syndrome}} (KLS), {{also known}} as Sleeping Beauty syndrome, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by persistent episodic <b>hypersomnia</b> and cognitive or mood changes. Many patients also experience hyperphagia, hypersexuality and other symptoms. Patients generally experience recurrent episodes of the condition {{for more than a}} decade and may return at a later age. Individual episodes generally last more than a week. Some times lasting for months. The condition greatly affects the personal, professional, and social lives of sufferers. The severity of symptoms and the course of the syndrome vary between sufferers. Patients commonly have about 20 episodes over about a decade. Several months generally elapse between episodes. The onset of the condition usually follows a viral infection; several different viruses have been observed to trigger KLS. It is generally only diagnosed after similar conditions have been excluded; MRI, CT scans, lumbar puncture, and toxicology tests are used to rule out other possibilities. The syndrome's mechanism is not known, but the thalamus is thought to possibly play a role. Tomography has shown hypoperfusion in the brains of patients during episodes.|$|E
40|$|Background Parasomnias are {{undesirable}} events {{occurring in}} the sleep-wake transition period. Several predisposing factors are reported to induce parasomnia in preschool children. Objective To es timate the magnitude of parasomnia in school children and to evaluate its relationship with possible predisposing factors. Methods Five hundred children aged 5 - 16 years from a boys' school and a girls' school in Khulna City, Ban gladesh, were randomly selected for the study conducted fromJuly to December 2011. The survey was don e in two steps: self-administered questionnaire and clinical interviews of affected students and their parents. Apart from demographic features, questionnaires included details of perinatal and personal fac tors as well as familial and socioeconomic factors. The diagnoses of variants of parasomnias {{was based on the}} criteria for category-based classification by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results Seven hundred thir teen filled questionnaires revealed parasomnia in 187 (26. 2 %) children. Most parasomnias were accompanied by other sleep disorders, in which 23 (12. 3 %) having primary dyssomnias including 18 (9. 3 %) obstructive sleep apnea, and 10 (5. 3 %) parasomnias with <b>hypersomnias.</b> Nightmares (7. 4 %) were highest among the parasomnias fo llowed by nocturnal enuresis (4. 1 %) and sleep terrors (3. 4 %). More girls experienced parasomnias than boys (107 / 360 vs. 80 / 353, respectively; P= 0. 039). Perinatal factors such as problems during pregnancy (17. 1 %) or eventful delivery (25. 7 %), and socioeconomic factors such as familial disharmony (11. 8 %) and low socioeconomiclevel (3 1. 6 %) had positive associations with parasomnia. Conclusion One-quarter of school children experience parasomnia. We found perinatal factors particularly problem during pregnancy, and socioeconomic factors particularly familial disharmony have significant influences on this condition...|$|R
40|$|The hypocretin/orexin neuropeptides (hcrt) are {{key players}} in the control of sleep and {{wakefulness}} evidenced by the fact that lack of hcrt leads to the sleep disorder Narcolepsy Type 1. Sleep disturbances are common in mood disorders, and hcrt has been suggested to be poorly regulated in depressed subjects. To study seasonal variation in hcrt levels, we obtained data on hcrt- 1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 227 human individuals evaluated for central <b>hypersomnias</b> at a Danish sleep center. The samples were taken over a 4 year timespan, and obtained in the morning hours, thus avoiding impact of the diurnal hcrt variation. Hcrt- 1 concentration was determined in a standardized radioimmunoassay. Using biometric data and sleep parameters, a multivariate regression analysis was performed. We found that the average monthly CSF hcrt- 1 levels varied significantly across the seasons following a sine wave with its peak in the summer (June-July). The amplitude was 19. 9 pg hcrt/mL [12. 8 - 26. 9] corresponding to a 10. 6 % increase in midsummer compared to winter. Factors found to significantly predict the hcrt- 1 values were day length, presence of snow, and proximity to the Christmas holiday season. The hcrt- 1 values from January were much higher than predicted from the model, suggestive of additional factors influencing the CSF hcrt- 1 levels such as social interaction. This study provides evidence that human CSF hcrt- 1 levels vary with season, correlating with day length. This finding could have implications for the understanding of winter tiredness, fatigue, and seasonal affective disorder. This is the first time a seasonal variation of hcrt- 1 levels has been shown, demonstrating that the hcrt system is, like other neurotransmitter systems, subjected to long term modulation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the diagnostic values, longitudinal stability, and HLA {{association of the}} sleep stage transitions in narcolepsy. Methods: To compare the baseline differences in the sleep stage transition to REM sleep among 35 patients with type 1 narcolepsy, 39 patients with type 2 narcolepsy, 26 unaffected relatives, and 159 non-narcoleptic sleep patient controls, followed by a reassessment at a mean duration of 37. 4 months. Results: The highest prevalence of altered transition from stage non-N 2 /N 3 to stage R in multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) was found in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (92. 0 % and 57. 1 %), followed by patients with type 2 narcolepsy (69. 4 % and 12. 8 %), unaffected relatives (46. 2 % and 0 %), and controls (39. 3 % and 1. 3 %). Individual sleep variables had varied sensitivity and specifi city in diagnosing narcolepsy. By incorporating a combination of sleep variables, the decision tree analysis improved the sensitivity to 94. 3 % and 82. 1 % and enhanced specifi city to 82. 4 % and 83 % for the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy, respectively. There was a signifi cant association of DBQ 1 ∗ 0602 with the altered sleep stage transition (OR = 16. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 149. 8, p = 0. 015). The persistence of the altered sleep stage transition in both MSLT and NPSG was high for both type 1 (90. 5 % and 64. 7 %) and type 2 narcolepsy (92. 3 % and 100 %), respectively. Conclusions: Altered sleep stage transition is a signifi cant and stable marker of narcolepsy, which suggests a vulnerable wake-sleep dysregulation trait in narcolepsy. Altered sleep stage transition has a signifi cant diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of <b>hypersomnias,</b> especially when combined with other diagnostic sleep variables in decision tree analysis.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} awareness for recognition of sleep disorders in India; however, {{there is still a}} huge gap {{in the number of people}} suffering from various sleep disorders, in the community versus those visiting hospital clinics for the same. Ours is a neurology services-based sleep disorders clinic, which has evolved successfully over the last decade. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the changes in referral patterns and distribution of various sleep disorders in the patients presenting to the clinic. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective chart review-based study on all patients seen over an 8 -year period, divided into 2 groups comprising of patients seen during the first 4 years versus those seen over the next 4 years. Only those patients who had the sleep disorder as their presenting manifestation and those who had been formally interviewed with a pre-structured questionnaire detailing about the main features of the common sleep disorders according to the ICSD-R were included. Patients, in whom the sleep disorder could be clearly attributable to another neurological or systemic disorder, were excluded. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify the differences between the two groups as regards the distribution of various sleep disorders and other clinical data. Results: Among 710 patients registered in the clinic, 469 were included for analysis and 222 patients formed group 1 while 247 formed group 2. The main differences observed were in the form of a clear increase in the percentage of patients with sleep-related breathing disorders, sleep-related movement disorder, and the <b>hypersomnias</b> on comparison of distribution over the first 4 years versus the last 4 years; while a clear decline was seen in the number of patients with insomnia and parasomnias. A 3 -fold increase was observed in the number of patients in whom polysomnography was obtained. Conclusion: The distribution of various sleep disorders as seen in a neurology service-based sleep clinic is demonstrated in this study. Increasing referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and fewer referrals for insomnia and parasomnias might reflect on changing physician and patient awareness in our community...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{there is a lack of}} research on ADHD in older adults, and until recently only a few case reports existed. Method: A systematic search was conducted in the databases Medline/PubMed and PsycINFO in order to identify studies regarding ADHD in adults ≥ 50  years. Results: ADHD persists into older ages in many patients, but the prevalence of patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis at age ≥ 50  years is still unknown. It is reason to believe that the prevalence is falling gradually with age, and that the ADHD symptom level is significantly lower in the age group 70 – 80  years than the group 50 – 60  years. There is a lack of controlled studies of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years, but this review suggests that many patients aged ≥ 50  years experience beneficial effects of pharmacological treatment. The problem with side effects and somatic complications may rise to a level that makes pharmacotherapy for ADHD difficult after the age of 65  years. Physical assessment prior to initiation of ADHD medication in adults ≥ 50  years should include a thorough clinical examination, and medication should be titrated with low doses initially and with a slow increase. In motivated patients, different psychological therapies alone or in addition to pharmacotherapy should be considered. Conclusion: It is essential when treating older adult patients with ADHD to provide good support based on knowledge and understanding of how ADHD symptoms have affected health, quality of life, and function through the life span. Individualized therapy for each elderly patient should be recommended to balance risk–benefit ratio when pharmacotherapy is considered to be a possible treatment.
