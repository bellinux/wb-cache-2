50|$|On May 23, 2010, Voyager 2 resumed sending science {{data from}} deep space after {{engineers}} fixed the flipped bit. Currently research {{is being made}} into marking the area of memory with the flipped bit off limits or disallowing its use. The Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument is currently operational, and data from this instrument concerning charged particles is being transmitted to Earth. This data permits measurements of the heliosheath and termination shock. There {{has also been a}} modification to the on-board flight software to delay turning off the AP Branch 2 backup heater for one year. It was scheduled to go off February 2, 2011 (DOY 033, 2011-033).On July 25, 2012, Voyager 2 was traveling at 15.447 km/s relative to the Sun at about 99.13 AU km from the Sun, at −55.29° declination and 19.888 <b>h</b> <b>right</b> ascension, and also at an ecliptic latitude of −34.0 degrees, placing it in the constellation Telescopium as observed from Earth.

50|$|After {{the events}} of WrestleMania, both Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker took a four month hiatus from the WWE. Shawn came back to reform D-Generation X with Triple H so that they {{came face to face}} with The Legacy at SummerSlam. The Undertaker also {{returned}} at SummerSlam and attacked the then-World Heavyweight Champion, CM Punk. At the Slammy Awards, the Undertaker and Shawn Michaels won the Best Match of the Year, with Shawn expressing that he was glad that he had created history at WrestleMania, but just when he was about to leave, he challenged the Undertaker to a rematch at the next WrestleMania. The Undertaker later denied the challenge, saying he had nothing more to prove to Michaels, and told Michaels that he would have to earn the spot. Michaels later entered the Royal Rumble (2010), but would be eliminated by Batista. He later tried to enter the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship, but he was defeated by Randy Orton to earn the spot. Then at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Shawn cost The Undertaker his World Heavyweight Championship. The next night on Raw, the Undertaker accepted the rematch, but only on the condition that Michaels would retire from WWE if he lost. At WrestleMania XXVI The Undertaker defeated Shawn Michaels in a Streak vs Career Match, thus ending Michaels' career. The next night on Raw, Shawn said farewell to WWE, with his best friend and DX member Triple <b>H</b> <b>right</b> next to him as they spent their last time, together before Shawn finally left the building.|$|E
50|$|Triple H {{challenging}} Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship was {{the main}} event. The first fall of the match was a Street fight. Michaels and Triple H battled inside {{and out of the}} ring. Triple H tried to suplex Michaels over the ropes and through the table, but Michaels countered and suplexed Triple <b>H</b> <b>right</b> back into the ring. Michaels attempted the Sweet Chin Music, however Triple H caught Michaels and twisted Michaels' knee. Triple H focused on Michaels knee throughout the match. Triple H brought out a 2 X 4 wrapped in barbed wire, which he then lit on fire, with the flames provided on the stage. However, Michaels countered Triple H's attack and nailed him right in the face with the flaming board, which resulted in Triple H's forehead being busted open. However, Triple H picked up the first fall as he pinned Michaels after a Pedigree. The second fall was a Steel Cage match. In the match, Triple H catapulted Michaels into the wall of the cage, which was followed by Triple H grinding Michaels head {{into the side of the}} cage. After back and forth action between Triple H and Michaels, Michaels scored the second fall, after he Splashed Triple H through a table off the cage. The third and last fall of the night was a Ladder match. Michaels grabbed a ladder in which resulted in him dropping the ladder on Triple H's back which was quickly followed by Michaels suplexing Triple H on the ladder. The match concluded with Triple H retrieving the World Heavyweight title, after he pushed Michaels off the ladder, which resulted in Michaels crashing through four stacked tables on the outside.|$|E
