5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. <b>He</b> <b>cracked</b> down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

25|$|Sidhu {{walked out}} of India's 1996 tour of England citing {{differences}} with captain Mohammad Azharuddin. Following this, he was banished from the team for ten Tests by the BCCI eventually making a return in the 1996–97 tour of West Indies. In the second Test at Queen's Park Oval, he scored a double century. The 201, his highest score in Tests lasted 11 hours. Known for his tendency to attack spinners, <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> eight sixes in 124 against Sri Lanka in 1993–94, and four fifties in five innings against the Australians in 1997–98, deliberately singling out Shane Warne.|$|E
25|$|Dawson's {{first team}} debut for Gloucestershire {{came in a}} Sunday League match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in May 1992. The {{following}} month he made his first-class debut against Lancashire at Old Trafford. Initially, Dawson was a regular feature in the Gloucestershire team. Primarily a batsman, in his first couple of seasons with the county he struggled with his batting form, averaging 11.00 and 21.87 in the 1992 and 1993 seasons respectively, although in the 1992 season he did record his maiden half century. The 1994 season was to prove to be Dawson's most productive in first-class cricket, making 16 first-class appearances and scoring 1,112 runs (the only time in his first-class career he would pass 1,000 runs in a season) at a batting average of 42.76. Indeed, with this season it seemed that Dawson's potential was beginning to be fulfilled as <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> a maiden century, scoring 127* against Cambridge University and scoring seven half centuries.|$|E
25|$|Martin was the {{beneficiary}} at the Volta a Catalunya {{of an injury}} sustained by 's Levi Leipheimer. The American had occupied a podium spot, second, before the flat final stage, but a re-occurrence of an abdominal injury left him physically unable to complete the race. Leipheimer's withdrawal moved Martin onto the event's final podium in third. Kreder claimed a surprise win at the Circuit de la Sarthe, pipping race leader Daniele Bennati {{at the end of}} stage 2 after the Italian had started his sprint early from an early leadout. Zabriskie won the long time trial at the Tour de Romandie. He bettered all the intermediate time checks of early stage leader Richie Porte, and was two seconds better than the Australian at the finish. While Zabriskie has a reputation as a top time trial specialist, this was the first individual time trial in Europe that he had won since the 2006 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, and first victory of any kind since a road race win in the 2010 Tour of California. The team attended the Tour of California with a squad led by two-time runner-up Zabriskie. He effectively lost any chance at winning the race overall in stage 4, when <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> on the Sierra Road climb and finished 32nd, nearly five minutes down on the day's winner (and eventual Tour winner) Chris Horner. He rebounded two days later to win the Solvang time trial, ahead of three-time winner Levi Leipheimer in a new course-record time. Danielson and Vandevelde had fared somewhat better in the climbing stages and finished the race in third and fourth overall, respectively. Zabriskie's final position was 33rd.|$|E

In 1972, the couple posed together in a nude Playboy spread, recreating some sex scenes from Boxcar Bertha. Later in 1972, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free, who changed his name to Tom when he was nine years old.

LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 individual time trial, and he finished second to the Spaniard Miguel Indurain. LeMond felt he was riding extremely well, and though his TT-effort had propelled him into the yellow jersey, losing eight seconds to Indurain shook his confidence. He held the yellow jersey {{for the next four}} days until Stage 12, a challenging [...] mountain stage. LeMond experienced difficulty on the first climb and <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> on the Col de Tourmalet, losing significant time to Claudio Chiappucci, and eventual winner Indurain. He continued to race, but was unable to seriously challenge for the lead thereafter, finishing the 1991 Tour seventh overall.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{military}} and loyal militia mopped up {{the remnants of}} the rebellion in Wexford and other counties, the atrocities and sectarian violence left a mark on Cornwallis. He wrote that [...] "the life of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland comes up to my idea of a perfect misery; but if I can achieve the great object of consolidating the British Empire, I shall be sufficiently repaid." [...] In early July he issued a proclamation offering amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and took an oath to the crown, and <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> down on the sometimes arbitrary courts martial held in the field by requiring the review of all sentences in Dublin. [...] However, not all of Ireland received this treatment: areas that were still [...] "disturbed" [...] were exempted from the requirement, Lord Castlereagh, Cornwallis' Chief Secretary, reported that [...] "numbers were tried and executed" [...] without the lord lieutenant's review. One principal stronghold of the rebels was the Wicklow Mountains, through which the army began construction of a road facilitate its operations. [...] The Wicklow Military Road survives today as the R115 road in Wexford and Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Cancellara's pedigree, 2011 successes, {{and status}} as {{defending}} champion {{made him a}} major favorite for the second monument race, the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara put in a seemingly decisive move {{from the head of}} the main field on the Leberg, the fourteenth cobbled climb on the day's parcours. He quickly opened up a time gap of over a minute, and the race seemed to be decided. <b>He</b> <b>cracked</b> on the Muur van Geraardsbergen, however, and was swept up by an elite leading group of favorites and contenders. He put in a second acceleration on the last climb, the Bosberg, and was followed by Sylvain Chavanel and Nick Nuyens. Having perhaps spent himself too early in the race by attacking solo and not working with other riders to gain a large time gap, Cancellara could only manage third of the three. After the race, Cancellara blasted Nuyens and the other riders in the race, saying they only rode to keep him from winning. He referred to himself as a [...] "gladiator" [...] and said that the manner in which Nuyens won, staying in Cancellara's slipstream and then outsprinting him with the line in view, had no value in his eyes.|$|E

He paid the 100,000 francs, not to me but to the French national team which Fachleitner was riding, which was the rule. Which brought me another outburst from René Vietto. 'You poor fool fada,' he said to me, 'you should {{have asked for a}} lot more! What's this going to be worth once we've shared it between us?'

Within a month, <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> the starting lineup, replacing Rui Costa in the attacking midfield playmaking position, behind strikers Jon Dahl Tomasson, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko. His Serie A debut was in a 2–0 win over Ancona. He scored ten goals in 30 appearances that season, also providing several important assists, such as the cross which led to Shevchenko's title-deciding headed goal, as Milan won the Scudetto and the UEFA Super Cup, whilst finishing as runner up in the Intercontinental Cup and the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana. Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing out to eventual winners Lazio, and were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo de La Coruña. Due to his performances in his debut season, in 2004, Kaká was named Serie A Footballer of the Year, and was nominated for both the Ballon d'Or (finishing in 15th place) and the FIFA World Player of the Year Awards (finishing in ninth place).|$|E
2500|$|Trotsky {{and several}} other Soviet figures {{promoted}} the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity. This idea gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union but was misleading. According to Montefiore, [...] "it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that Stalin was always exceptional, even from childhood". Stalin had a complex mind, {{with a great deal}} of self-control. He rarely raised his voice in anger, although as his health declined in later life he became increasingly unpredictable and bad tempered. A hard worker, he displayed a keen desire to learn, and had an excellent memory. When in power, he scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware. He was a capable actor who could play many different roles to different audiences, and was adept at deception, often lying or deceiving others as to his true motivates and aims. Several historians have seen it appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being [...] "several Stalins" [...] as a means of understanding his multi-faceted personality. He judged others according to their inner strength, practicality, and cleverness. Despite his short temper and tough-talking attitude, he could be very charming; when relaxed, <b>he</b> <b>cracked</b> jokes and mimicked others.|$|E
