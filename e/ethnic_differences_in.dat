25|$|The {{distribution}} of the PON1 polymorphisms varies with ethnicity. The frequency of the PON1-192R allele increases the further from Europe a population originates, the frequency in Caucasians of 15-30% increases to 70-90% in Far Eastern Oriental and Sub-Saharan African populations. In the southern US African-Americans are five {{times more likely to}} be RR than Caucasians. In contrast the PON1-55M allele is much less frequent in Oriental and black African populations compared to Caucasians and are extremely rare or absent in some populations e.g. Thais. These <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> SNP distribution can lead to large activity differences between populations.|$|E
40|$|Reviews of the self-report {{literature}} {{suggest that}} shyness is more prevalent among East Asians than among those of European heritage. We evaluated {{the generalizability of}} that claim with four studies comparing students of Asian heritage (AH) and European heritage (EH). Study I (N = 897) confirmed a substantially higher rate of self-reported shyness among AH students (68 %) than among EH students (44 %). In Study 2 (N = 309), the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> self-reported shyness was substantially higher for classroom than for social situations. In Study 3 (N = 213), the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> was strong for cross-ethnicity socializing but nil for same-ethnicity socializing. In Study 4 (N = 250), a behavioral index-classroom participation-was recorded and coded. The observed <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> participation rate showed a medium effect size comparable to the self-report difference. There was no <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference,</b> however, <b>in</b> the mean complexity and challengingness of the classroom participations or in final course grades. We conclude that the <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> is maximal for classroom participation because the latter situation combines several key contributing factors to Asian shyness.

Kattaha was originally given the name Hannikkun. The usage of the term Kattaha over Hannikkun, according to Ronald Gorny (head of the Alisar regional project in Turkey), was a device to downgrade the Pre-Hittite identity of this female deity, and to bring her {{more in touch with}} the Hittite tradition. Their reconfiguration of Gods throughout their early history such as with Kattaha was a way of legitimizing their authority and to avoid conflicting ideologies in newly included regions and settlements. By transforming local deities to fit their own customs, the Hittites hoped that the traditional beliefs of these communities would understand and accept the changes to become better suited for the Hittite political and economic goals.|$|E
2500|$|These {{constant}} {{shifts in}} the perception of Cleopatra are well represented in a review of Estelle Parsons' adaptation of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra at the Interart Theatre in New York City. Arthur Holmberg surmises, [...] "What had at first seemed like a desperate attempt to be chic in a trendy New York manner was, in fact, an ingenious way to characterise the differences between Antony's Rome and Cleopatra's Egypt. Most productions rely on rather predictable contrasts in costuming to imply the rigid discipline of the former and the languid self-indulgence of the latter. By exploiting <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> speech, gesture, and movement, Parsons rendered the clash between two opposing cultures not only contemporary but also poignant. In this setting, the white Egyptians represented a graceful and ancient aristocracy—well groomed, elegantly poised, and doomed. The Romans, upstarts from the West, lacked finesse and polish. But by sheer brute strength they would hold dominion over principalities and kingdoms." [...] This assessment of the changing way in which Cleopatra is represented in modern adaptations of Shakespeare's play is yet another example of how the modern and postmodern view of Cleopatra is constantly evolving.|$|E
2500|$|Cross-cultural {{studies of}} {{stuttering}} prevalence were {{very active in}} early and mid-20th century, particularly {{under the influence of}} the works of Wendell Johnson, who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents. Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering, and even the word [...] "stutterer", were absent (for example, among some tribes of American Indians). Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races at similar rates, about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the incidence of stuttering in preschool children. At the same time, there are cross-cultural studies indicating that the difference between cultures may exist. For example, summarizing prevalence studies, E. Cooper and C. Cooper conclude: [...] "On the basis of the data currently available, it appears the prevalence of fluency disorders varies among the cultures of the world, with some indications that the prevalence of fluency disorders labeled as stuttering is higher among black populations than white or Asian populations" [...] (Cooper & Cooper, 1993:197).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> present <b>in</b> the {{scientific}} literature {{used as the basis}} for the Dutch College of General Practitioner's (NHG) practice guidelines were reflected in the ethnic-specific information the guidelines contained. DESIGN: Analysis of published information. METHOD: The scientific literature used {{as the basis for the}} guidelines about type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and asthma in adults was collected and carefully screened. Relevant ethnic-specific information was compared to the content of the guidelines. RESULTS: Several relevant <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> were stated <b>in</b> {{the scientific literature}} used as the basis for the guidelines. <b>Differences</b> <b>in</b> prevalence and clinical progress were stated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> lung-volume were stated for asthma and <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> prevalence, onset, complications, response to pharmacological treatment and dietary salt restriction were stated for hypertension. The type 2 diabetes mellitus guideline stated a higher prevalence of diabetes in Hindustani people and recommended earlier screening in this group. The asthma guideline stated that the lung volume is dependent of ethnicity. The hypertension guideline did not state any ethnic-specific information. CONCLUSION: The guidelines on type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and asthma in adults only adopted a limited number of the <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> contained <b>in</b> the scientific literature on which they were based. Possible explanations are that information was only included if there was a clear scientific basis, and that ethnic distinctions were found to be politically and socially undesirable.

In recent years, research {{has suggested that}} adoption status and family interactions are associated with adolescent externalizing behaviors. Conversations that acknowledge racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>differences</b> between international adoptees and adoptive parents may also be important for adjustment. However, this association has never been empirically validated. This study tests associations between family interactions, acknowledging racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference,</b> and adolescent adjustment using a sample of 222 adolescent Korean adoptees and their families. Families that acknowledge racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> had adolescents with the fewest externalizing behaviors. General family interactions were associated with acknowledging difference, where positive adolescent communication and dominant mothers tended to be associated with acknowledging difference. Contradictory of general population research, generally positive communication across family members was associated with an increase in adolescent externalizing behavior. Future directions suggest examining the effects of acknowledging racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> adoptive families for non-adopted sibling and parent adjustment.
