500|$|During {{the early}} years of Capon Chapel, no Protestant {{denomination}} was the <b>exclusive</b> <b>owner</b> or occupant, and the church was probably utilized as a [...] "union church" [...] for worship by any Christian denomination. Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the 1890s, Capon Chapel was added as a place of worship on the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. As of 2017, Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the United Methodist Church, holding Methodist services 4 Sundays a month at 1pm. [...] Open table communion is held on the 1st Sunday of each month.|$|E
500|$|During the church's early years, no Protestant {{denomination}} was the <b>exclusive</b> <b>owner</b> or {{occupant of}} Capon Chapel, {{which indicates that}} the church was probably utilized as a [...] "union church" [...] for worship by any Christian denomination. Since no single denomination oversaw the church during this early period, few records of its early activities and construction exist. Later records suggest that Capon Chapel {{was used as a}} place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. While it remains unclear why or how the church became associated with the Baptists, its use by the denomination is possibly associated with the Second Great Awakening, a Protestant revival movement during the early-to-mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout the United States. According to the December 1904 issue of The Baptist Home Mission Monthly, the Baptist Little Cacapon Church contributed one dollar to the general fund of Capon Chapel, demonstrating that the Baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with the church in 1904.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1980, the {{collaboration}} between Bandler and Grinder ended. [...] On 25 September 1981, Bandler instituted a civil action against Grinder and his company, seeking injunctive relief and damages for Grinder's commercial activity in relation to NLP. On 29 October 1981, judgement was made in favor of Bandler. [...] As part of a settlement agreement Bandler granted to Grinder a limited 10-year license to conduct NLP seminars, offer certification in NLP and use the NLP name {{on the condition that}} royalties from the earnings of the seminars be paid to Bandler. In July 1996 and January 1997, Bandler instituted a further two civil actions against Grinder and his company, numerous other prominent figures in NLP and 200 further initially unnamed persons. Bandler alleged that Grinder had violated the terms of the settlement agreement reached in the initial case and had suffered commercial damage {{as a result of the}} allegedly illegal commercial activities of the defendants. Bandler sought from each defendant damages no less than US$10,000,000.00. [...] In February 2000, the Court found against Bandler, stating that [...] "Bandler has misrepresented to the public, through his licensing agreement and promotional materials, that he is the <b>exclusive</b> <b>owner</b> of all intellectual property rights associated with NLP, and maintains the exclusive authority to determine membership in and certification in the Society of NLP." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{original}} Council was {{not simply}} twelve men of exceptional ability; they fused, it was a council of genius. It struck boldly for riches, for political influence, and the two subserved each other. With amazing foresight it spent great sums of money {{on the art of}} flying, holding that invention back against an hour foreseen. It used the patent laws, and a thousand half-legal expedients, to hamper all investigators who refused to work with it. In the old days it never missed a capable man. It paid his price. Its policy in those days was vigorous--unerring, and against it as it grew steadily and incessantly was only the chaotic selfish rule of the casually rich. In a hundred years Graham had become almost <b>exclusive</b> <b>owner</b> of Africa, of South America, of France, of London, of England and all its influence--for all practical purposes, that is--a power in North America--then the dominant power in America. The Council bought and organised China, drilled Asia, crippled the Old World empires, undermined them financially, fought and defeated them.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuity}} {{and the success}} of organizations appear increasingly associated with the incorporation of social media. The success depends of the structural and procedural changes that the organization has to make. Today, social media are the new digital marketing tools that help in the processes of communication. Companies need to understand that they are no longer the <b>exclusive</b> <b>owners</b> of the relation of consumers with their products/services; instead, the survival of the organizations depends of the effective utilization of the social media. Creative and innovative solutions are not necessarily too expensive and the internet ends up being one of the best marketing tools available for the organizations. In a more transparent and dynamic world, consumers trust other people to provide advice and recommendations about products and services more and more through social media and {{it is important to know}} how and why social media influence organizations. This study analyzes through a literature review the current importance of social media for digital marketing communication and shows a case study on traditional shops that use social media to obtain competitive advantages over shopping centers in Funchal (Madeira, Portugal). To finish, the study proposes a new model of business for successful marketing strategies. Also, the article explains how to manage the changes associated and how collaborators need to get used to working in a wider and more dynamic community...|$|R

40|$|Femtocells, also {{sometimes}} referred to using the term "Home NodeB" (HNB), are low-power, low-cost cellular base stations utilizing a high speed internet connection as the backhaul. The recent hike in interest for femtocells in the market calls {{for a study of}} their impact on quality of service and possible mechanisms in resource allocation devised to address the problems that arise from their deployment. The work presented concentrates on three aspects of the resource allocation problem. Firstly, the access policies in heterogeneous networks consisting of macro and femto base stations are considered with the aim to ensure acceptable quality of service provided to all users while improving for some including the owners of the device. Access policies are studied that lie between the two extremes of fully open access and fully closed to <b>exclusive</b> <b>owners</b> of the device. The second aspect under study is packet scheduling mechanisms. While works exist on intra-cellular scheduling mechanisms as well as centralized inter-cellular schemes that provide a globally near- optimal scheduling, the body of work on global and uncoordinated scheduling mechanism is small, which is explored in this work. The third part of the study focuses on hand-off minimization over a network of moving mobile stations. We aim to find optimal handoff sequences in a series of predicted possible paths in front of a moving mobile station. A graph-based algorithm is explored in the third part of the study...|$|R

40|$|The {{industries}} {{relying on}} limitations and exceptions to copyright are a sizable part of Australia’s economy. Copyright can strengthen {{the incentive to}} create by affording content <b>owners</b> <b>exclusive</b> rights to exploit their work. This can bring into existence work that would not otherwise exist, generating economic benefits. A content <b>owner’s</b> <b>exclusive</b> rights are subject to limitations and exceptions. These mediate the respective rights of the myriad participants in the copyright eco-system, where increasingly intellectual property outputs are developed from intellectual property inputs, where creators are also users, users are creators and copyright material cannot be distributed digitally without copies being made. Limitations and exceptions determine questions like: 	How much may be quoted from a copyrighted work without permission? 	In what circumstances can {{someone who has a}} legitimate copyrighted work change the format in which it has been supplied, or the time and place at which they use it?  	Where intermediaries make digital copies of copyrighted works to help disseminating them to legitimate users, in what, if any, circumstances must they obtain explicit permission? This report was prepared for the Australian Digital Alliance by John Houghton and Nicholas Gruen, Lateral Economics. A companion report, Excepting the future, makes the economic case for flexible copyright exceptions and extended safe harbour provisions.  ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluating a booleanfunction on PRAMs. We exhibit a boolean function f: 0, 1 n! 0, 1 that can be evaluated in time O(log log n) in a deterministic CROW (ConcurrentRead Owner Write) PRAM model, but requires time Ω (log n) in EROW (<b>Exclusive</b> Read <b>Owner</b> Write) PRAM. Our lower bound also holds in the randomized Monte Carlo EROW model. This boolean function isderived from the well-known pointer chasing problem, and was first considered by Nisan and Bar-Yossef [10]. Our lower bound improves a special case of the previous result of Nisan and Bar-Yossef, who proved a lowerbound of Ω (plog n) for this function in the deterministicEREW model (and hence in the EROW model). Our result {{is the first to}} achieve the best possible separationbetween the CROW and EROW PRAM models for functions on complete domains (boolean or nonboolean),improving the previous results ([7, 6, 10]) ...|$|R
