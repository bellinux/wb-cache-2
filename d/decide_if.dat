5|$|On September 10, British troops {{moved from}} Long Island to occupy Montresor's Island, {{a small island}} {{at the mouth of}} the Harlem River. One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was not authorized to grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, postpone the impending British attack, allowing Washington more time to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> and where to confront the enemy.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the computational complexity of several decision {{problems in a}} simple strategic game of network formation. We find that <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> a player has a strategy that guarantees him a certain payoff against a given strategy profile of the other players is an NP-complete problem. <b>Deciding</b> <b>if</b> there exists a strategy profile that guarantees a certain aggregate payoff is also NP-complete. <b>Deciding</b> <b>if</b> there is a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies which guarantees a certain payoff to each player is NP-hard.

5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> persons should {{be deprived of}} their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and comply with the requirements of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 also {{introduced}} section8B(2), {{which is an}} ouster clause providing that no judicial review of orders made under the ISA shall be available save in relation to questions relating to the procedural requirements of the ISA. In Teo Soh Lung, the Court of Appeal held {{that it was not}} necessary for it to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> the subjective test in Lee Mau Seng precluded judicial review in the case. Hence, the position remains to be confirmed by the courts. In addition, the Court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the effect of section8B(2) on issues not related to national security and the constitutionality of the 1989 amendments to the ISA.|$|E
5|$|The refugee {{controversy}} in Sjöbo, Sweden, {{refers to the}} surrounding events of the 1988 referendum that banned Sjöbo Municipality from admitting foreign refugees. In 1987, despite opposition and demonstrations, local Centre Party politician Sven-Olle Olsson (1929–2005), who was Sjöbo's municipal commissioner at the time, was successful in gaining {{the support of the}} Sjöbo municipal assembly to hold a referendum to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> Sjöbo should ban the acceptance of foreign refugees. The controversial referendum passed with a 67.4% majority for the ban in 1988, gaining Olsson and Sjöbo much publicity in the Swedish media. The outcome was heavily criticized by Swedish media and politicians (including then-Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson).|$|E

5000|$|The conjugacy {{problem was}} {{identified}} by Max Dehn in 1911 {{as one of}} the fundamental decision problems in group theory; the other two being the word problem and the isomorphism problem. The conjugacy problem contains the word problem as a special case: if x and y are words, <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> they are the same word is equivalent to <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> [...] is the identity, which is the same as <b>deciding</b> <b>if</b> it's conjugate to the identity. In 1912 Dehn gave an algorithm that solves both the word and conjugacy problem for the fundamental groups of closed orientable two-dimensional manifolds of genus {{greater than or equal to}} 2 (the genus 0 and genus 1 cases being trivial).|$|R

5|$|The ship can {{be moved}} {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a set number of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> they wanted to allow professionals.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

The gist of Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Åland is a {{collection}} of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and Finland. The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with Finland, were taken by Imperial Russia. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands {{to be a part of}} their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland, formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.|$|E
