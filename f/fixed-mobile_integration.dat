40|$|Abstract—The {{interaction}} among {{information and communication}} technology (ICT) industries is a recently ubiquitous phenomenon through <b>fixed-mobile</b> <b>integration.</b> To monitor the impact of interaction, previous research has mainly focused on measuring spillover effect among ICT industries using various methods. Among others, inter-industry analysis {{is one of the}} useful methods for examining spillover effect between industries. However, more complex ICT industries become, more important the impact within an industry is. Inter-industry analysis is limited in mirroring intra-relationships within an industry. Thus, this study applies the analytic network process (ANP) to measure the spillover effect, capturing all of the intra and inter-relationships. Using ANP-based intra and inter-industry analysis, the spillover effect is effectively measured, mirroring the complex structure of ICT industries. A main ICT industry and its linkages are also explored to show the current structure of ICT industries. The proposed approach is expected to allow policy makers to understand interactions of ICT industries and their impact. R Keywords—ANP, intra and inter-industry analysis, spillover effect I...|$|E

Major {{shifts in the}} distribution of production costs of regulated firms are induced by modern microelectronics, photonics, and fixed and mobile internet platforms, creating new networked service markets adjacent to the regulated telephone activities. The confluence of regulated and unregulated markets poses dilemmas in deciding on issues of open access to the new opportunities for competitive providers and/or consumers. This contribution briefly discusses the general regulatory issues and two specific cases, namely, <b>fixed-mobile</b> service <b>integration</b> and licensing of third-generation mobile networks.
