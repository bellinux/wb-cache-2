5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} before 1989 and the {{break-up}} of the Soviet Union, the Klarsfelds (Serge Klarsfeld and his wife Beate) frequently protested against the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> support for the PLO and anti-Zionism.|$|R
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|While Stalin's {{death in}} 1953 {{slightly}} relaxed tensions, {{the situation in}} Europe remained an uneasy armed truce. The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> ceased to exist; with it, so did all {{applicability}} of the term Second World. The definitions of the First World and Third World changed slightly, yet generally described the same concepts.|$|E
50|$|The {{cold war}} period saw Finland attempt to stake {{a middle ground}} between the western and <b>eastern</b> <b>blocs,</b> in order to appease the USSR so as to prevent another war, and even held new {{elections}} when the previous results were objectionable to the USSR.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, Mitterrand {{was worried}} by the rapidity of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc's</b> collapse. He {{was opposed to}} German reunification but came {{to see it as}} unavoidable. [...] He was opposed to the swift {{recognition}} of Croatia and Slovenia, which he thought would lead to the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} was {{and continues to}} be the development and common use of communications satellites. It was created as the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> response to the Western Intelsat organization. As of 2008 the organization has 25 member states, among them the Federal Republic of Germany as the legal successor of the GDR.|$|R
5|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} between Cuba and the United States continued {{for some time}} after Batista's fall, but President Eisenhower deliberately left the capital to avoid meeting Cuba's young revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during the latter's trip to Washington in April, leaving Vice President Richard Nixon to conduct the meeting in his place. Cuba began negotiating arms purchases from the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> in March 1960.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka's thaw {{was caused}} by several factors. The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the {{resulting}} de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> Nikita Khrushchev's speech, On the Personality Cult and its Consequences, had wide implications for the Soviet Union and other Communist countries as well.|$|E
5|$|In September 1947, the Soviets created Cominform, {{the purpose}} of which was to enforce orthodoxy within the {{international}} communist movement and tighten political control over Soviet satellites through coordination of communist parties in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> Cominform faced an embarrassing setback the following June, when the Tito–Stalin Split obliged its members to expel Yugoslavia, which remained communist but adopted a non-aligned position.|$|E

2500|$|Although Friendship Games {{officials}} {{denied that}} the Games were to be a counter-Olympic event to avoid conflicts with the International Olympic Committee, the competition was often dubbed the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> [...] "alternative Olympics". Some fifty states {{took part in the}} competition. While the boycotting countries were represented by their strongest athletes, other states sent their reserve teams, consisting of athletes who failed to qualify for Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Gerardo Aguilar Ramírez, {{known by}} his nom de guerre César, was a Colombian guerrilla {{leader of the}} Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). He was the {{commander}} of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> 1st Front. For five years {{he was in charge of}} FARC's hostages, including former presidential candidate Íngrid Betancourt. On July 2, 2008, the hostages were rescued in Operation Jaque and César was arrested.|$|R
5|$|Media in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and subservient to the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|Poland's {{communist}} government attempted {{to destroy the}} union by instituting martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, {{but in the end}} was forced into negotiation. The Roundtable Talks {{between the government and the}} Solidarity-led opposition resulted in semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wałęsa was elected president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the {{communist government}}al system and by Poland's transformation into a modern democratic state. Solidarity's early survival represented a break in the hard-line stance of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and was an unprecedented event; not only for the People's Republic of Poland—a satellite of the USSR ruled by a one-party communist regime—but for the whole of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>bloc.</b> Solidarity's example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> weakening communist governments. This process later culminated in the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet leadership's {{policy towards}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> {{did not change}} much with Khrushchev's replacement, as the states of Eastern Europe were seen as a buffer zone {{essential}} to placing distance between NATO and the Soviet Union's borders. The Brezhnev regime inherited a skeptical attitude towards reform policies which became more radical in tone following the Prague Spring in 1968. János Kádár, the leader of Hungary, initiated a couple of reforms similar to Alexei Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. The reform measures, named the New Economic Mechanism, were introduced in Hungary during Khrushchev's rule, and were protected by Kosygin in the post-Khrushchev era. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalize the economy of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since {{it was trying to}} reduce its large <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> subsidy program in the form of cheap oil and gas exports.|$|E

2500|$|Before the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> dissolution, {{some major}} sectors of {{industry}} were operating {{at such a}} loss that they exported products to the West at prices below {{the real value of}} the raw materials. [...] Hungarian steel costs doubled those of western Europe. In 1985, a quarter of Hungary's state budget was spent on supporting inefficient enterprises. [...] Tight planning in Bulgaria industry meant continuing shortages in other parts of its economy.|$|R
50|$|According to some historians, Moscow was {{concerned}} about the Marshall Plan. Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and South-East Asia. Comecon was the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co-Operation (OEEC), a prelude to the European Economic Community (founded in 1957) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (founded in 1961).|$|R
5|$|After the Communist Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc.</b> The city annexed new land, and the {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{consolidating}} Stalin's {{control over}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc,</b> the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), led by Lavrentiy Beriya, supervised the establishment of Soviet-style secret police systems in the Bloc {{that were supposed to}} crush anti-communist resistance. When the slightest stirrings of independence emerged in the Bloc, Stalin's strategy matched that of dealing with domestic pre-war rivals: they were removed from power, put on trial, imprisoned, and in several instances, executed.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{research}} existing on Japan-China diplomatic rapprochement, less {{has been investigated}} by {{taking into account the}} interaction between the two actors within the framework of intervening variables that influenced their historical path. The stages that have marked the development of Japan-China relations should be, indeed, included and interpreted in the broader context of the Cold War. This paper aims at exploring how the differences between the Western and <b>Eastern</b> <b>blocs,</b> and the structure of the international system, have influenced the evolution of their diplomatic relations...|$|R
50|$|World junior {{champion}} in Belgrade in 1982, Procházka missed the 1984 Olympics {{because of the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> boycott but {{went on to win}} two medals at the 1987 senior World Championships in Duisburg, West Germany. In the individual C-1 500 m he was the silver medallist. He also won a bronze medal in the C-2 500 m with partner Alan Lohniský. At the 1988 Summer Olympics however he came a disappointing eighth in the C-1 500 m and ninth in the C-2 500 m.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the onset}} of the Cold War, Europe was divided among the Western and <b>Eastern</b> <b>blocs.</b> Germany was [...] divided into two {{countries}} and two special territories, the Saarland and divided Berlin. Initially the Federal Republic of Germany claimed an exclusive mandate for all of Germany, considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871-1945 German Reich. It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted puppet state. Though the GDR did hold regular elections, these were not free and fair. From the West German perspective, the GDR was therefore illegitimate.|$|R
5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by the Afghan people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of the Afghan military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in the Afghan army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the {{foundation}} for the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc</b> by invading and then annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics, by agreement with Nazi Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. These included eastern Poland (incorporated into two different SSRs), Latvia (which became the Latvian SSR), Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR), Lithuania (which became the Lithuanian SSR), part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR).|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{much of the}} Cold War period, the Congress {{supported}} a foreign policy of nonalignment that called for India to form ties with both the western and <b>eastern</b> <b>blocs,</b> but to avoid formal alliances with either. American support for Pakistan led the Party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971. In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh. This Singh-led [...] "UPA I" [...] government executed several key pieces of legislation and projects, including the Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, the Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, and the Right to Information Act.|$|R
500|$|Casino Royale {{was written}} after, and was heavily {{influenced}} by, the Second World War; Britain {{was still an}} imperial power, and the Western and <b>Eastern</b> <b>blocs</b> were engaged in the Cold War. The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire, [...] "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." [...] The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree, and consider that [...] "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining." ...|$|R
50|$|In London, reporters {{interview}} a Russian pilot about the MiG-242, the world's most powerful fighter-bomber. Although the pilot {{is quick to}} point out the MiG-242's specifications are unrivalled by any aircraft in the West, he is unaware that Professor McClaine and Sam Loover are transmitting his brain pattern by means of a concealed antenna to the McClaine cottage, where it is subsequently transferred to Joe via the BIG RAT. The boy is then supplied with a unique pair of glasses fitted with electrodes that, while worn, give him access to all the pilot's knowledge and experience. Joe's mission is to capture a MiG-242 and fly it to England, thus removing the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Bloc's</b> tactical advantage over the West.|$|R
