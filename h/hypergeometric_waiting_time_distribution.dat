40|$|On the {{elementary}} level, electronic current consists of individual electron tunnelling {{events that are}} separated by random <b>time</b> intervals. The <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> is a probability to observe the electron transfer in the detector electrode at time t+τ given that an electron was detected in the same electrode at earlier time t. We study <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> for quantum transport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration interaction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we obtain master equation and compute the <b>distribution</b> of <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> for electron transport. The details of <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> are used to elucidate microscopic mechanism of electron transport {{and the role of}} electron-vibration interactions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction, the skewness and dispersion of the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> experience stepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are associated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons. In the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease dominates over all other changes in the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> as the molecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|<b>Waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> and the zero-frequency full {{counting}} {{statistics of}} unidirectional electron transport through a double quantum dot molecule attached to spin-polarized leads are analyzed using the quantum master equation. The <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> exhibits a non-trivial {{dependence on the}} value of the exchange coupling between the dots and the gradient of the applied magnetic field, which reveals the oscillations between the spin states of the molecule. The zero-frequency full counting statistics, on the other hand, is independent of the aforementioned quantities, thus giving no insight into the internal dynamics. The fact that the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> and the zero-frequency full counting statistics give a non-equivalent information is associated with two factors. Firstly, it {{can be explained by the}} sensitivity to different timescales of the dynamics of the system. Secondly, it is associated with the presence of the correlation between subsequent <b>waiting</b> <b>times,</b> which makes the renewal theory, relating the full counting statistics and the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution,</b> not longer applicable. The study highlights the particular usefulness of the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> for the analysis of the internal dynamics of mesoscopic systems. Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>distribution</b> of <b>waiting</b> <b>times</b> between electrons emitted from a periodically driven single-electron turnstile. To this end, we develop a scheme for analytic calculations of the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> for arbitrary periodic driving protocols. We illustrate the general framework by considering a driven tunnel junction {{before moving on}} to the more involved single-electron turnstile. The <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distributions</b> are evaluated at low temperatures for square-wave and harmonic driving protocols. In the adiabatic regime, the dynamics of the turnstile is synchronized with the external drive. As the non-adiabatic regime is approached, the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> becomes dominated by cycle-missing events in which the turnstile fails to emit within one or several periods. We also discuss the influence of finite electronic temperatures.

40|$|We study a {{queueing}} {{network with}} a single shared server that serves the queues in a cyclic order. External customers arrive at the queues according to independent Poisson processes. After completing service, a customer either leaves the system or is routed to another queue. This model is very generic and finds many applications in computer systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems, and robotics. Special cases of the introduced network include well-known polling models, tandem queues, systems with a waiting room, multi-stage models with parallel queues, and many others. The present research develops a novel unifying framework to find the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution,</b> which {{can be applied to}} a wide variety of models which lacked an analysis of the <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>distribution</b> until now.
