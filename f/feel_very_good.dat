She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life.

500|$|Blow {{recognized}} that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, {{and did not have}} any set difficulty curve. He designed most of the game's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles, allowing them to experience the rest of the game even if they could not solve a difficult puzzle. Only certain boss fights require the player to defeat the enemy character before continuing on, using a combination of the time mechanics. Blow hoped that players would be able to find solutions to puzzles they had skipped by completing puzzles later in the game. Blow felt that [...] "unearned rewards are false and meaningless", and thus included collectibles earned only after solving a puzzle. He strongly discouraged players from using a walkthrough to work their way through Braid, instead encouraging players to solve them on their own so that they [...] "will <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about" [...] completing the puzzles without help; Blow created his own official [...] "walkthrough" [...] that guides the player but instead restates his insistence that the player work through the puzzles on their own. Some puzzles pay homage to other video games; one level features a Donkey Kong-inspired puzzle, and the ending of most worlds tells the player that [...] "the princess is in another castle", similar to the end of each world in Super Mario Bros.|$|E

The concert benefited the United Nations Children's Fund. Shortly after, {{it was revealed}} that members Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog had been separated for several months. Despite this, Agnetha assured the media that the group was united, stating, [...] "Everyone <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at the moment. We are working well together and we still have something to give".|$|R
5000|$|Sculpting is her {{preferred}} artistic medium, Qaunak stated, [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> when you're {{comfortable in}} {{feeling good about}} your carvings especially when other people like your carvings. Then {{you know you can}} do a carving each and every time you begin one." [...] Her work evolves as she builds as she does not depend on preconceived ideas. She began her sculpting practice with simple subjects and spare forms. These evolved in volume and complexity as she developed her artistic style. At times she will combine multiple subjects to create totemic or superimposed forms.|$|R
30|$|Happiness (xingfu) is {{a modern}} word from Japan’s late {{imperial}} period that began {{to be used in}} the early twentieth century (Chen 2014). A concept influenced by Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, xingfu encompasses friendship, learning, self-knowledge, virtue and living in simplicity. Colloquially, to say that someone is happy (xingfu) could mean that one <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about one’s life, that their relationships with friends and family (especially parents) are good. To say, “my family is happy (wo jiating hen xingfu),” might indicate that my parents are healthy, my children are well, that I have lots of friends, and personal accomplishments (like career or material wealth).|$|R
2500|$|In a {{study of}} casual sex among adolescents, many girls {{believed}} {{they could have a}} purely sexual experience with no emotional ties, and they believed it was sexist to assume otherwise. [...] However, the study found that both the girls and the boys who were hooking up often were depressed and didn't <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about themselves.|$|E

60|$|The reader may, perhaps, be {{somewhat}} surprised that a middle-aged couple, not very strong, or <b>very</b> <b>good</b> walkers, the lady loaded with a basket containing {{two bottles of}} wine and a metal drinking-cup, and the gentleman carrying a heavy knapsack, filled {{with all sorts of}} odds and ends, strapped to his shoulders, should set off on a seven-mile walk, jump over a wall, run up a hillside, and yet <b>feel</b> in <b>very</b> <b>good</b> trim to enjoy a sunset view. This peculiar state of things I will proceed to explain.|$|R

6000|$|... "But he wasn't satisfied. No, Sir, he wasn't satisfied. Whatever Mr. Mink did, {{he wanted}} to do well. He could run well and climb well, and there was no better hunter in all the Green Forest. He was bound that he would swim well. So he kept trying and trying. He learned to fill his lungs with air and hold his breath for a long time, while he swam as fast as ever he could with his head under water as he had seen his cousin, Mr. Otter, swim. The more he did this, the longer he could hold his breath. After a while he found that because he was slim and trim and moved so fast, he could out-swim Mr. Muskrat, and this made him <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> indeed, for Mr. Muskrat spent nearly all his time in the water and was {{accounted}} a very good swimmer. There was only one thing that bothered Mr. Mink. The water was so dreadfully wet! Every time he came out of it, he had to run his hardest to dry off and keep from getting cold. This was very tiresome and he did wish that there was an easier way of drying off.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} of the finale varied. Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger wrote [...] "so the amazing four-year journey of Battlestar Galactica comes to an end, and I <b>feel</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about it-even as I suspect others may not." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times praised Moore and the writing team for [...] "not copping out" [...] and commented that it was [...] "hard to imagine a more visually and thematically satisfying finale". Richard Vine of The Guardian opined that [...] "somehow, {{out of all the}} doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, Battlestar Galactica finished with something approaching a happy ending." [...] He concluded that the episode was ultimately satisfying, noting that [...] "most of the major questions were dealt with in some form or another." ...|$|R

Sometimes I'll be quite good at the first 10 seconds of a song, then I'm lost. [...] "I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)" [...] was like that." ...|$|R

30|$|With {{professional}} help from Italians, ZR’s clothing business has achieved deeper insights and creativity. ZR began designing styles according to customer demands: “The designer and I first consider {{the needs of}} customers, combined with my own feelings, and the designer quickly draws style drafts. We choose the style according to customer demand, quickly design, plate, cut on the computer, and then choose the right fabric sample to make a model. The foreigner, in accordance with Italian specifications, draws on the computer. It’s faster than we Chinese people. He can draw a dozen drawings a day. He also adjusts design and our models of procurement according to the fabric sample. In this way the design is a better aesthetic fit with Italian and European customers.” In addition, ZR created a unique style for his brand: “Our suppliers, the company decoration, clothing style must all comply with the customer's taste, and every piece of clothing has its cultural heritage. The shirt brand is basically my own design. My vision {{might not be the}} same as others. If such models based on my design do not have taste, without a certain feeling, I immediately throw them away, and redo. If it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> then it’s OK. Things that feel good also sell well. The business is slowly getting better”.|$|R

We <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> comfortable and <b>good</b> about drafting Bullington.""Being a college pitcher, he's {{going to be a little}} closer than a high school draftee...I'd anticipate we're looking at him a couple of years away." ...|$|R

That made me <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good.</b> I realized that it was something physical, not only mental, that you had to have." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Oracle Corporation hired {{a detective}} agency to {{investigate}} two research groups that supported Microsoft during the antitrust trial. After attempting to buy garbage, the agency discovered {{that those two}} research groups were falsely identifying themselves as independent advocacy groups {{when they were in}} reality funded by Microsoft. Oracle and the hired detective agency may have acted in questionable matters to obtain that information, but they believe that the outcome justifies their actions. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, says: “I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> about what we did. … Maybe our investigation organization may have done things unsavoury, but it's not illegal. We got the truth out.” ...|$|E

"The {{basic idea}} of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, {{was married to a}} very {{promising}} but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family.

Roy and April Pitt arrive as the play opens; they are recently married movie stars who are already seeking couples therapy because of their frequent bickering. Anal-retentive Harry Schupp has been at Dunelawn for three months, and on this day his wife Dolly decides to drive up to encourage him to come home. Hiram and Francis are old friends of questionable sexuality who have been at Dunelawn since it opened years ago, content to stay indefinitely courtesy of Francis' family fortune.
