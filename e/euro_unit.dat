40|$|SPEAR is {{the acronym}} for the European {{research}} project Seismic PErformance Assessment and Rehabilitation of existing buildings, and the SPEAR building is the three-storey replica {{of an existing}} non-seismic building, full-scale tested at the ELSA Laboratory. In previous studies, a practical cost-benefits {{analysis was used to}} compare the performance of the specimen in the two different rehabilitated configurations: GFRP-retrofitted specimen and RC-jacketed structure. This paper presents a method to assess the best solution between alternative interventions in-cluding sustainability issues in the economic evaluation. The main aim of this study, in fact, is to create an integrated approach as the key to make choices in terms of life cycle cost benefits analysis. Normally, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a process to evaluate the environmental burdens as-sociated with a product, process, or activity by identifying and quantifying energy and materials used and wastes released to the environment (from the cradle to grave). In the present study LCA methodology is calibrated as a decision support tool for economic analysis. At this regard, the first step was the environmental impacts analysis derived from the production (pre-use phase), installation (use phase) and waste treatment (end of life phase) of the two retrofitting measures. SimaPro software (version 7. 1. 8) was used to implement LCA model and to carry out the assessment in terms of tons CO 2 emissions. It is clear that environmental results are not compatible with cost analysis (expressed in Euro) for the two configurations; therefore, to define a global result, CO 2 emissions are converted in <b>Euro</b> <b>unit,</b> considering both the costs of the expected damages and the benefits derived from global climate change.

40|$|On 22 September 2000, the French, Belgian and Dutch {{stock exchanges}} merged and formed the Euronext N. V., the first pan-European ex change. The {{creation}} of Euronext {{was a response}} to changes in the political and econ omic environment in Europe. The benefits to market participants are easier access t o a wider range of financial products, increase in liquidity and lower transaction costs. Indeed, since its incorporation, Euronext has the second largest capitalization in E urope. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the conseq uences of Euronext integration on the French, Belgian and Dutch stock markets. It rai ses two questions: 1. has the merger improved the information efficiency of the m arkets; and 2. has the level of integration between the markets increased following the incorporation of Euronext? The study uses daily prices for the markets’ main i ndices for the period 01 / 01 / 1990 to 10 / 12 / 2010. The original sample is divided into thr ee periods: pre-integration, integration and post-integration period. Two types of returns are computed: log- returns and excess returns. A dummy variable and a control variable, the German main index DAX, are included in the analysis to acc ount for the effect of the introduction of the <b>Euro.</b> <b>Unit</b> root and stationarity tests show that prices s eries are integrated of the first order and that the returns series are stationary. Moreove r, the volatility of returns exhibits long-memory patterns. The data generating process o f all the returns series is captured with ARMA-GARCH models. The returns exhibit volatil ity clusters in all sub- periods. Hence, the information efficiency of the m arket has not increased following Euronext integration. However, GARCH models do not include an asymmetric component for the post-integration period, indicati ng that the returns do not display leverage effects after the creation of Euronext. Fi nally, a Euro dummy variable was significant only for the Belgian returns. Cointegration tests show that the three indices exp erience long-run equilibrium during the integration and the post-integration periods. M oreover, the conditional correlation between the markets increases and stabilises after 2000. Overall, the evidence supports wider financial integration between these markets. However, it is difficult to 4 determine to what degree this change can be attribu ted to the creation of Euronext as opposed to the introduction of the Euro or to a com bination of both. A Granger causality test shows that EMU has Granger caused ma rket financial integration. On the other hand, a system comprised of the three ind ices and the control variable, DAX 30, does not display long-run equilibrium for th e post-integration period, highlighting the role of Euronext.

In the Czech Republic (CR), the emphasis is placed on the utilization of a good thermal insulation for large buildings, which can finally provide certain energy savings.

The internal environment of reconstructed insulated buildings is continuously getting worse with the increase in CO 2 concentrations and humidity rH. Many investors in the CR do not take this fact into account. To decrease the concentration of CO 2 in a room we can easily open a window and a door, or to use a forced ventilation as the part of a complex solution provided by HVAC technology (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). Regarding the technology utilization in connection with the automatization of buildings, it is necessary to provide the measurement of CO 2 concentration before the implementation of HVAC controlled technology.|$|R

France's fleet in service, presently put at about 14, 000 units, consumes about 2 per cent of the total energy of city transport. It causes about 2 per cent of the HC emissions and from 4 to 6 per cent of the NOx emissions and particles.

The impact of selection against boar taint on production traits was assessed for different economic weights of boar taint compounds. Genetic gain and breeding costs were evaluated using ZPlan+, a software based on selection index theory, gene flow method and economic modeling. Scenario I reflected the currently practiced breeding strategy {{as a reference}} scenario without selection against boar taint. Scenario II incorporated selection against the chemical compounds of boar taint, androstenone (AND), skatole (SKA) and indole (IND) with economic weights of − 2. 74, − 1. 69 and − 0. 99 <b>Euro</b> per <b>unit</b> of the log transformed trait, respectively. As information sources, biopsy-based performance testing of live boars (BPT) was compared with genomic selection (GS) and a combination of both. Scenario III included selection against the subjectively assessed human nose score (HNS) of boar taint. Information sources were either station testing of full and half sibs of the selection candidate or GS against HNS of boar taint compounds. In scenario I, annual genetic gain of log-transformed AND (SKA; IND) was 0. 06 (0. 09; 0. 02) Euro, which was because of favorable genetic correlations with lean meat percentage and meat surface. In scenario II, genetic gain increased to 0. 28 (0. 20; 0. 09) Euro per year when conducting BPT. Compared with BPT, genetic gain was smaller with GS. A combination of BPT and GS only marginally increased annual genetic gain, whereas variable costs per selection candidate augmented from 230 Euro (BPT) to 330 Euro (GS) or 380 Euro (both). The potential of GS {{was found to be}} higher when selecting against HNS, which has a low heritability. Annual genetic gain from GS was higher than from station testing of 4 full sibs and 76 half sibs with one or two measurements. The most effective strategy to reduce HNS was selecting against chemical compounds by conducting BPT. Because of heritabilities higher than 0. 45 for AND, SKA and IND and high genetic correlations to HNS, the (correlated) response in units of the trait could be increased by 62 % compared with scenario III with GS and even by 79 % compared with scenario III, with station testing of siblings with two measurements.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether sonohysterography (SHG) {{should be performed}} with Plexiglas hysterosalpingographic vacuum cups instead of standard catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective setting, 226 women randomly classified into 2 groups underwent SHG. The method used for cervical cannulation was a two-way catheter in the first group (n = 108) and a Plexiglas hysterosalpingographic vacuum cup in the second one (n = 118). Diagnostic reliability, easy applicability for the physician, discomfort for the patients and cost of the instruments were assessed for both devices. RESULTS: 226 / 226 (100 %) complete sonohysterographic examinations were performed. As regards uterine cavity distension the same diagnostic reliability was reported for vacuum cups and two-way catheters. The standard catheter obscured the cervical canal because of the dilation of the balloon. Both methods were judged as easy to use, and {{no statistically significant difference}} was found as far as the time required for cervical cannulation (p 0. 05). A little more discomfort was recorded by women who underwent sonohysterography with standard balloon catheters but a greater interpersonal variability was noticed in this group (SD 3. 65 vs. 1. 13 in the vacuum cup group). Vacuum cups were by far the most economical devices (unit cost: 16. 70 <b>euro</b> vs. catheter <b>unit</b> cost 46. 20 euro).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness of a behavioral graded exercise therapy (GET) program compared with usual care (UC) {{in terms of}} the performance of daily activities by patients with chronic shoulder complaints in primary care. METHODS: A total of 176 patients were randomly assigned either to GET (n= 87) or to UC (n= 89). Clinical outcomes (main complaints, shoulder disability [SDQ] and generic health-related quality of life [EQ- 5 D], and costs [intervention costs, direct health care costs, direct non-health-related costs, and indirect costs]) were assessed during the 12 -week treatment period and at 52 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Results showed that GET was more effective than UC in restoring daily activities as assessed by the main complaints instrument after the 12 -week treatment period (p =. 049; mean difference, 7. 5; confidence interval [CI], 0. 0 - 15. 0). These effects lasted for at least 52 weeks (p =. 025; mean difference 9. 2; CI, 1. 2 - 17. 3). No statistically significant differences were found on the SDQ or EQ 5 D. GET significantly reduced direct health care costs (p =. 000) and direct non-health care costs (p =. 029). Nevertheless, total costs during the 1 -year follow-up period were significantly higher (p =. 001; GET = Euro 530 versus UC = Euro 377) due to the higher costs of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the main complaints (0 - 100), SDQ (0 - 100), and EQ- 5 D (- 1. 0 - 1. 0) were Euro 7, Euro 74, and <b>Euro</b> 5278 per <b>unit</b> of improvement, respectively.

The system boundary is the alpine forest fuel system, from logging operations at the forest stand to combustion of woody biofuels at the heating plant. The functional unit is 1 m 3 solid over bark of woody biomass, delivered to the district heating plant in Cavalese (Trento). The relative sustainability of traditional and innovative systems is compared and energy use is estimated. Results show that the overall GWP and costs are about 13 kg CO 2 equivalent and 42 <b>euro</b> per functional <b>unit</b> respectively for the innovative system. Along the product supply chain, chipping contributes the greatest share of GWP and energy use, while extraction by yarder has the highest financial costs. The GWP is reduced by 2. 3 ton CO 2 equivalent when bioenergy substitutes fuel oil and 1. 7 ton CO 2 equivalent when it substitutes natural gas. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that variations in fuel consumption and hourly rates of cost have a great influence on chipping operation and extraction by cable yarder concerning GWP and financial analysis, respectively. This is confirmed by sensitivity analysis. Better technologies, the use of biofuels along the product supply chain and more efficient systems might reduce these impacts. Replacing the traditional system with the innovative one reduces emissions and costs. A low energy input ratio is required for harvesting logging residues. The direct employment potential is a conflicting aspect and needs further investigations...|$|R

The research was carried out within five different Universities spread all over the Country, namely: Brescia, Lecce, Politecnico di Milano, Parma and Politecnico di Torino, for a total budget of about 250. 000 <b>euros.</b> Five Research <b>Units</b> (RU) were involved because their specific experience {{in the fields of}} tunnel linings. In particular: (RU 1) the Department DICATA of the University of Brescia and the Department of Innovation Engineering of the University of Salento (Lecce) have experience in the field of Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) and in the optimization of structural behaviour of segmental lining; (RU 2) Department DITAG of Politecnico di Torino has been working on conventional and mechanized tunnels and on the soil-structure in-teraction; (RU 3) Department DISTR of Politecnico di Torino did research on the soil-structure interaction and on the structural optimization of final lining in conventional tunnels; (RU 4) Department DIS of Politecnico di Milano has been active in the field of mechanical properties of concrete under high temperatures and on the fire resistance of high performance concrete while (RU 5) Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Parma did several research studies on nonlinear analyses of reinforced concrete and developed a specific model for FRC based on fracture mechanics. The book summarizes the main aspects arose during the development of the research project. General issues concerning tunnel linings, both conventional and segmental, were investigated within the main objective of the research that was the improving of the knowledge on the structural behavior and the construction methodologies of these structures. Furthermore, general aspects concerning newer materials for use in tunnel linings are presented with particular reference to Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) ...|$|R

The {{published}} {{version of the}} article you can find here: [URL] extended Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is performed for evaluating the impacts of a woody biomass supply chain for heating plants in the alpine region. Three main aspects of sustainability are assessed: greenhouse gas emissions, represented by global warming potential (GWP) impact category, costs and direct employment potential.

5000|$|The {{funding of}} {{political}} parties, independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated {{in comparison with}} developed western democracies. Applicable legislation encompasses cash receipts, provision of free services (except the labour of volunteers), and products {{and other forms of}} support (including membership fees). The legislation also stipulates that the government budget provides funding for political parties and non-partisan political representatives in the amount of 0.05 percent of the previous year's budget expenditures. Additional funds are appropriated in local government budgets. The funds are distributed to elected members of parliament and councils, and the political parties with which they are affiliated receive 10 percent of the funds. Each election candidate (or slate) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election-campaign donations, other related funding, and all campaign-related expenditures. The maximum donation to a single party, candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated. In cases of individuals it is set at 30,000 kuna ( [...] 4,050 euro), regardless of purpose. Companies and other legal persons are limited to the same amount in local elections; 100,000 kuna ( [...] 13,500 euro) for parliamentary or European Parliament elections and 200,000 kuna ( [...] 27,000 euro) for presidential elections to any one candidate, party or slate (whichever is applicable). Total campaign expenditures are also limited to 8 million kuna ( [...] 1.08 million euro) per candidate in presidential elections, 1.5 million kuna ( [...] 202,000 euro) per candidate (or slate) in European Parliament or parliamentary elections, 500,000 kuna ( [...] 67,600 euro) per candidate in Zagreb mayoral elections and 400,000 kuna ( [...] 54,000 euro) per candidate in county-prefect or mayoral elections in cities of 35,000 residents or larger and in county seats. Mayoral election-campaign expenditures in other cities and towns is also limited, depending on the local government's population: 250,000 kuna ( [...] 33,800 euro) if the population exceeds 10,000 residents, 100,000 kuna ( [...] 13,500 <b>euro)</b> in population <b>units</b> of 3,000-10,000 and up to 50,000 kuna ( [...] 6,750 euro) in smaller self-governing units. All candidates and parties (or slates) are legally required to publish financial reports detailing their funding, which are audited by the State Electoral Commission and the State Audit Office. They are also legally required to turn over all receipts exceeding the legal limits in favour of the central government budget within eight days.|$|R
