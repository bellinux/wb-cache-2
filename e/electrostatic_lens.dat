The team consisted of several PhD students including Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries. The research team worked on lens design and CRO column placement, to optimize parameters to construct better CROs, and make electron optical components to generate low magnification (nearly 1:1) images. In 1931 the group successfully generated magnified images of mesh grids placed over the anode aperture. The device used two magnetic lenses to achieve higher magnifications, arguably creating the first electron microscope. In that same year, Reinhold Rudenberg, the scientific director of the Siemens company, [...] patented an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> electron microscope.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>electrostatic</b> and {{magnetic}} <b>lenses</b> may be used. However, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> have more aberrations {{and so are}} not used for fine focusing. There is no current mechanism to make achromatic electron beam lenses, so extremely narrow dispersions of the electron beam energy are needed for finest focusing.|$|R
50|$|Since {{electron}} spectroscopy detects several physical phenomena {{from the}} electrons emitted from samples, {{it is necessary}} to transport the electrons to the electron analyser. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> satisfy the general properties of lenses.|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of cylindrical multi-element <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> at the nanoscale presents a challenge; they are high-aspect-ratio structures {{that should be}} rotationally symmetric, well aligned and freestanding, with smooth edges and flat, clean surfaces. In this paper, we present the fabrication results of a non-conventional process, which uses a combination of focused gallium ion-beam milling and hydrofluoric acid vapor etching. This process {{makes it possible to}} fabricate nanoscale <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> down to 140 nm in aperture diameter and 4. 2 µm in column length, with a superior control of the geometry as compared to conventional lithography-based techniques...|$|R

50|$|An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> is {{a device}} that assists in the {{transport}} of charged particles. For instance, it can guide electrons emitted from a sample to an electron analyzer, analogous to the way an optical lens assists in the transport of light in an optical instrument. Systems of electrostatic lenses can be designed {{in the same way}} as optical lenses, so electrostatic lenses easily magnify or converge the electron trajectories. An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> can also be used to focus an ion beam, for example to make a microbeam for irradiating individual cells.|$|E
50|$|The recent {{development}} of electron spectroscopy {{makes it possible}} to reveal the electronic structures of molecules.

50|$|Electron optics is a {{mathematical}} {{framework for the}} calculation of particle paths along given electrostatic or magnetostatic fields. The term optics is used because a charged particle beam can be manipulated using magnetic or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> {{in a similar fashion}} to the manipulation of a light beam with optical lenses.|$|R
50|$|An einzel lens is an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> {{that focuses}} without {{changing}} {{the energy of}} the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular tubes in series along an axis.|$|E

Six plates are parallel to the flight path with the middle plate at a particular potential. (This diagram was made for positive ions, and shows a positive voltage on the central plate. For electrons this voltage must be negative.) ...|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{dependency}} is {{given for the}} kinetic energy itself depending {{on the power of}} the velocity.So for an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> the focal length varies with the second power of the kinetic energy,while for a magnetostatic lens the focal length varies proportional to the kinetic energy.And a combined quadrupole can be achromatic around a given energy.|$|E
50|$|The pair {{of plates}} is also called an <b>electrostatic</b> {{immersion}} <b>lens,</b> thus an einzel lens {{can be described}} as two or more <b>electrostatic</b> immersion <b>lenses.</b> Solving the equation above twice to find the change in radial velocity for each pair of plates can be used to calculate the focal length of the lens.|$|R

The periodical system of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> (<b>electrostatic</b> undulator) was proposed for ribbon beam transport line. The design of transport system and the results of the beam dynamics investigation are presented. The influence of the electrodes construction errors on the beam dynamics is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Source ions {{are then}} {{generally}} accelerated to an energy of 1-50 keV (kiloelectronvolts), and focused onto the sample by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses.</b> LMIS produce high current density ion beams with very small energy spread. A modern FIB can deliver tens of nanoamperes of current to a sample, or can image the sample with a spot size {{on the order}} of a few nanometers.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} focus charged {{particles}} in the RARAF microbeam, an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> consisting of six quadrupole arranged in two triplets with each successive quadrupole rotated by 90° around its axis, is used. Each quadrupole triplet consists of 4 ceramic rods on which gold electrodes were plated. This design ensures alignment of the three quadrupoles in the triplet and allows a small pole-gap and better focusing properties.|$|E
50|$|Velocity map imaging {{is based}} on the use of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> to {{accelerate}} the ions toward the detector. When the voltages are properly adjusted, this lens has the advantage that it focuses ions with the same velocity to a single spot on the detector regardless where the ion was created. This technique thus overcomes the blurring caused by the finite overlap of the laser and molecular beams.|$|E
50|$|A Wehnelt acts as {{a control}} grid and it {{also serves as a}} {{convergent}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens.</b> An electron emitter is positioned directly above the Wehnelt aperture, and an anode is located below the Wehnelt. The anode is biased to a high positive voltage (typically +1 to +30 kV) relative to the emitter so as to accelerate electrons from the emitter towards the anode, thus creating an electron beam that passes through the Wehnelt aperture.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s {{the second}} {{generation}} (PEEM-2) and third generation (PEEM-3) microscopes were constructed. PEEM-2 is a conventional not aberration-corrected instrument employing <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses.</b> It uses a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) fiber-coupled to a phosphor to detect the electron-optical image. The aberration corrected microscope PEEM-3 employs a curved electron mirror to counter the lowest order aberrations of the electron lenses and the accelerating field.|$|R

50|$|The RARAF {{microbeam}} {{is adding}} an x-ray microbeam using characteristic Kα x rays from Ti. The x rays will be generated using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> system to focus protons onto a thick Ti target. The x rays generated are demagnified using a zone plate. By using the already focused proton microbeam to generate characteristic x rays, {{it is possible}} to obtain a nearly monochromatic x-ray beam (very low bremsstrahlung yield) and a reasonably small x-ray source (~20 µm diameter), reducing the requirements on the zone plate.|$|E
50|$|Instead of an {{electrostatic}} field {{we can also}} use a magnetic field to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion, and to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest magnetic lens is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil, and gets weaker as we move away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens,</b> the paths in a magnetic lens contain a spiraling component, i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a magnetic lens is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens.</b> The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other magnetically soft material) magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties, and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) in which the single flight tube of a conventional TOFMS has been replaced by several cylindrical <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> in tandem.

5000|$|However, when G1 {{becomes less}} {{negative}} {{with respect to}} the cathode, another cylindrical electrode designated G2, which is hundreds of volts positive referred to the cathode, attracts electrons through the hole. Their trajectories converge as they pass through the hole, creating quite-small diameter [...] "pinch" [...] called the crossover. Following electrodes ("grids"), <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses,</b> focus this crossover onto the screen; the spot is an image of the crossover.|$|R
5000|$|Ion beam manipulator, {{includes}} the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> of the ion gun for focusing and beam-chopping. Lenses {{consist of a}} series of either plate or cylinder geometries and serve to collimate the beam as well as to selectively filter the beam based on mass and velocity. Beam chopping is performed using a pulsed-wave generator when time-of-flight (TOF) experiments are performed. Ions only pass through the chopper when there is no applied voltage.|$|R
5000|$|What {{is special}} about side-window tubes is an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> {{is used to}} focus the beam onto a very small spot on the anode. The anode is {{specially}} designed to dissipate the heat and wear resulting from this intense focused barrage of electrons. Some anodes are mechanically spun to increase the area heated by the beam (e.g. edical [...] "rotating anode") or cooled by circulating coolant (indirectly on most rotating anodes). The anode is precisely angled at 1-20 degrees off perpendicular to the electron current so as to allow the escape {{of some of the}} X-ray photons which are emitted perpendicular to the direction of the electron current. The anode is usually made out of tungsten or molybdenum. The tube has a window designed for escape of the generated X-ray photons.|$|E
50|$|Alec Broers {{began his}} {{research}} {{career in the}} Engineering Department of the University of Cambridge in 1961 working with Professor Oatley, and later with Dr William C Nixon, on the in situ study of surfaces undergoing ion etching in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The microscope he used had originally been built by Oatley and had then been modified Garry Stewart who had also added an ion source that focussed ions onto the sample surface. Garry Stewart, who was another of Professor Oatley's students, then moved to the Cambridge Instrument Company where he oversaw the design and building of the world's first commercial SEM, the Stereoscan. During his PhD Alec rebuilt the SEM fitting a magnetic final lens {{in place of the}} original <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> thereby improving the microscope's resolution to about 10 nm, and after examining ion etched surfaces, used the microscope's electron beam {{for the first time to}} write patterns, subsequently using ion etching to transfer these patterns into gold, tungsten and silicon structures as small as 40 nm. These were the first man-made nanostructures in materials suitable for microelectronic circuits opening up the possibility for the extreme miniaturization of electronic circuits that was to occur in the decades to come.|$|E
50|$|In a {{delay line}} {{detector}} the electrons are accelerated to 500 eV between {{the back of}} the last MCP and a grid. Then they fly for 5 mm and are dispersed over an area of 2 mm. A grid follows. Each element has a diameter of 1 mm and consists of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lens</b> focusing arriving electrons through a 30 µm hole of a grounded sheet of aluminium. Behind that a cylinder of the same size follows. The electron cloud induces a 300 ps negative pulse when entering the cylinder and a positive when leaving. After that another sheet, a second cylinder follows, and a last sheet follows. Effectively the cylinders are fused into the center-conductor of a stripline. The sheets minimize cross talk between the layers and adjacent lines in the same layer, which would lead to signal dispersion and ringing. These striplines meander across the anode to connect all cylinders, to offer each cylinder 50 Ω impedance, and to generate a position dependent delay. Because the turns in the stripline adversely affect the signal quality their number is limited and for higher resolutions multiple independent striplines are needed. At both ends the meanders are connected to detector electronics. These electronics convert the measured delays into X- (first layer) and Y-coordinates (second layer). Sometimes a hexagonal grid and 3 coordinates are used. This redundancy reduces the dead space-time by reducing the maximum travel distance and thus the maximum delay, allowing for faster measurements. The microchannel plate detector must not operate over around 60 degree Celsius, otherwise it will degrade rapidly, bakeout without voltage has no influence.|$|E

The electron energy analyzers, one is for selection and the other is for analysis, are made of oxygen-free copper and their diameters are 90 mm along the electron path. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>lenses</b> have three or four components and were designed {{on the basis of a}} trajectory calculation. The scattering angle can be varied from- 5 ° to 110 °. The energy resolution of the spectrometer was determined to be 60 meV from a half-width of the 1 s- 2 p transition of He. The spectra and its allgular dependence of He agreed with the previous results. The spectra of nitrogen and methanol at low electron energies and at various scattering angles were measured, and several features have been assigned as singlet-triplet transitions...|$|R
