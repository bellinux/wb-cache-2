40|$|Background: Adoption of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> for {{pathological}} specimens {{has been}} slower than adoption of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> in radiology, despite {{a number of}} anticipated advantages for <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> in pathology. In this paper, we explore the factors that might explain this slower rate of adoption. Materials and Method: Semi-structured interviews on barriers and facilitators {{to the adoption of}} <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> were conducted with two radiologists, three pathologists, and one pathologist′s assistant. Results: Barriers and facilitators to adoption of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> were reported in the areas of performance, workflow-efficiency, infrastructure, integration with other software, and exposure to <b>digital</b> <b>images.</b> The primary difference between the settings was that performance with the use of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> as compared to the traditional method was perceived to be higher in radiology and lower in pathology. Additionally, exposure to <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> was higher in radiology than pathology, with some radiologists exclusively having been trained and/or practicing with <b>digital</b> <b>images.</b> The integration of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> both improved and reduced efficiency in routine and non-routine workflow patterns in both settings, and was variable across the different organizations. A comparison of these findings with prior research on adoption of other health information technologies suggests that the barriers to adoption of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> in pathology are relatively tractable. Conclusions: Improving performance using <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> in pathology would likely accelerate adoption of innovative technologies that are facilitated by the use of <b>digital</b> <b>images,</b> such as electronic imaging databases, electronic health records, double reading for challenging cases, and computer-aided diagnostic systems...|$|R

The case of multistage embedding the modified stegodata in transformation domain of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> is considered. Data hiding in transformation domain of <b>digital</b> <b>images.</b> The Gunjal method of message hiding in <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> is investigated. The method is based on usage of Arnold transform for mangling the stegodata. Embedding of modified message is carried out by applying of two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform and block two-dimensional discrete cosine transform. Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis of <b>digital</b> <b>images.</b> The correlation and fractal characteristics of the <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> noise components are consider. It is shown the advantages of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis over classic detrended fluctuation analysis ? the representation of signal fluctuation as set of monofractal aggregates with corresponding generalized Hurst exponents. Conclusion. Data hiding in transformation domain of <b>digital</b> <b>images</b> leads to smoothing of spectrum the generalized Hurst exponents and narrowing the multifractal spectrum of fluctuations. It is established that ascertained disclosure features do not depend on degree of container filling. ? ?????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ???????????. ??????????, ??? ??????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ??????, ? ????? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????????...|$|R

5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

It is possible for a person to apply for a renewal of the ID card via a representative with a notary signed permit, provided there are no significant changes in his or hers appearance. There are, however limitations. If you apply via a representative, you must receive the new ID yourself. Vice versa, if you applied yourself, then an authorized representative may receive your ID.
