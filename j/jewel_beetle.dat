5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E

50|$|Evolutionary {{mismatch}} {{can also}} be seen among insects. One such example is {{in the case of the}} Giant <b>Jewel</b> <b>Beetle</b> (Julodimorpha bakewelli). The male <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> has evolved to be attracted to certain features of the female <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> that allow the male <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> to identify a female as it flies across the desert. These features include size, color, and texture. However, these physical traits are seen manifested in beer bottles as well. As a result, male jewel beetles often consider beer bottles more attractive than female jewel beetles due to the beer bottle's large size and attractive coloring. Beer bottles are often discarded by humans in the Australian desert that the <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> thrives in, creating an environment where male jewel beetles prefer to mate with beer bottles instead of female jewel beetles. This is a situation that is extremely disadvantageous as it reduces the reproductive output of the <b>jewel</b> <b>beetle</b> as fewer beetles are mating. This condition can be considered an evolutionary mismatch, as a habit that evolved to aid in reproduction has become disadvantageous due to the littering of beer bottles, an anthropogenic cause.|$|E
