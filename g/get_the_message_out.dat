40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{linkages}} between television {{news and the}} decline of partisanship in Latin America, using survey data for eight countries. After discussing the erosion of traditional Latin American parties during the 1990 s, I show that the literature has assumed different types of causal links between television and party dealignment (treatment vs. strategic effects, and cohort vs. short-term effects). Based on comparative research on industrial and new democracies, I present two contrasting hypotheses (television news inhibits partisanship; exposure to television creates political awareness) and test the impact of short-term treatment effects using a multinomial logit model. The results suggest that television news encourages party identification in the short run (through treatment effects), although the development of television may weaken Latin Amer-ican parties in the long run (through strategic effects). In recent years, students of Latin American politics have shown a growing interest in the political role of television. Different authors have claimed that press organizations and media technologies have become increasingly powerful and that they are weakening or replacing traditional political institutions. Main-waring and Scully (1995 : 471), for instance, suggested that "television has enabled candidates to make direct appeals to large parts of the population, potentially displacing party organizations as the primary means of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>out</b> to voters. " Other authors have even claimed that "the broadcast media are more powerful than the political parties " (Zuleta Puceiro 1993 : 61). This article presents results of tests {{to determine whether or not}} increasing exposure to television news is related to the erosion of political partisanship among citizens of eight Latin American countries. Until very recently, the paucity of comparative data on exposure to TV news and partisanship prevented the development of cross-national empirical studies on this topic.

2500|$|Although it {{has been}} {{estimated}} as having no more than 300 armed guerrilla members, the EZLN paralyzed the Mexican government, which balked at the political risks of direct confrontation. The major reason for this was that the rebellion caught the attention of the national and world press, as Marcos made full use of the then-new Internet to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> group's <b>message</b> <b>out,</b> putting <b>the</b> spotlight on indigenous issues in Mexico in general. Furthermore, the opposition press in Mexico City, especially La Jornada, actively supported the rebels. These factors encouraged the rebellion to go national. Many blamed the unrest on infiltration of leftists among the large Central American refugee population in Chiapas, and the rebellion opened up splits in the countryside between those supporting and opposing the EZLN. Zapatista sympathizers have included mostly Protestants and Word of God Catholics, opposing those [...] "traditionalist" [...] Catholics who practiced a syncretic form of Catholicism and indigenous beliefs. This split had existed in Chiapas since the 1970s, with the latter group supported by the caciques and others in the traditional power-structure. Protestants and Word of God Catholics (allied directly with the bishopric in San Cristóbal) tended to oppose traditional power structures.|$|R

Whilst it appears that we are collectively making progress in some areas, we acknowledge {{the need to improve}} our communication processes and practices to ´move to action´ in this regard. We need to extend the influence of the science and the knowledge beyond the documents to achieve effective impact and action. The training course will focus on <b>the</b> process of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> conservation <b>messages</b> <b>out</b> to a wider audience. This interactive and participatory training course will develop the skills and knowledge needed to communicate effective conservation messages for a range of IUCN internal and external audiences. The course will cover: • what is communication for conservation? • the communication planning process (developing your communication objectives) • identifying and understanding your target audiences • developing your conservation message • choosing your communication media and • evaluating the effectiveness of your communication strategies. A unique feature of the training course will be the use of Web 2. 0 tools in innovative conservation communications e. g. use of social media in concept branding and social marketing. In the spirit of the Forum´s objective of ´Sharing know how´, each participant will bring a current conservation issue to the training course and will leave with their own communication plan. Potentially, the training course adopts a cross-thematic approach as the issues addressed could be drawn from any of the IUCN´s program themes. Primarily though, the training course´s best fit is with the ´Valuing and Conserving Biodiversity´ theme since it will provide concrete and pragmatic solutions to enhancing the implementation of conservation measures through participatory planning and capacity building. ...|$|R

The aim of this research is to understand the factors and elements that have impacted upon the recovery of tourism businesses in the Victorian town of Marysville after these bushfires. The outcomes from this research will contribute to the existing disaster recovery literature and will provide recommendations to tourism businesses of Marysville, Victoria. The study consisted of semi-structured interviews ranging from 15 minutes to just over one hour. Twenty tourism businesses that had been affected by the bushfires in 2009 were chosen to participate as interviewees for the study. Five themes emerged from the 20 interviews. The five themes were media, infrastructure, economics and employment, trust and sense of community and communication. Based on the findings presented in Chapter Five, the following conclusions can be made: · There was a lack of forward recovery planning. · Tourism businesses experienced impacts on their business, mainly related to tourism recovery in the region. · Negative media attention, and not <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> right <b>message</b> <b>out,</b> impacted on tourism businesses and {{there was a lack of}} confidence that business would return to normal because of media and negative <b>messages.</b> · <b>The</b> right government assistance and right advertising can help tourism businesses in the recovery process.
