However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79. This <b>is</b> <b>five</b> years before Mons Graupius is believed by most historians to have taken place.|$|E

Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels.

5|$|Each Asia League Ice Hockey {{regulation}} game is an {{ice hockey}} game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game comprises three 20-minute periods separated by two 15 minute intermissions. While some teams have television broadcast contracts, {{they do not}} take television time-outs like the NHL. At {{the end of the}} 60 minute game, the team with the most goals wins. If the game is tied at the end of 60 minutes, the teams play an overtime period. Overtime <b>is</b> <b>five</b> minutes, with four skaters on each team. If the game remains tied after five minutes, then the teams partake in a three player shoot-out, until one team comes out ahead. Prior to the 2008–09 season these games ended in a tie with no shoot-out. In a playoff game the league doesn't use the shoot-out and instead the teams play continual overtime periods of 20 minutes until one team scores.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere <b>is</b> <b>five</b> times less than that in the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, {{mortality rates}} at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that <b>is,</b> <b>five</b> years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E
