Primary ambient metals contaminants of concern include, in order of higher concentration, iron, manganese, chromium, nickel, zinc, copper and lead. The U. S. Congress amended the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1990 to regulate and control specific hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that are known to cause adverse effects to human health. Metals represent eight of the HAPs that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) specifically identified as posing the greatest potential human health threat in urban areas. These metals include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, and nickel. While the existing regulations of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>foundries</b> work to limit HAP emissions, significant amounts of metals are still released from fugitive and stack emissions.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of Jacobs Engineering Groupâ€™s waste audit study of the thermal metal working industry, The goal {{of this study was to}} identify waste reduction techniques available to the industry. The report focuses on source reduction, recycling, and treatment methods for j businesses performing thermal metal working with specific focus on casting and heat treating. The processes examined include melting, mold and core making, shakeout, Land case hardening by means of thermal and/or chemical methods. Support operations which may be found at thermal metal working businesses, but have been explored in previous studies, include machining operations, metal parts cleaning and stripping, metal surface treatment and plating, and paint application. Three thermal metal working plants were surveyed as part of the project: a <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>foundry,</b> a heat treating plant and a non-ferrous foundry. Waste reduction and treatment techniques were identified and analyzed based on the information collected during these surveys, as well as from detailed literature review and discussions with industry representatives, The results include a waste reduction assessment format for generators to perform their own waste reduction opportunities assessments. Source reduction techniques, recycling and resource recovery techniques appear to offer high promise of minimizing waste generation. A waste reduction index was developed for use by foundries to measure waste reduction effectiveness. The index compensates for variation in production activity. Examples are developed here for brass foundry sand waste, iron foundry sand waste, and iron foundry baghouse waste. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. would like to acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Benjami...|$|R
40|$|Issue: <b>Ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> {{contaminants}} {{are common}} in post-consumer glass waste streams. However, enduse specifications frequently call for near zero levels of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> (see Specifications for Container Manufacturing and Specifications for Fiberglass Manufacturing Best Practices). <b>Ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> can cause damage to glass furnaces and production equipment. Also, many alternative uses for recycled glass cannot tolerate <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> because of chemical incompatibilities or because the <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> will oxidize over time. In addition to these manufacturing problems, larger pieces of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> may also damage crushing and screening equipment. Therefore, efficient and economical <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> removal is critical in glass processing. Best Practice: The positive characteristic of ferrous contamination is that these materials are magnetic and therefore can be detected and removed with the strategic use of magnetic separation technologies. Magnetic separation {{has been used in}} many material-handling applications for decades. Magnetic separators can be configured in numerous ways to meet the processing needs of any commodity. Two basic types of magnetic devices are electromagnets, which generate magnetic fields when power is applied, and permanent magnets, which self-generate a magnetic field. Magnets are configured for use in two primary ways: rotating, which work within a material stream to detect and segregate ferrou...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bottom ash {{contains}} many ferrous materials (e. g. <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> Fe 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, FeS). In addition, <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> include the heavy metals, as Ni and Cr have a chemical attraction to iron, with Cu used to coat with Ni and Cr metals for polishing or to prevent corrosion. For <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> {{the formation of}} a Fe 3 O 4 -Fe 2 O 3 double layer (similar to pure Fe) was found during air-annealing in an incinerator (1000 C). A strong thermal shock, such as that which takes place during water-cooling of bottom ash, leads to the breakdown of this oxidation layer, facilitating the degradation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> and the formation of corrosion products. Therefore, Fe-ion (heavy metal) oxides can be formed on <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> and magnetic separation can separate it from bottom ash. Thus, in this study the objection is to investigate the separation ratio of heavy metals by magnetic separation along with the mineralogical formation of Fe-ion (a heavy metal) ...|$|R

40|$|Issue: <b>Ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste supplies. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> are found in crates, pallets, and construction and demolition debris in the form of nails, screws, staples, or other hardware. These contaminants can create problems for the processor and end user alike. High value manufacturing feedstock specifications require that wood waste products be essentially free of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> contaminants. Removing <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> from wood waste is critical to wood waste recovery. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using magnetic separators to remove <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> from recovered wood waste. The following types of magnetic separation devices are described below: Stationary, Non Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: These are large permanent plate or electro-magnets designed to be suspended over a conveyor belt. These stationary, non self-cleaning magnets pull tramp metal out of wood waste as it passes underneath. To avoid excessive clean-up, the suspended magnets should be installed in areas where tramp metal volume is relatively small. So, they are generally inefficient for most applications at a wood waste processing facility. Since the overhead magnets work against gravity, they must be stronger than magnets underneath material flow. Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: A large permanent plate or electro-magnet.

40|$|M. Phil. (Natural Economics) Due to the {{overwhelming}} influence of gold {{on the national}} economy of South Africa, {{the importance of the}} other mineral resources are often underestimated. South Africa is the largest exporter of metals essential to the modern World industry - metals such as chrome, manganese and vanadium. Our vast reserves of these and other <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> might yet prove to provide this country with substantial political and economic powers in years to come. The importance of the availability of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> for the continued existence of the modern global civilization is not always realised. These metals, in the form of various steels and other alloys, form an integral part of our daily lives in modern communities. This important role and the numerous problems faced by the global <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> industry provided me with a challenging field of study. The phenomenon of cyclical volatility is inherent in mineral commodity markets and is eminently present in the markets for steel and related alloys, due mainly to the sensitivity of these markets to general economic welfare. In turn, and due to the derived demand relationship that exists between these metals and steel, the <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> are particularly susceptible to economic prosperity and depression. More often than not, a period of economic prosperity is characterised by <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> supply shortages, while excess supply is typical during periods of economic recession.

In 2000, DOE estimated that <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> currently in scrap yards within the DOE complex plus <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> expected from dismantling of obsolete facilities will amount to about one million tons. Approximately 60 percent of this metal {{is associated with the}} gaseous diffusion plants at Oak Ridge (K- 25 Site), Portsmouth and Paducah. Decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) is in progress at the K- 25 Site. Based on limited frequency distributions of metal surface assays, estimates are made in this chapter of the incremental quantities of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> associated with specific surface radioactivity levels. Approximately 78 percent of the 511, 000 tons of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> from D&D of the diffusion plants would have an activity of less than 4, 400 Bq/kg (120 pCi/g).
