In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, only Russula brevipes parasitized with Hypomyces lactifluorum—known as lobster mushroom—is {{collected}} commercially. The tropical Chinese species Russula griseocarnea, misidentified as the <b>European</b> <b>R.</b> vinosa until 2009, is commercially collected as food and medicine. Russula is the most commonly consumed and economically important mushroom genus in Madagascar, particularly Russula prolifica and Russula edulis. This and other edible Russula are typically stripped of their cap cuticle before selling {{to make them more}} similar in appearance to the Agaricus bisporus. Several Russula species are sold in the markets of Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park (central Mexico): R. brevipes, R. cyanoxantha, R. mexicana and R. olivacea. In Tlaxcala, wild species sold in market include R. alutacea, R. cyanoxantha, R. delica, R. mariae, R. olivacea, R. romagnesia, and R. xerampelina. In Madagascar, species collected from introduced eucalypt forests include Russula madecassense, Russula prolifica, and several other species of minor importance, including some that have not yet been officially described. In Tanzania, Russula cellulata and Russula ciliata are sometimes used as food. Edible russulas in Nepal include Russula flavida and Russula chlorides. Russula cyanoxantha is a popular edible throughout Asia, Europe, and the Pacific. In Thailand, russulas collected by locals and sold in roadsides and local markets include Russula alboareolata, Russula lepida, Russula nigricans, Russula virescens, and Russula xerampelina. There is a cultural divide toward interpretation of Russula edibility. In general, North American field guides tend to list mostly non-edible species and advise caution when consuming any member of the genus. In contrast, European field guides have a more favorable opinion and list more edible species.|$|E

The results also display that assumptions strongly influences the outcome. Depending on the interpretation of how many “children” are kept from “school”, R 0 changes from a range where outbreak progression is possible to a range where it is improbable in both <b>European</b> (<b>R</b> 0 = 1. 77 / 1. 23) and Asian (R 0 = 1. 70 / 1. 05) conditions.

The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the utility of patent indicators for the evaluation of EC research programmes. The work comprises a critical review of the respective literature and the exemplary evaluation of selected EC programmes as well.

For their evaluation, a standard set of patent indicators mostly derived from data of the European Patent Office (EPO) was defined. All in all, patent indicators can reveal the structures of R and D performance on a world-wide and an EC-level so that assumes disparities can be checked. A problem concerning the direct evaluation of programme results is the limited amount of the programme budgets compared to the <b>European</b> <b>R</b> and D activities in the total respective field.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} home base augmenting (HBA) R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D and home base exploiting (HBE) R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D. It has three novelties. First, we argue that any given R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D facility’s capacity to exploit and/or augment technological competences is a function not just of its own resources, but the efficiency with which it can utilise complementary resources associated with the relevant local innovation system. Just as HBA activities require proximity to the economic units (and thus the innovation system) from which they seek to learn, HBE activities draw from the parent’s technological resources {{as well as from}} the other assets of home location’s innovation system. Furthermore, we argue that most firms tend to undertake both HBE and HBA activities simultaneously. Second, we use patent citation data from the European Patent Office to quantify the relative HBA vs. HBE character of foreign-located R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D. Third, we do so for European MNEs located in the US, as well as US MNEs located in Europe. Our results indicate that both EU (US) affiliates in the US (EU) rely extensively on home region knowledge sources, although they appear to exploit the host country knowledge base as well.

40|$|Human Y-chromosome haplogroup {{structure}} is largely circumscribed by continental boundaries. One notable {{exception to this}} general pattern is the young haplogroup R 1 a that exhibits post-Glacial coalescent times and relates the paternal ancestry of more than 10 % of men in a wide geographic area extending from South Asia to Central East Europe and South Siberia. Its origin and dispersal patterns are poorly understood as no marker has yet been described that would distinguish <b>European</b> <b>R</b> 1 a chromosomes from Asian. Here we present frequency and haplotype diversity estimates for more than 2000 R 1 a chromosomes assessed for several newly discovered SNP markers that introduce the onset of informative R 1 a subdivisions by geography. Marker M 434 has a low frequency and a late origin in West Asia bearing witness to recent gene flow over the Arabian Sea. Conversely, marker M 458 has a significant frequency in Europe, exceeding 30 % in its core area in Eastern Europe and comprising up to 70 % of all M 17 chromosomes present there. The diversity and frequency profiles of M 458 suggest its origin during the early Holocene and a subsequent expansion likely related {{to a number of}} prehistoric cultural developments in the region. Its primary frequency and diversity distribution correlates well with some of the major Central and East European river basins where settled farming was established before its spread further eastward. Importantly, the virtual absence of M 458 chromosomes outside Europe speaks against substantial patrilineal gene flow from East Europe to Asia, including to India, at least since the mid-Holocene...|$|E
40|$|For {{very high}} rate and {{resolution}} time resolved experiments at next generation pulsed spallation neutron sources like ESS large area hybrid low pressure micro strip gas chamber detectors are being developed. Due to their thin composite converter foil and exponential gas multiplication commencing at the converter surfaces the detectors {{are free of}} parallax, and according to detailed modeling the very high transverse and longitudinal localization accuracies in the conversion and gas multiplication processes allow position and time resolutions of 100 m and lt; 10 ns FWHM for thermal neutrons, respectively, the latter limited by the transit time through the converter. In the <b>European</b> <b>R</b> amp;D project TECHNI for this detector an advanced delay line readout technology with multi event readout was developed as an economical solution {{for the majority of}} applications, which, however, limits the position resolution and rate capability to lt; 0. 3 mm and 1 2 Mcps, respectively.

40|$|The {{continually}} growing demands {{over the}} quality of the environment, followed by the progressive legislation aimed at controlling pollutants, have created a need for a further development of the engine design and the exhaust gas after treatment systems as well. In order to achieve extensive reduction of the pollutants and appropriate engine performance, an optimization of an ethanol fueled version of the Volvo TD 73 diesel engine was performed based on a computerized analysis of measured engine parameters. A back pressure regulator (ATR) is mounted on the turbocharger outlet; therefore the engine was forced to work against a back pressure, particularly at light loads where the emission levels are expected to be undesirable. Hence, by reducing air intake, an increase of cylinder gas temperature was certainly expected and a continuous decline in emissions with increase of back pressure was obtained. Furthermore, the effect of a by-pass valve, installed between intercooler and intake manifold, on emission levels were investigated and optimized. Oxidation catalysts effects on regulated emissions, especially unburned fuel, carbon monoxide and unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were investigated. In correlation with the back pressure regulator, a promoting faster catalyst Warm-up was achieved, and their conversion efficiencies were improved. In order to gain more extensive information to base specification of the engine emissions and catalyst selection, different test cycles such as <b>European</b> <b>R</b> 49 - 13 mode, steady state adoption of the Braunschweig cycle, 24 specific steps cycle, as well as conditioning, activating and transient cycles were used.

40|$|Rubus canduliger is {{described}} as a new regional bramble species belonging to the series Discolores. It has been recognized in the Netherlands as a distinct species for more than 70 years but identified as the central <b>European</b> <b>R.</b> grabowskii. The latter, however, differs by its tapering prickles, regular leaves with longer petiolule of the terminal leaflet, broader, often pyramidal inflorescence, and white or pink flowers with carpels hairy at the top. R. canduliger has a well-defined range north of the Rhine river around Arnhem where it occurs in urban and other disturbed habitats. Historical events, e. g. transport of young trees in the 16 th century may explain most records south of the Rhine river, 25 ¿ 50 km outside the main range. The ecology and phytosociology of the new bramble are discussed. Its distribution is compared to R. trichanthus, another regional species with a similar range as R. canduliger, but occurring in more natural habitats. In pseudogamous European blackberries (Rubus section Rubus = R. fruticosus agg.), range size is considered {{to be related to the}} age of the species. Several widespread species have disjunct distribution ranges that are suggested to be the result of long-distance dispersal by migratory birds but unintentional anthropogenic transport of seeds may be involved as well. We hypothesize that in northwestern Europe fragmentation of continuous ranges of widespread species was caused by ongoing deforestation and subsequent degradation (acidification) of originally base-rich sandy and loamy soils from the Iron Age onward. Many regional species, however, have originated and spread in the resulting man-made landscapes.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences were generated from Rhipicephalus sanguineus group specimens collected in 29 localities among 9 Latin-American countries, plus ticks collected in South Africa, Spain, and Italy. Sequences from Latin America generated six different haplotypes (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Phylogenetic analyses generated trees that segregated our tick sequences into two distinct clades: one {{is represented by}} haplotypes A-C, and South African R. sanguineus and Rhipicephalus turanicus ticks; the second clade is represented by haplotypes D-F, and <b>European</b> <b>R.</b> sanguineus and R. turanicus ticks. When haplotypes A-Fare plotted in the Latin America map according to their geographical coordinates, it is clearly seen that haplotypes D-F are restricted to the southern portion of this continent, whereas haplotypes A-C are distributed in areas between northern Mexico and Brazil (except for the extreme south of this last country, where haplotype E was present). Hence, our phylogenetic analyses separated New World specimens of R. sanguineus into two distinct clades, one represented by tropical and subtropical populations (haplotypes A-C), here designated as the `tropical` species. On the other hand, haplotypes D-F are here designated as the `temperate` species because of their distribution in the southern portion of South America. Until recently, {{it was assumed that}} the R. sanguineus group was represented by a single species in the New World, namely R. sanguineus. While the present results coupled with recent studies support the presence of at least two species under the taxon R. sanguineus in the New World, they also show that even in the Old World, the taxon R. sanguineus might be represented by more than one species, since our phylogenetic analysis segregated European and South African R. sanguineus ticks into two distinct clades. The same can be applied for Spanish and South African R. turanicus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
