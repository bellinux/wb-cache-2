50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the Wellington Acclimatization Society had a trout-rearing pond on the northern bank of the Hutt River near where Clarke's Creek entered the Hutt River, just downstream of the first Akatarawa Road bridge. The water for this pond was taken from Clarke's Creek. In 1912, civil engineer G. Laing-Meason proposed a water supply scheme to the Upper Hutt Town Board that involved constructing a weir further up Clarke's Creek and piping the water to Upper Hutt and as far as Silverstream. Construction commenced in 1913 and was completed by February 1914. The Minister of Public Works officially opened the water supply scheme on 28 February 1914. Although G. Laing-Meason had initially proposed an option using 10 <b>inch</b> <b>pipes</b> and a 100,000 gallon reservoir, to allow for extending the water supply as far as the Silverstream Bridge. The constructed scheme only used 8 <b>inch</b> <b>pipes</b> and a 50,000 gallon reservoir. By the mid-1920s, Upper Hutt residents were complaining that there was inadequate water pressure and the now Upper Hutt Borough Council began refusing to supply water to Hutt County residents just outside the borough boundaries in Heretaunga and Pinehaven.|$|R

50|$|As the British {{war machine}} pushed on across the Sinai Peninsula the {{infrastructure}} and supporting British garrisons strongly held all the territory they occupied. By {{the end of}} February 1917, 388 miles of railway (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), 203 miles of metalled road, 86 miles of wire and brushwood roads and 300 miles of water pipeline had been constructed. The pipeline required three huge pumping plants working 24 hours a day at Kantara, near a reservoir of 6,000,000 gallons. For local use, the pumps forced the water through 5 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> to Dueidar, through a 6 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> to Pelusium, Romani and Mahemdia and through a 12 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> the main supply was pushed across the desert from pumping station to pumping station. At Romani a concrete reservoir contained a further 6,000,000 gallons, at Bir el Abd 5,000,000 and at Mazar 500,000 and another of 500,000 at El Arish. And with railhead at Rafa, Gaza was by then just twenty miles away, five to six hours for infantry and mounted units at a walk and 2 hours distant for horses at a trot.|$|E

40|$|Upon the {{enactment}} by the United States Congress of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, it became mandatory that all water closets in {{residential and commercial}} settings reduce the volume of water that they consume per flush. In 1994, after installations began of the new low-flush or low-flow water closets that used {{less than half the}} water that their predecessors used, many owners of the new plumbing fixtures began to complain that their performance was sub par. Many complained about plumbing backups and of complete bowl clearance problems. There have been studies conducted to evaluate the new water closets? bowl evacuation properties. This study focuses on what happens to the solid waste that is flushed through the water closet after leaving the bowl, namely how far the solid media is transported down waste piping. The main focus {{of this study is to}} compare the performance of the low-flush, 1. 6 gallons (6 liters) per flush water closets with the performance of the formerly standard flush 3. 5 gallons (13 liters) per flush in regards to how far they transport solid waste through waste lines. It was found that the media flushed through the high volume water closets traveled significantly farther that the media flushed through the low-flush water closets. It was often more than double the average distance. It was also found that media traveled farther down pipes composed of PVC than those composed of cast iron and also traveled farther down three <b>inch</b> <b>pipes</b> than four <b>inch</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{artificial}} ice {{was constructed}} by laying {{several layers of}} waterproof paper and wool. On top of this was built a 4-inch tall watertight pan, which held the water.

50|$|At full power, sodium at a {{temperature}} of approximately 500 F passed through a plenum chamber beneath the reactor core through the heat channels absorbing heat released from the fuel elements, and discharged into the upper pool (about 6 ft deep) above the core at an average temperature of 950 °F (510 °C). This space was filled with helium gas, maintained at a pressure of approximately three pounds per square <b>inch.</b> <b>Piping</b> circulated 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) of heated liquid sodium from the reactor vessel {{to one of two}} available heat exchangers. One heat exchanger transferred heat from the primary sodium loop, which in turn dissipated the heat in a steam generator which boiled water to make steam for use in a turbine generating electricity.|$|R

50|$|Alternately if moving sink to {{an island}} sink, install the P-trap below {{the floor of the}} island and vent {{off the top of the}} drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to {{existing}} vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g. 1.25 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.|$|E
5000|$|Pipe sizes can be {{confusing}} because the terminology {{may relate to}} historical dimensions. For example, a half-inch iron pipe {{does not have any}} dimension that is a half inch. Initially, a half <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> did have an inner diameter of 0.5 in—but it also had thick walls. As technology improved, thinner walls became possible, but the outside diameter stayed the same so it could mate with existing older pipe, increasing the inner diameter beyond half an inch. The history of copper pipe is similar. In the 1930s, the pipe was designated by its internal diameter and a 1/16 in wall thickness. Consequently, a 1 in copper pipe had a 1+1/8 in outside diameter. The outside diameter was the important dimension for mating with fittings. The wall thickness on modern copper is usually thinner than 1/16 in, so the internal diameter is only [...] "nominal" [...] rather than a controlling dimension. [...] Newer pipe technologies sometimes adopted a sizing system as its own. PVC pipe uses the Nominal Pipe Size.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A 4 inch {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> with 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD tool joints because the tool joints for 4 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and tool joint and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / 4 inch OD tool joints are usually welded to 4 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe.</b> A 5 inch OD tool joint is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A 4 inch drill pipe assembly with a 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD tool joint has been developed that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> <b>pipe</b> such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. ! The results of finite element analysis on the tool joint. ! Full-scale lab testing of the tool joint. ! Case histories of similar assemblies. Drill String Design.
