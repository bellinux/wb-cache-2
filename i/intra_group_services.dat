40|$|This master’s thesis has {{analyzed}} the issues multinational enterprises (MNE) have when determining the arm’s length price from <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> <b>services</b> rendered {{from a group}} service center (GSC). The thesis {{is based on the}} recommendations from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the legislations in Sweden, Germany, USA, and Denmark. There are several factors that could cause issues for services rendered from a GSC. GSCs render services to the members of a MNE. These types of services are often managerial, supervisory, marketing, or other kinds of services, which are preformed more efficiently if centralized in the MNE rather than if each member of the MNE would perform the services themselves. The research has shown three specific issues that have caused problems for MNEs: When is a service chargeable? Is the applied method for charging appropriate? And, how should the remuneration be determined? The concerned countries have different rules and regulations towards dealing with these issues, which have caused problems for MNE operating in these countries. There is no other category of transaction that has caused as much disagreement between taxpayers and tax authorities as <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> <b>services.</b> Countries seem to have different approaches towards when services are chargeable, which in situations create disputes between taxpayers and the countries’ tax authorities. The appropriate method for charging is dependent of the concerned countries. Three of the countries have a negative attitude towards indirect charging, while one has no preference. Consequently, this has caused problems for MNE to price services. Three of the countries apply the OECD’s recommendations, when determine the appropriate pricing method. OECD has a hierarchy of the methods, whereas USA applies the best method rule, which means that they have no preference over a certain pricing method. The most common methods for pricing services are the cost plus method and the transactional net margin method. However, there are situations where some of the countries do not approve a profit element in the charge. In these situations, the OECD‘s recommendations do not provide a clear and straight answer, whereas the US Regulations have very strict and clear regulations when a service should be charged without a profit element. There could be many factors to why countries have different interpretations: ambiguous recommendations from the OECD; subjective opinions from governments, tax authorities and courts; protectionism; language barriers; accounting standards; the differences in the legal value of the OECD recommendations; and probably other factors which has not been considered. Inferentially, the OECD should be more open to a “US approach”, by giving more clear, precise and direct recommendations. A “US approach” gives more predictability to practitioners. Direct, clear and precise recommendations will give less room for interpretation, thus, less confusion in practice. Even if this has to be accepted by countries it should lead to less confusion and hopefully decrease double taxation for MNEs...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{bone mass}} estimation, through imaging methods, {{is widely used}} in metabolic"ndiseases {{diagnosis}} and treatment. One of these methods is called &quot;optical densitometry&quot; which estimates bone density by measuring {{the intensity of the}} transmitted light on different parts of a radiographic image. Digital radiography systems act similarly by determining grey levels of the image. The aim of this study is comparing two different methods of optical densitometry and a digital system densitometry known as radiovisiography. 45 samples, containing urografin with three different concentrations, were imaged, by both radiovisiogrphy (RVG) and conventional film systems. To determine the densitometry of films and radiovisiography images, optical densitometry and bone densitometry option of the RVG software, were applied respectively. Data were analyzed and compared for their reliability (repeatability) and correlations with concentration. In RVG densitometry system, the correlation with concentration is moderate (r= 0. 42) and intra samples and <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> reliability are 97. 68 % and 88. 19 %. Moreover, in conventional optical film densitometry, correlation with concentration (r= 0. 987) is high, intra samples and <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> reliability is high, intra samples and <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> reliability are 99. 97 % and 99. 84 %, respectively. According to the results, it is suggested that conventional film optical densitometry is more precise and reliable than RVG densitometry...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare posttransplantation {{morbidity}} and mortality in orthotopic heart transplant recipients bridged to transplant with a left ventricular assist device with nonbridged recipients. To account for potential differences across device types, we stratified bridge-to-transplant recipients by type of ventricular assist device: extracorporeal (EXTRA), paracorporeal (PARA), and intracorporeal (INTRA). MethodsThe United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified patient-level data. The study population included 10, 668 orthotopic heart transplant recipients aged 18 years old or older and undergoing transplantation between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006. Follow-up data were provided through August 3, 2008, with a mean follow-up time of 3. 17 ± 2. 15 years (range, 0 – 8. 11 years). The primary outcome was actuarial posttransplant graft survival. Other outcomes of interest included infection, stroke, and dialysis during the transplant hospitalization; primary graft failure at 30 days; transplant hospitalization length of stay; and long-term complications including diabetes mellitus, transplant coronary artery disease, and chronic dialysis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (backward, P <. 15) was used to determine the relationship between groups and overall graft survival, and multivariable logistic regression analysis (backward, P <. 15) was used to determine the relationship between groups and secondary outcome measures. ResultsIn multivariable Cox regression analysis, when compared with the nonbridged group, risk-adjusted greater than 90 -day graft survival was diminished among the EXTRA group (hazard ratio = 3. 54, 2. 28 – 5. 51, P <. 001), but not the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group</b> (1. 04, 0. 719 – 1. 51, P =. 834) or the PARA group (1. 06, 0. 642 – 1. 76, P =. 809). There were no significant differences in risk-adjusted graft survival across the 4 groups during the 90 -days to 1 -year or 1 - to 5 -year intervals. However, at more than 5 years, risk-adjusted graft survival in the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group</b> (0. 389, 0. 205 – 0. 738, P =. 004) was better than in the nonbridged group. The EXTRA, PARA, and <b>INTRA</b> <b>groups</b> all experienced increased risks of infection. The EXTRA group had increased risks of dialysis, stroke, and primary graft failure at 30 days, whereas neither the PARA nor the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group</b> differed from the nonbridged group. Long-term complications did not differ by group. ConclusionThe use of implantable left ventricular assist devices as bridges to transplantation, including both intracorporeal and paracorporeal devices, is not associated with diminished posttransplant survival. However, 90 -day survival was diminished in recipients bridged with extracorporeal devices...|$|R
40|$|A survey af the {{cultural}} and linguistic adaptation of 76 married Japanese women in New Zealand {{was carried out by}} means of interviews and language tests. Two basic sub-groups were identified: those who were married to Japanese husbands (INTRA subjects) and those who were interculturally married (INTER subjects). A number of marked differences, in particular those related to age and marriage type, were observed to exist between these <b>INTRA</b> and INTER <b>groups.</b> The INTER subjects appeared to have made a smoother cultural adaptation to life in New Zealand than those in the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group.</b> The <b>INTRA</b> subjects all identified themselves culturally as Japanese as did the more recently arrived INTER subjects. However, some of the INTER group who had lived in New Zealand for many years appeared to have a cultural identity which was neither fully Japanese nor western. The migrants continued to maintain the Japanese language for communicating among themselves although it {{did not seem to be}} passed on to the children of the INTER subjects. A considerable shift from Japanese to English was observed among the INTER subjects but was less evident among subjects in the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group.</b> Levels of oral proficiency in English were not particularly high among the subjects, ranging between 0 + and 3 + on the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) assessment scale. Most of the <b>INTRA</b> <b>group</b> were assessed between level 0 + and 1 + on the scale whereas the majority of INTER subjects scored between levels 2 and 3 +. This difference in oral proficiency was due mainly to influences associated with intercultural marriage. An analysis of the subjects' oral English revealed that the INTRA subjects had higher frequencies of error in their English than the INTER subjects. Many phonological errors appeared to be due to interference from Japanese. An analysis of grammatical errors involving noun morphology, verb morphology and article usage, however, suggested several possible causes of error including interference, oversimplification, the learners' false hypotheses, faulty instruction and idiosyncratic variation. The nature and frequency of these errors resulted in pidginlike characteristics being observed in the subjects' English. Lexical errors and communication strategies employed by the subjects were also described...|$|R

In this paper, Centroid Based Transformation (CBT), {{has been applied}} to decompose the combined dynamics of nonholonomic Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) into three subsystems: <b>intra</b> and inter <b>group</b> shape dynamics, and the dynamics of the centroid. The <b>intra</b> <b>group</b> shape dynamics can further be partitioned into the shape dynamics of each group, giving the notion of multiple group. Thus separate controllers have been designed for each subsystem. The gains of the controllers are such chosen that the overall system becomes singularly perturbed system, and different subsystems converge to their desired values at different times. Then multi-time scale convergence analysis has been carried out in this paper. Negative gradient of a potential based function has been added to the controller to ensure collision avoidance among the robots. Simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1412. 616...|$|R
