25|$|The queen was {{designed}} by Cameron in collaboration with special effects artist Stan Winston, based upon an initial painting Cameron had done {{at the start of}} the project. The Winston Studio created a test foam core queen before constructing the full hydraulic puppet which was used for most of the scenes involving the large Alien. Two people were <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> the twin sets of arms, and puppeteers off-screen worked its jaws and head. Although at the end of the film, the queen was presented full-body fighting the power-loader, the audience never sees the legs of the queen, save those of the small-scale puppet that appears only briefly. In Aliens, Cameron used very selective camera-angles on the queen, using the '' style of photography. Subsequently, the movie won an Oscar for Visual Effects. An adult queen was to reappear in Alien Resurrection. The original mechanical head previously used in Aliens was provided by Bob Burns and was an altered design. It was repainted with a blend of green and brown, giving it a shimmering, insect-like quality. This color concept would be abandoned in Alien vs. Predator in favour of the original black color scheme.|$|E

And herewith was unfolded a history so dark in its bloody regime, so incredible in its brazen daring, so appalling in its proof of the outlaw's sweep and grasp of the country from Pecos to Rio Grande, that Duane was stunned. Compared to this Cheseldine of the Big Bend, to this rancher, stock-buyer, cattle-speculator, property-holder, all the outlaws Duane had ever known sank into insignificance. The power of the man stunned Duane; the strange fidelity given him stunned Duane; the intricate <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> of his great system was equally stunning.

5000|$|Several {{inches of}} {{insulation}} must {{be added to}} the <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> diameter to get the diameter of the pressure vessel. Putting the insulation on the outside yields the smallest pressure vessel for a given <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> diameter, but the energy required to heat up the vessel itself each cycle soon makes this a very unattractive way of economizing, unless steam injection is used for heating, in which event external insulation must be used. For most machines, figure on four to six inches of insulation thickness.

The capital center tower has about 1,000 people <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> every week and about 400 offices. A 26-story skyscraper, it was the tallest structure in South Carolina from its completion in December 1987 to {{the completion of the}} Prysmian Copper Wire Tower in Abbeville in 2009. The tower was built {{on the site of the}} former Wade Hampton Hotel which was imploded in July 1985. This modern building exterior is finished in double-paned tinted glass with horizontal bands of anodized aluminum color panels. The 25-story tower was completed in 1987 during a Columbia high-rise building boom, as the AT&T Building. Naming rights have been previously held by Affinity and South Trust Bank. The current signage on the building is held by BB&T Bank. During its construction in 1986, gubernatorial candidate Carroll Campbell successfully used the then unfinished structure, whose construction was partially financed by the State of South Carolina, as a symbol for excessive government spending.|$|E

The Ballet Associate Course has been developed to offer master classes for young ballet students in a workshop format though the year. The Scholar's Programme is a pre-professional training outgrowth of Ballet Associates that gives students daily training in development towards careers in dance. SDT has also launched a children's series with ballets made especially for very young audiences accompanied by a narrator. These efforts aim to make dance more accessible to the masses.

5000|$|The Springfield Telescope Makers {{grew out}} of a class on how to make telescopes that was started by Russell W. Porter in Springfield, Vermont in August 12, 1920. The members of this small group decided to form a club and held their first meeting on December 7, 1923. The Stellafane clubhouse was built in 1924 on a 30 acre plot {{belonging}} to Porter on the 1270 ft summit of Breezy Hill outside of town. The original 20 x 24 ft clubhouse (with an 11 x 13 ft ell added in 1926) included a meeting room, a kitchen, a workshop, and bunkrooms on the second floor. The building incorporated a polar Cassegrain telescope, a transit telescope (no longer functional), a solar telescope, and a sundial, on the south wall. The name Stellafane (originally suggested by Porter at the club's January 1924 meeting) comes from the Latin words stella meaning star, and fane meaning shrine which together means [...] "Shrine to the Stars". Besides the historic Stellafane [...] "pink clubhouse," [...] the site includes Porter's uniquely designed Turret Telescope, a 12 in f/17 Newtonian reflector that was completed in 1931. This telescope consists of an equatorially rotated concrete dome with the telescope mounted on the outside, with the observer on the <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> in heated comfort. Stellafane is still the location where the Springfield Telescope Makers hold most of their meetings. The clubhouse and the observatory housing Porter's telescope were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989, in recognition for the club's pioneering role in the popularization of astronomy and the amateur construction of telescopes.|$|E

Manual transport as a transport <b>inside</b> <b>working</b> place is related to foundry industry. According to polish lawregulations employer has to give consideration to manual handling in professional risk assessment and introduce actions for manualhandling reduction. In Foundry Elblag case there is found that in many processes manual handling are made by workers. For example wecan choose melting processes (additives manual feeding, mixing and pulling metallurgical slag, etc.) or fettling processes like grinding. Objective of that analysis was to define level of risk related to manual handling in work stand chosen and define activities impacted onrisk assessment result with biggest range. For risk reduction, technical and organizational solutions were shown (better ergonomically work stand, method of work and worker’s awareness about good practices). In this study methods related to manual handling risk assessment were described, focus on KIM method used in Foundry Elblag. Key Item Method allow to estimate the risk by simple calculation based on key indicators (time rating points, rating points of mass, posture or work condition). Points were chosen based on timekeeping, information from workers and foreman...|$|E

The structure of the outflow is interpreted as a direct representation of the organ-ism’s response to its environment. Therefore, we examine how the work performed by an organism’s feeding apparatus is altered according to environ-mental factors and metabolic demands. Our approac...|$|E
