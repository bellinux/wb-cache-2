That street was named {{after the death of}} James J. Couzens. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is said not to have accepted a salary, giving <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.|$|E

25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots {{are the best}} known of these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike.

Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area.

The song reached its highest international chart peak position in the Irish Singles Chart, at number seventeen.

Cyrus promoted the song by performing it in several venues, including during the opening act for the Cheetah Girls' The Party's Just Begun Tour and as the closing number on her own first headlining concert tour of the same name. Cyrus' performances of the song on the Best of Both Worlds Tour were as herself, but when she performed the song on television, she did so in character as Hannah Montana.|$|E

Charlton manager Alan Curbishley said of his opponents: [...] "The gulf between Arsenal {{and the rest of}} the Premier League means that the rest have got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> do to try and stop them, and I'm {{including}} the big three or four." [...] Two goals from Pirès and one from Henry ensured a 3–1 win against Aston Villa, who had led the game early on. Attention soon turned to Arsenal's trip to face Manchester United. The champions were looking to go half a century of league games unbeaten, whereas the home team – in transition, attempted to push on for a title challenge. In the match, a challenge by Sol Campbell on Wayne Rooney earned Manchester United a penalty, converted by Ruud van Nistelrooy in the 73rd minute. Rooney then scored United's second goal of the match to end Arsenal's unbeaten run on 49 games. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel, where pizza was thrown at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. When speaking to the media, a distraught Wenger told reporters that Rooney dived to win the penalty and criticised the refereeing performance of Mike Riley. He was later found guilty of insinuating that Van Nistelrooy was a cheat, and fined £15,000 by the FA.|$|E
