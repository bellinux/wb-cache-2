5|$|Tara K. Allen, {{arguing for}} Alvarado, {{claimed that the}} state court's {{decision}} was objectively unreasonable {{because they did not}} consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane. Specifically, the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective test and subjective <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} myelin starts {{inflammatory}} processes, which triggers other immune cells {{and the release}} of soluble <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> cytokines and antibodies. Further breakdown of the blood–brain barrier in turn causes a number of other damaging effects such as swelling, activation of macrophages, and more activation of cytokines and other destructive proteins. Inflammation can potentially reduce transmission of information between neurons in at least three ways. The soluble factors released might stop neurotransmission by intact neurons. These factors could lead to or enhance the loss of myelin, or they may cause the axon to break down completely.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities {{may be influenced by}} <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating <b>factors</b> <b>like</b> the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceProximal deep venous {{thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism should be treated {{for at least three}} months. The optimal duration then depends on the cause of venous thromboembolism (VTE). When VTE is provoked by a major transient risk <b>factor</b> <b>like</b> surgery, three month treatment dura- tion is sufficient. When VTE is provoked by a persistent major risk <b>factor</b> <b>like</b> cancer, treatment should be prolonged as long as the underlying risk-factor is present. The optimal treatment duration is more difficult to define after an episode of unprovoked VTE and when VTE is triggered by a minor risk <b>factor</b> <b>like</b> travel or oral contraceptives. In these circumstances, the risk of recur- rent VTE is still high after six months of anticoagulant treatment. Prolonging the anticoagulant treatment for an additional period of 12 to 24 months after the initial period of 6 months is associated with delayed recurrences but does not reduce the overall risk of recurrent VTE. In these patients, treatment should be stopped at six months or prolonged indefinitively according to the risks of recurrence and bleeding of the patient...|$|R
