5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved <b>in</b> <b>ongoing</b> domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} engaged <b>in</b> <b>ongoing</b> {{negotiations to}} establish {{conditions under which}} {{free and fair elections}} could be held to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in Maputo, Mozambique. The Maputo Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral political decisions and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest <b>in</b> <b>ongoing</b> research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the turmoil}} of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been {{gradually}} to implement austerity measures, {{with the purpose of}} lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. To further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed to adopt the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved <b>in</b> <b>ongoing</b> bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout programme (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) was asked both to follow a programme with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states.|$|E
