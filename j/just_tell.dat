25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{she was a}} {{supporting}} actress in Airport 1975. Loy played Mrs. Devane, a heavy-drinking woman, imbibing Jim Beam and Olympia Beer mixed together. She played a foil to Sid Caesar. The film also starred Gloria Swanson. In 1978, she appeared in the film The End {{as the mother of}} the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> Me What You Want. She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E

25|$|While {{directing}} The Outlaw, Hughes became {{fixated on}} a small flaw in one of Jane Russell's blouses, claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast. He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. Richard Fleischer, who directed His Kind of Woman with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty {{of dealing with the}} tycoon. In his book, <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> Me When to Cry, Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz {{later called}} Kobold, the episode's main antagonist, [...] "the devil, in a cell." [...] When {{creating}} Kobold, Spotnitz researched various crimes and criminals, {{until he came}} across the name of Caryl Chessman, who had been sentenced to death on a technical charge of kidnapping. He was then able to connect the word [...] "chessman" [...] to the idea that, for Kobold, his crimes were all a game. Spotnitz wanted the villain to be a character that [...] "could help", and not a character that would <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> the viewers [...] "what The X-Files was again".|$|E

The song was covered, for example, by Game Theory, and included as a bonus track on the CD release of Real Nighttime (1985). The 2010 book [...] called the song [...] "likely the greatest power pop recording ever made," [...] with lyrics [...] "somehow both desperate and lighthearted at the same time," [...] and a guitar solo having [...] "truly amazing dexterity and inflection." ...|$|E

Hall remarked in 2010, [...] "If I don't do the game in the next 10 years, I'll just write {{up the rest of the}} story and put it on my website for closure, how about that?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Død Kalm" [...] {{received}} mostly mixed to moderately positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Død Kalm" [...] a B, noting that, [...] "Despite clumsy makeup, isolation {{pays off}} again, and Mulder and Scully get {{to try a}} little tenderness." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club, despite noting his original dislike for the episode, awarded it a B rating and wrote, [...] "This episode works, almost in spite of itself. There are so many nice little moments here [...] it's a script that pauses from the constant horror the show had been serving up for several episodes in a row to <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> an unsettling, ultimately moving tale of two friends who look into the abyss and somehow don't fall." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film three stars out of four, {{describing}} the revelation {{at the end}} a [...] "fundamental flaw" [...] and a [...] "cheat." [...] He wrote, [...] "The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two." [...] R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, [...] "I love a good science fiction story; <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> me in advance." [...] He gave the film a B-. Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was [...] "'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'" ...|$|E

In a win over [...] on January 2, 2005, he replaced Sammy Mejía and scored nine points for his best scoring performance of the season.

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
