5000|$|Qualitatively, this {{basically}} {{states that}} the relative amount of non-renewable resources decreases, the amount capital required to extract the resources increases. To more deeply examine this table requires examining the equation that it comes from, effective_output = industrial_capital*other_factors*(1-fcaor) So, if industrial capital and the other factors (described in the capital sector) are the same, then 1 unit of the effective capital when nrfr is 1.0 the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 0.95 (= 1.0 * ( [...] 1 - 0.05)). So, when nrfr is 0.5, the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 0.90 (= 1.0 * (1 - 0.10)). Another useful {{way to look at}} this equation is to reverse it and see how much effective capital is required to get 1 unit of <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> (i.e. effective_output / (1 - fcaor) = effective_capital). So, when nrfr is 1.0, the effective capital required for 1 unit of <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> is 1.053 (=1.0/(1-0.05)), and when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2 (=1.0/(1-0.5)). Lastly is looking at the relative cost required for obtaining the resources. This {{based on the fact that}} it requires 1/19 of a unit of effective capital extra when the nrfr is 1.0. So, (effective capital required - 1.0) / (1 / 19) will give the relative cost of obtaining the resources compared to the cost of obtaining them when nrfr was 1.0. For example, when nrfr is 0.3, the effective capital required is 2.0, and 1.0 of that is for obtaining resources. So, the cost of obtaining the resources is (2.0 - 1.0) / ( [...] 1 / 19) or 1.0*19 or 19 times the cost when nrfr was 1.0. Here is a table showing these calculations for all the values: ...|$|E

50|$|Masking of high {{frequency}} tinnitus (>6,000hz) {{is difficult because}} of the resonance characteristics of the human ear as well as {{high frequency}} limitations of in-ear devices. The ear has a resonance frequency (highest frequency response) at 3,000hz and rolls off at a very steep 26db/octave on the high frequency side.

5000|$|Note {{that because}} the control law is not continuous, it is {{certainly}} not locally Lipschitz continuous, and so existence and uniqueness of solutions to the closed-loop system is not guaranteed by the Picard-Lindelöf theorem. Thus the solutions are to be understood in the Filippov sense. Roughly speaking, the resulting closed-loop system moving along [...] is approximated by the smooth dynamics [...] however, this smooth behavior may not be truly realizable. Similarly, high-speed pulse-width modulation or delta-sigma modulation produces outputs that only assume two states, but the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> swings through a continuous range of motion. These complications can be avoided by using a different nonlinear control design method that produces a continuous controller. In some cases, sliding-mode control designs can be approximated by other continuous control designs.|$|E

(Short Title: snow crab FERO) B. Proposal Summary: Abundance of snow crab in the EBS has dropped to minimum historical levels. At the same time, the geographic range of the female population has contracted substantially towards the NW. In this project we address the following related questions: Why are females where they are now?; how large is their <b>effective</b> reproductive <b>output</b> given where they are?, and how does this affect recruitment? We propose to utilize existing (largely sub-utilized) data and to build upon recent research results, emphasizing a spatially-explicit approach with attention to specific hypotheses on the dynamics of coupled life-history categories (juvenile/immatures, primi/multiparous females, MI/MM males). We address four specific hypotheses: (H 1) snow crab settle and grow to maturity in the Middle Domain; (H 2) after contraction of the stock to the north, cod predation on juveniles controls the southward expansion {{of the range of}} immature females; (H 3) declining recruitment tracks a decline in the stock’s female <b>effective</b> reproductive <b>output</b> (FERO); and (H 4) the spatial configuration of mating opportunities, expressed by the Operationa...|$|R

5000|$|Damping factor : A {{higher number}} is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} better. This {{is a measure of}} how well a power amplifier controls the undesired motion of a loudspeaker driver. An amplifier must be able to suppress resonances caused by mechanical motion (e.g., inertia) of a speaker cone, especially a low frequency driver with greater mass. For conventional loudspeaker drivers, this essentially involves ensuring that the output impedance of the amplifier is close to zero and that the speaker wires are sufficiently short and have sufficiently large diameter. Damping factor is the ratio of the output impedance of an amplifier and connecting cables to the DC resistance of a voice coil, which means that long, high resistance speaker wires will reduce the damping factor. A damping factor of 20 or greater is considered adequate for live sound reinforcement systems, as the SPL of inertia-related driver movement is 26 dB less than signal level and won't be heard. Negative feedback in an amplifier lowers its <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> impedance and thus increases its damping factor.|$|E

Measurements of acoustic emission in manufacturing machines in production lines shows that different events such as, galling, tool wear, lubricating failure, different viscosity of lubricants, stick-slip, necking and cracking of the sheet metal can be separated in time- and frequency domain. Laboratory tests show that proportionality exists between the <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> of the friction surfaces and the measured <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> of the AE-sensor in drawing a sheet metal between flat dies. The measured acoustic emission has been influenced by the smoothness, lubricants, relative speeds between the friction surfaces, the contact pressure between the surfaces, galling, changed geometry's of friction surfaces and different types of material in contact. In a forming process will different lubricants result in different lubricity and the measured <b>effective</b> <b>output</b> of the AE-sensor result in a ranking method.

For the country {{to be able to}} untag itself as a famous drug trafficking hub, the effective and efficient performance of state institutions like the Narcotics Control Board, the Ghana Police Service, the Customs Excise and Preventive Service and the Judiciary is very critical. But how does this become possible in the face of numerous already existing administrative vices? This thesis argues that to a very great extent, corruption and interference by people at the helm of affairs are the main forms of interference {{in the work of the}} drug fighting institutions in Ghana. Corruption basically comes from drug traffickers and dealers themselves in the form of offering bribes to influence the decision of these law and order institutions. On the other hand the activities of politicians or high profile people are seen to be greatly affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of these institutions. Thus while dealers offer bribes for their freedom, the influential persons in society also use their positions to directly deal in drugs or indirectly influence the outcome of cases involving their relatives and friends.
