500|$|Harper {{considered}} {{campaigning for}} the Progressive Conservative Party leadership in 1998, after Jean Charest left federal politics. Among those encouraging his candidacy were senior aides to Ontario Premier Mike Harris, including Tony Clement and Tom Long. He eventually decided against running, {{arguing that it}} would [...] "burn bridges to those Reformers with whom <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> many years" [...] and prevent an alliance of right-wing parties from taking shape. Harper was sceptical about the Reform Party's United Alternative initiative in 1999, arguing that it would serve to consolidate Manning's hold on the party leadership. He also {{expressed concern that the}} UA would dilute Reform's ideological focus.|$|E

500|$|Producer Irwin Winkler {{stated the}} choice to film in Taiwan was due to lower costs. [...] " [...] was very, very expensive, and it was budgeted, because it takes place in 1670 in Japan. We got lucky and found out about Taipei, and in and around Taipei and Taiwan, we found great, great locations. The prices were very cheap, {{and we were able}} to make it for a price." [...] Winkler {{disclosed}} that the tight budget forced many of the cast and crew, including himself, to work for minimum pay: [...] "And all the actors, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, everybody worked for scale. Marty worked for scale, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> under scale. We gave back money." [...] James Martin, a Jesuit priest and published Catholic scholar, worked closely with the filmmakers to ensure an accurate portrayal of the Jesuits.|$|E
500|$|In June 1970, {{during the}} general {{election}} campaign, Levin fell out with the proprietors of The Daily Mail, Lord Rothermere and his son Vere Harmsworth. Levin's contract guaranteed him absolute freedom to write whatever he chose, but Harmsworth, an unswerving Conservative, attempted to censor Levin's support for the other major party, Labour. Levin resigned, and immediately received offers from The Guardian and The Times to join them as a columnist. He found both tempting, {{and at one point}} [...] "even had a wild notion of suggesting that I should write for both simultaneously". In the end, he chose The Times, giving as his reason that though the liberal Guardian was more in line with his own politics than the conservative Times, [...] "I wrote more comfortably against the grain of the paper <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> rather than with it". His obituarist in The Times adds that the decision may also have been swayed by the better remuneration offered by the paper.|$|E
500|$|NBC {{executives}} {{tried to}} solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs. Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I know how hard <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> this. It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Carter recounts how affiliates of NBC complained to the network about the poor ratings performance of Leno's program The Jay Leno Show. O'Brien asked the two NBC executives, [...] "What does Jay have on you? What does this guy have on you people? What the hell is it about Jay?" ...|$|E

500|$|Wings for My Flight {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> so long with those people, it was impossible to be honest about them if I named them".|$|E

Only a year had passed since then. But in the meantime I had come to realise that I admired JatinDa because he personified, perhaps without himself knowing it, the best of mankind. The corollary to that realisation was that Jatinda's death would be avenged if <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> the ideal of establishing a social order in which the best in man could be manifest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, his {{eyesight}} began failing as {{a result}} of the large volume of required reading and the poor visibility under gaslights. The school doctors suggested he give up school entirely. He found another alternative: paying fellow law students to read the textbooks aloud, while he tried to memorize the legal principles. Despite the difficulties, his academic work and memorization talents were so impressive that he graduated as valedictorian and achieved the highest grade point average in the history of the school, a record that stood for eight decades. Brandeis said of that period: [...] "Those years were among the happiest of my life. <b>I</b> <b>worked!</b> <b>For</b> me, the world's center was Cambridge." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Gould's term as NLRB chair {{ended on}} August 27, 1998. Two days later, the Clinton White House asked Truesdale {{to return to}} the NLRB as chair. [...] "I was very {{conflicted}} about it," [...] Truesdale later said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> the NLRB for almost 50 years. How can you say no?" [...] The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould.|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for me at the time.

2500|$|During a hustings for the GMB Union on 7 June, McDonnell {{was asked}} what single act he would do to improve the world if he could travel back to the 1980s. His off-the-cuff reply was that [...] "I was on the GLC that Mrs. Thatcher abolished, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> the NUM {{and we had the}} NUM strike, I think I would assassinate Thatcher". Conservative MP Conor Burns told the BBC that [...] " [...] very distasteful" [...] and [...] "a very silly remark". McDonnell told the BBC: [...] "I'm sorry if I have caused offence to anyone.

2500|$|News {{regarding}} Leno leaked via {{an obscure}} website, FTV Live, {{by the following}} morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien {{as soon as they}} arrived, and although O'Brien had a hint of what was to come, explained the proposed changes. [...] "I know how hard <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> this", responded O'Brien. [...] "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story, and, according to Bill Carter in The War for Late Night, essentially reversed the rumor with a headline reading, [...] "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top." [...] O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action", wrote Carter), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.|$|E

I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E
