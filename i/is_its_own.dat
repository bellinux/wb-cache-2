5|$|The {{album was}} {{completed}} on November 2013, and a bonus disc was also {{made for the}} album, containing the leftover material from the main album as well as songs from Ghost 2, the unreleased compilation of leftover tracks from Ghost. Originally in 2012, Townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the Devin Townsend Project series, but he ultimately confirmed that Casualties of Cool <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> project. Townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through PledgeMusic to support {{the release of the}} album. The funding quickly reached its goal, and all additional funds were put directly to Townsend's upcoming projects. Casualties of Cool was released on May 14, 2014. The album was re-issued worldwide on January 15, 2016 containing an additional DVD with live footage from the 2014 concert at the Union Chapel in London.|$|E

25|$|RAID-Z is a data/parity {{distribution}} scheme like RAID-5, but uses dynamic stripe width: every block <b>is</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> RAID stripe, {{regardless of}} blocksize, resulting in every RAID-Z write being a full-stripe write.
