5|$|A large, {{conspicuous}} mushroom, Amanita muscaria {{is generally}} common and numerous where <b>it</b> <b>grows,</b> {{and is often}} found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.|$|E
5|$|Other {{collections}} sites include Australia, Chile, China, Cuba, Iceland, Korea, and Taiwan. In Hawaii, <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> on {{trunks of}} fallen Cibotium and Aleurites trees. A.sarcoides occurs most frequently {{in late summer}} and autumn.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>grew</b> dark; {{she could}} hear the whisper of the waves upon Bryngelly beach. <b>It</b> <b>grew</b> dark; the night was closing round. She paddled to within a few fathoms of the shore, and called in her clear voice.|$|R
60|$|At length I {{thought that}} I heard a noise, {{a kind of}} murmur far away. <b>It</b> <b>grew,</b> <b>it</b> developed.|$|R
60|$|For {{thoughts}} are {{the food of}} a man's mind; and as the mind feeds, so will <b>it</b> <b>grow.</b> If <b>it</b> feeds on coarse and foul food, coarse and foul <b>it</b> will <b>grow.</b> If <b>it</b> feeds on pure and refined food, pure and refined <b>it</b> will <b>grow.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tube flexes as <b>it</b> <b>grows,</b> {{forming the}} {{crescent-shaped}} cerebral hemispheres at the head. The cerebral hemispheres first appear on day 32.|$|E
5|$|While Amaryllidaceae is not {{native to}} North America, <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> well in USDA {{hardiness}} zones 3B through 10, which encompass {{most of the}} United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a brown rot {{on the wood}} upon which <b>it</b> <b>grows.</b> A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E
6000|$|As I mused I heard a murmur; <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> deep as <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> longer, [...] Speakers using earnest language--"Lady Geraldine, you would!" [...] And I heard a {{voice that}} pleaded, ever on in accents stronger, [...] As a sense of reason gave it power to make its rhetoric good.|$|R
50|$|French priest Luis López Lescure {{helped the}} town <b>grow.</b> <b>It</b> {{is the most}} {{important}} town in eastern Guayas, as <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> around a road junction.|$|R
60|$|I think you're pretty safe now, Lady Kelsey. <b>It's</b> <b>growing</b> late.|$|R
5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula {{was called}} wallum by the Kabi {{people of the}} Sunshine Coast, giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia {{but also to the}} name of the {{ecological}} community <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> in. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. <b>It</b> <b>grows</b> in shallow sand over laterite, in deep sand, and {{occasionally}} atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>grew</b> dark, {{the wind}} whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.|$|R
50|$|Solanum vescum was {{eaten by}} the Gunai people of Gippsland. <b>It</b> <b>grew</b> from seed prolifically after bushfire, {{and the local}} {{indigenous}} people would practice controlled burns to induce <b>it</b> to <b>grow</b> and bear fruit.|$|R
50|$|Barajevo {{is outside}} major roads, {{but it is}} located on the Belgrade-Bar railway. The {{settlement}} itself was further away, but as <b>it</b> <b>grew,</b> <b>it</b> reached the railway.|$|R
5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. <b>It</b> <b>grows</b> on both dry stone and that moistened by seepage, and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which <b>it</b> <b>grows,</b> as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian {{to convince the}} drivers to continue into Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> hot. Men run to meet them: they are told {{they are the first}} Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). They are given ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. <b>It</b> <b>grows</b> vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>grew</b> in the bush, {{but it is}} {{cast away}} in the road.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>grew</b> {{up along}} an old Roman road leading from Strasbourg to Saverne.|$|R
50|$|The company {{announced}} <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> ride numbers and revenue by fivefold in 2014.|$|R
5|$|Gyroporus cyanescens, {{commonly}} known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Gyroporaceae. First described from France in 1788, the species is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and eastern North America, where <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> on the ground in coniferous and mixed forests.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is a {{saprobic}} species, deriving {{nutrients from}} decaying organic matter, particularly the rotting branches and stumps of deciduous trees. One field guide notes {{a preference for}} sugar maple. <b>It</b> <b>grows</b> singly or in bunches, clustered together {{at the base of}} the stem. In Ohio, it typically fruits from late September to mid November.|$|E
5|$|Pluteus nevadensis {{is known}} only from {{subtropical}} and pine {{forests in the}} states of Guerrero and Jalisco, Mexico, where <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> on the rotting wood of pine and oak. It is one of 34 Pluteus species known in Mexico.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> dark, {{and still}} no sign of fair-haired little Flossie.|$|R
50|$|Red Line {{was founded}} in 1979 by Tim Kerrigan and Peter Filice in Novato, California. As <b>it</b> <b>grew,</b> <b>it</b> moved to Martinez, California, and then to Benicia, California.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>grew</b> {{again on}} 10 April 2016 when Sobrio was {{absorbed into the}} municipality.|$|R
5|$|Roridomyces austrororidus, {{commonly}} known as the austro dripping bonnet, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Mycenaceae. Described as new to science in 1962 by American mycologist Rolf Singer, it is found in South America, New Zealand, and Australia, where <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> on rotting wood.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, where <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> singly or in small groups in clayey soils in {{subtropical}} coffee plantations, and from Colombia and Brazil in South America. The mushroom contains the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and psilocin, and all parts will stain blue or bluish black when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii is used for divinatory purposes by some indigenous groups in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where <b>it</b> <b>grows</b> on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a brown rot in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
60|$|A silence fell {{then over}} that larger, denser multitude. <b>It</b> <b>grew</b> impressive, charged, waiting.|$|R
60|$|At last, as <b>it</b> <b>grew</b> towards dinner-time, 'Do {{you know}} Paris?' asked Van Tromp.|$|R
