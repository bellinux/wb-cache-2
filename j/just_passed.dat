5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

25|$|The basic {{structure}} of present-day fire temples {{is always the}} same. There are no indigenous sources older than the 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed {{that they had a}} standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and {{it is possible that the}} temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. (Stausberg, 2004:175,405) On entry one comes into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place.

25|$|In 1910, the Nechacco {{had been}} re-registered as the Chilco and was piloted {{for the first}} part of the season by Captain Bonser and the latter part by Captain George Ritchie. Late in November, she was on her way back from Soda Creek with South Fort George's winter food {{supplies}} and had <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> the Cottonwood Canyon when she hit a reef and sank. The river was nearing freeze up and nothing could be done at that time to salvage her, so the cargo was removed and taken down to Quesnel. Upon hearing of the wreck, one of the Chilco's owners, Russell Peden, and South Fort George hotelier, Al Johnson, immediately snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne, who was then master of the BX, to make one last trip upriver with the much needed supplies. Browne consented and the supplies were delivered without incident, although ice had already begun to form along the shoreline.|$|E
25|$|On October 25, 2016, four people—two men aged 35 and 38, and {{two women}} aged 32 and 42—were killed when the raft they were riding hit another stopped raft, causing it to flip. Eyewitness {{accounts}} noted that the water level in the channel had dropped prior to the incident, but the drop did not trigger a sensor that would have stopped the ride. Investigators believe that the occupied raft was pushed up onto a stopped raft by a conveyor belt, at first mounting the stopped raft then flipping over. Of the six passengers aboard the raft, two children—aged 10 and 12—were ejected from the raft but survived, while {{the two men were}} believed to be crushed under the raft and the two women were trapped underneath the conveyor belt. Dreamworld officials stated that the ride had <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> its annual inspection in September. On November 9 Ardent Leisure chief executive Deborah Thomas announced that the ride would be permanently closed and demolished.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache and had <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> the Grand Canyon {{when he spotted}} a white flag on the river bank. This {{was a sign that}} someone needed the sternwheeler to stop, either to take on cargo or passengers. The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in their pockets, all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E

25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland). Towards {{the end of his}} speech, Smith declared: The calamity through which we have <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> has left traces of sorrow everywhere; hearts have been broken and deep anguish unexpressed; art will typify with master hand its lavish contribution to the sea; soldiers of state and masters of trade will receive the homage which is their honest due; hills will be cleft in search of marble white enough to symbolize these heroic deeds, and, where kinship is the only tie that binds the lowly to the humble home bereft of son or mother or father, little groups of kinsfolk will recount, around the kitchen fire, the traits of human sympathy in those who went down with the ship. These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for better things.|$|E
25|$|Junipero Serra Boulevard {{begins at}} exit 44 (Avalon Drive) of I-280, and travels {{north along the}} east side of I-280 as a four-lane divided highway with minimal intersections, just east of the ridge line of the San Francisco Peninsula that Skyline Boulevard (SR 35) travels along. The median ends when it crosses Hickey Boulevard; the portion of Hickey Boulevard east from Junipero Serra Boulevard to El Camino Real (SR 82) was built as part of that portion of Junipero Serra Boulevard to the north. The {{boulevard}} continues northwards with occasional intersections, some with access to I-280, before crossing to the west side of I-280 just north of Washington Street in Daly City and back to the east side north of School Street. At John Daly Boulevard, Junipero Serra Boulevard crosses I-280 for the final time and becomes part of SR 1; the northbound lanes simply cross over I-280, merging with the ramp that carries SR 1 from I-280 onto the boulevard, but southbound traffic must pass under Daly Boulevard, exit and loop over the bridge it <b>just</b> <b>passed</b> under, and then turn right onto Junipero Serra Boulevard.|$|E
