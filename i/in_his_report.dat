5|$|During {{the court}} of inquiry Justice Simpson became aware of four {{irregularities}} and listed them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even though Steuart {{had fought}} bravely under {{extremely}} difficult conditions, {{neither he nor}} any other officer was cited by Johnson <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report.</b> Gettysburg marked the high-water mark of the Confederacy; thereafter Lee's army would retreat until its final surrender to General Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report,</b> Lord Fraser set out {{a number}} of {{recommendations}} stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish-based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices needs to be made.|$|E

50|$|However, some diaspora-based extreme right-wing {{elites and}} {{opposition}} sites {{entered into a}} protracted tit-for-tat with Dawit as {{he has always been}} balanced <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hoover {{proposed}} a changed economic occupation policy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports,</b> {{if nothing else}} but {{for the sake of}} sparing the American taxpayers the burden of supporting Central Europe indefinitely.|$|R
5|$|There is {{no other}} mention of the tablets <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report,</b> and the {{discovery}} went unnoticed. Eyraud left Easter Island on October 11, in extremely poor health. Ordained a priest in 1865, he returned to Easter Island in 1866 where he died of tuberculosis in August 1868, aged48.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements in 1869, the Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} several unknown chemical elements, including one that would fill {{a gap in the}} carbon family in his Periodic Table of the Elements, located between silicon and tin. Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
50|$|From 2000 to 2005 {{he visited}} public {{organizations}} in various countries (see the list below) and showed {{violations of human}} rights <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports</b> to the corresponding governments for their future improvement.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports,</b> the Secretary-General {{was asked}} to pay {{particular}} attention to the building of the Liberian security sector and to make recommendations on adjustments needed to UNMIL’s operations and training in that regard.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle was}} later {{reported}} back to Europe by Marco Polo, who described the battle vividly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports.</b> <b>His</b> description was presumably pieced together by accounts he heard while visiting {{the court of}} Kublai Khan.|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{satellite}} site of Akte was the ruin that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño referred to as Tanxulukmul in early 1695. Teoberto Maler visited Motul de San José in May 1895, and described one of the stelae <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> Explorations in the Department of Peten, Guatemala, published by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University in 1910. Ian Graham and Arlen Chase have separately mapped portions of the site core.|$|E
5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal. He argued that there were Slovene populations in Styria who would have preferred the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E
5|$|Steve Kleynhans from Gartner urged {{enterprises}} {{to avoid}} migrating to Windows 8.1. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report,</b> {{he indicated that}} as Windows 7 support will be provided until 2020, enterprises should directly migrate to Windows 10 after it is released. Furthermore, he recommended to downgrade devices installed with Windows 8.1 to Windows 7 until Windows 10 is available.|$|E
50|$|P. Devakumaran, a {{journalist}} for News First, was hacked {{to death in}} Navanthurai near Jaffna on 28 May 2008. Devakumaran {{is believed to have}} been murdered by the LTTE after criticising the LTTE <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thompson's accomplishments {{are often}} {{overlooked}} in history books and websites. Dellenbaugh notes that although Thompson was {{largely responsible for}} the [...] "scientific and practical success of the second expedition", Powell ignored Thompson's contributions <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports.</b>|$|R
50|$|Magna Hungaria was {{mentioned}} by the thirteenth-century Franciscan Giovanni da Plano Carpini <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports</b> of <b>his</b> travels <b>in</b> northern and central Asia. Friar Julian also visited Magna Hungaria {{in the interest}} of finding the Eastern Hungarians.|$|R
5|$|Strategically, {{the group}} {{experienced}} internal divisions between a faction that argued for more offensive {{and another that}} wanted to thread lightly {{in order to avoid}} justifying the classification of terrorism. While the pacifist faction carried damage control and held two toy give always for Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, Ojeda was removed from the political branch on June 4, 1985, due to these conflicts, being only left in charge of his unit. Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also unsatisfied when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>Report</b> on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E
5|$|Alms {{sent the}} {{captured}} Alliantie back to Britain {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of Stag and gave despatches to the Admiralty to Lieutenant William Huggell of Reunion to deliver. He himself remained at sea with the squadron, completing their assigned patrol. British casualties included four killed and 13 wounded on Stag, one killed and three wounded on Reunion and two wounded on Isis. Only Vestal escaped without any damage or casualties. Batavian casualties in the engagement are not known due to the failure of Alms to record Allianties losses <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> to the Admiralty, an omission which James criticises him for. It is known that Argo lost two men killed and 15 wounded in the chase. The surviving Batavian ships remained at anchor in the Eigerøya channel until the spring of 1796 when they successfully returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On 25 November 2011 the Australian Communications and Media Authority {{found that}} Jones had {{breached}} the commercial radio {{code of practice}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting</b> of environmental issues. <b>His</b> <b>reporting</b> was found to lack accuracy and failed to allow other viewpoints to be heard. A decision on the penalty for this breach was reserved.|$|R
50|$|Covering the 2013 NUS National Conference in Sheffield for The Epinal, Pearson {{was quoted}} by The Independent <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting</b> of the cheers that rung out amongst {{sections}} of the conference floor upon the news of Baroness Thatcher's death.|$|R
50|$|He {{explored}} and mapped Hokkaido and Sakhalin {{and some}} of the Kuril Islands <b>in</b> 1785-1786. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports</b> to the Tokugawa shogunate, he emphasized the need to defend the islands. He compiled a preliminary Ainu-Japanese dictionary in ``Ezo Soshi".|$|R
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1794, war {{continued}} in the Rhineland, with General Louis Desaix pushing back the Coalition forces. Nansouty's 9th Cavalry was brigaded together with the 17th Dragoon Regiment, with General Delmas de La Coste as commander. The brigade performed well against Austrian cavalry in two distinct actions {{at the end of}} May of that year. General of Division Michaud, the commander-in-chief of France's Army of the Rhine, noted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> that Delmas's two regiments showed bravery and intrepidity every time they faced the enemy. In July, the 9th Cavalry was involved in several well-led cavalry actions and Nansouty acquired an excellent reputation, recognised as a disciplinarian and a commander who knew how to drill his men effectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report.</b> He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> to the War Office on the battle, Murray passed lightly {{over the}} part {{played by the}} Anzac Mounted Division. The {{majority}} of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray's staff. Lawrence was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused. In view of this, Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award at all, and he was merely mentioned in despatches.|$|E
50|$|Pincus {{has been}} criticised by other journalists, {{including}} {{colleagues at the}} Washington Post, for factual inaccuracies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting</b> and <b>in</b> particular for failing to adequately address inaccuracies, even in cases where he has seemingly acknowledged the errors himself.|$|R
5000|$|The Czechoslovak consul in Skopje in 1928, Vladimír Znojemský, {{underlined}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reports</b> {{the existence}} of a Macedonian nation in Macedonia, which is [...] "different from what the others are, whose people speak a different language and feel different".|$|R
2500|$|Progressive media {{monitoring}} {{organizations such as}} Media Matters and Fairness and Accuracy <b>in</b> <b>Reporting</b> have criticized <b>his</b> <b>reporting</b> {{on a variety of}} issues, accusing him of distorting facts and using misleading or erroneous statistics. [...] In 2008, citing numerous inaccuracies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting,</b> MediaMatters for America awarded him its first annual [...] "Misinformer of the Year" [...] award.|$|R
5|$|On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen {{to destroy}} a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal {{officers}} and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> that he believed Scott and his officers had done all {{they could do to}} prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>report</b> to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken {{on the day of}} the murders and later. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>report,</b> dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E
50|$|Woodward often uses unnamed sources <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting</b> for the Post and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> books. Using {{extensive}} {{interviews with}} firsthand witnesses, documents, meeting notes, diaries, calendars, and other documentation, Woodward attempts {{to construct a}} seamless narrative of events, most often told {{through the eyes of}} the key participants.|$|R
5000|$|Weinstein {{was known}} for using alliteration <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>reporting.</b> He coined the phrases [...] "Topping tonight's Eyewitness News" [...] and [...] "It's eleven o'clock.
