40|$|We {{compared}} Ro 11 - 8958, {{an analog}} of trimethoprim (TMP) with improved antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, other dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and dapsone (DAP) {{in the treatment}} of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in an immunosuppressed rat model. In contrast to previous reports, high dosages of the DHFR inhibitors were used in combination with fixed, low dosages of SMX (3 mg/kg of body weight per day) or DAP (25 mg/kg/day). When administered alone at these dosages, SMX and DAP reduced the median P. carinii cyst count about 5 - to 15 -fold. Ro 11 - 8958, TMP, and <b>diaveridine</b> used at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with SMX were only slightly more effective than SMX used alone. However, administration of these DHFR inhibitors at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with SMX lowered the cyst count about 500 - to 1, 000 -fold, indicating a synergistic effect. Little or no synergism was found when other DHFR inhibitors (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, and tetroxoprim) were combined with SMX. Regimens of Ro 11 - 8958 at a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day with DAP and of TMP or <b>diaveridine</b> used at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP showed comparable anti-P. carinii activity, lowering the cyst count 100 - to 200 -fold. By contrast, Ro 11 - 8958 administered at a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day with DAP reduced the cyst count > 1, 000 -fold. Thus, the experimental approach used here enables the rat model of pneumocystosis to be used to compare synergistic combinations of antifolate drugs. The favorable results achieved with Ro 11 - 8958 indicate that it should be considered for clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of {{folic acid}} {{synthesis}} were compared alone {{and in different}} combinations in the therapy of pneumocystosis in immunosuppressed rats. Sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfadoxine) and sulfones (dapsone) used alone were very active against Pneumocystis carinii, as judged by histologic examination of the lungs and by organism quantitation. Improved efficacy could not be demonstrated {{by the addition of}} an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase to the regimen. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (trimethoprim, <b>diaveridine,</b> and pyrimethamine) used alone were ineffective against P. carinii. All drugs were well tolerated except pyrimethamine, which caused bone marrow depression; folinic acid ameliorated this adverse reaction but did not interfere with P. carinii treatment. These data have potential clinical implications but need to be interpreted with caution and in light of other systems of P. carinii drug evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was directed to propose sensitive, accurate and reproducible methods of analysis that can be applied to determine distigmine bromide (DTB), cyclopentolate hydrochloride (CPHC), <b>diaveridine</b> hydrochloride (DVHC) and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride (THHC) drugs in pure form and pharmaceutical preparations via charge-transfer complex formation with 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) reagents. Spectrophotometric method involve the addition a known excess of TCNQ or TCNE reagents to DTB, CPHC, DVHC and THHC drugs in acetonitrile, followed by the measurement of the absorbance of the CT complexes at the selected wavelength. The reaction stoichiometry is found to be 1 : 1 [drug]: [TCNQ or TCNE]. The absorbance is found to increase linearly with concentration of the drugs under investigation which is corroborated by the correlation coefficients of 0. 9954 - 0. 9981. The system obeys Beerâ€™s law for 6 - 400, 20 - 500...|$|E
