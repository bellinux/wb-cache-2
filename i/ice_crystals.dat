5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} habit of an <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> grown in air at 4. 0 x 10 Pa under a supersaturation below 5 % and its growth mechanism were investigated by repeating the growth and evaporation of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal.</b> As a result, the habit change of an <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> with temperature under this growth condition roughly coincides with that of an <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> growing in air at 1. 0 x 105 Pa, and {{it was found that}} the { 0001 } and { 10 [MATH] 0 } faces of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> grown at a supersaturation below 5 % grew by a screw dislocation mechanism.

5|$|The <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> in cirrus clouds have {{different}} shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals,</b> they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

50|$|According to this hypothesis, AFPs {{disrupt the}} {{thermodynamically}} favourable growth of an <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> via kinetic inhibition of contact between solid ice and liquid water. In this manner, the nucleation {{sites of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> lattice are blocked by the AFP, inhibiting {{the rapid growth of}} the crystal that could be fatal for the organism. In physical chemistry terms, the AFPs adsorbed onto the exposed <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> force the growth of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> in a convex fashion as the temperature drops, which elevates the ice vapour pressure at the nucleation sites.

5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> that {{precipitate}} {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon.

5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed.

5|$|Other {{observations}} in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen {{also discovered that}} tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water {{and a great deal}} of <b>ice</b> <b>crystals.</b> The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing.

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the <b>ice</b> <b>crystals</b> in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of high, persistent ice supersaturation {{inside and outside}} cold cirrus in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) remains an enigma that is intensely debated as the "ice supersaturation puzzle". However, it was recently confirmed that observed supersaturations are consistent with very low <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> concentrations, which is incompatible {{with the idea that}} homogeneous freezing is the major method of ice formation in the TTL. Thus, the tropical tropopause "ice supersaturation puzzle" has become an "ice nucleation puzzle". To explain the low <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> concentrations, a number of mainly heterogeneous freezing methods have been proposed. Here, we reproduce in situ measurements of frequencies of {{occurrence of}} <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> concentrations by extensive model simulations, driven by the special dynamic conditions in the TTL, namely the superposition of slow large-scale updraughts with high-frequency short waves. From the simulations, it follows that the full range of observed <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> concentrations can be explained when the model results are composed from scenarios with consecutive heterogeneous and homogeneous ice formation and scenarios with pure homogeneous ice formation occurring in very slow (− 1) and faster (> 1 cm s − 1) large-scale updraughts, respectively. This statistical analysis shows that about 80 % of TTL cirrus can be explained by "classical" homogeneous ice nucleation, while the remaining 20 % stem from heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing occurring within the same environment. The mechanism limiting <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> production via homogeneous freezing in an environment full of gravity waves is the shortness of the gravity waves, which stalls freezing events before a higher <b>ice</b> <b>crystal</b> concentration can be formed...|$|R

5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow.

Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for <b>ice</b> <b>crystals,</b> from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice.
