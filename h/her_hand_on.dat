This photograph was quickly reproduced {{on the front pages}} of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|Freyr arrives {{home and}} neither sleeps nor drinks, {{remaining}} in silence. No one dares speak to him. The god Njörðr sends Freyr's servant Skírnir {{to speak to}} Freyr. Freyr tells Skírnir that he saw a beautiful woman, so beautiful that he was filled with grief {{and that he would}} soon die if he could not have her. Freyr tells Skírnir that he must go gain <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his behalf—whether the woman's father agrees or not—and he will be rewarded. Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr gives him the sword and Skírnir sets off. Skírnir asks for the woman's hand for Freyr and receives her promise. Nine nights later she is to meet with Freyr at a location called Barey. Skírnir delivers the news to Freyr and Freyr responds with the final stanza from the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál, lamenting that he must wait.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E

He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E

25|$|The time is 9.20pm. Sir Roger is {{enclosed}} {{in his study}} {{at the back of}} the hall. Dr. Sheppard was with him but Parker told Mrs. Ackroyd that he left earlier and, as far as she knows, Sir Roger is now alone. Flora follows her mother to bed and Raymond and Parker hear Sir Roger's voice coming from the other side of the door as he somewhat stiltedly tells an unknown person that he can give them no money as they require. Blunt enters from the terrace and he and Raymond go to the billiard room. Parker switches off the hall lights and leaves momentarily but re-enters a moment later to see Flora with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the study door. She tells the butler that she has said goodnight to her uncle and that he doesn’t want to be disturbed. The two leave.|$|E
25|$|At Taormina {{they check}} into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's {{employer}} Ettore {{and his wife}} Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party Sandro checks out the women—recognizing the beautiful aspiring actress Gloria Perkins. Back in the room Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro having sex with Gloria Perkins on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{his head in a}} gesture of compassion and comfort while looking out at the snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E
500|$|Janet sings Yazoo's [...] "Only You" [...] to Duane, who {{stops the}} music after Fran whispers to him. Chastising Connie, Duane {{says that he}} does not like Janet [...] "in that way". Roger steps in; someone has to be made redundant, but it will be him, and he has {{recommended}} that Fran be promoted. A hen do arrives in the booth, and a newcomer, Chantel, begins [...] "Titanium" [...] (David Guetta and Sia). Watched by Janet, Connie confronts and kisses Greg; Roger meets eyes with a young woman. Connie mocks Janet, who reminds the former that she can lip read. Janet whispers to Fran, who confronts Greg and Connie; UV light reveals Connie's lipstick on Greg's mouth, and Fran tells them that they are both fired. Fran sings with Chantel, Roger dances with the young woman, and Greg and Connie argue. Duane and Janet meet eyes, and Duane places <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his chest; she feels his heartbeat as the two kiss.|$|E

When the song finishes, Greg sombrely talks to Fran.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} one of {{the first}} scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot. To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in the soccer field shed, Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a Technodolly, a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements. Two versions of the scene were then re-filmed without Alexandre, with Maslany playing each of the characters. To simulate Alison placing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Sarah's shoulder, a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison, and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison's arm away, Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted {{as if she had been}} hit when playing Alison. The final scene was created through digital compositing, whereby both versions of the scene—with Maslany playing both characters separately—are combined to produce a single shot. Maslany felt that, as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself, she over-thought the process: [...] "I think I was trying too hard to get it right. Nobody's there when you're shooting these things, so you overcompensate." ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{first met}} Janet Reno in November 1975, when {{he applied for}} {{a job as an}} {{assistant}} state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder and responded, [...] "I'm only interested in virile men. That’s why I'm not attracted to you." [...] He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was [...] "a political ploy". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a [...] "kook".|$|E

500|$|Mohini {{also has}} an active history in the {{destruction}} of demons throughout Hindu texts. In the Vishnu Purana, Mohini defeats Bhasmasura, the [...] "ash-demon". Bhasmasura invokes the god Shiva by performing severe penances. Shiva, pleased with Bhasmasura, grants him the power to turn anyone into ashes by touching their head. The demon decides to try the power on Shiva himself. Shiva runs terrified. Vishnu, witnessing the unfortunate turn of events, transforms into Mohini and charms Bhasmasura. Bhasmasura is so taken by Mohini that he asks her to marry him. Mohini agrees, but only on the condition that Bhasmasura follows her move for move in a dance. In the course of the dance, she places <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her head. Bhasmasura mimics the action, and in turn, reduces himself to ashes. The legend of Bhasmasura is retold in the Buddhist text Satara Dewala Devi Puvata, with a slight variation. In this tale, Vishnu assumes his female form (the name [...] "Mohini" [...] is not used) and charms Bhasmasura. The female Vishnu asks Bhasmasura to promise never to leave her by placing his hand on his head as per the usual practice to swear on one's head. On doing so, Bhasmasura is reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Marshall, another {{archeologist}} at Mohenjo-daro, {{described the}} figure as [...] "a young girl, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats {{time to the}} music with her legs and feet." [...] The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, [...] "We may not be certain {{that she was a}} dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas {{helped the}} United States win a second {{consecutive}} {{gold medal in}} the team event, which was also her third Olympic gold medal. When the team final scores were announced, Douglas and her teammates called themselves the [...] "Final Five" [...] in honor of coach Marta Karolyi's retirement and the team size being reduced to four beginning in 2020. During the podium ceremony when the national anthem was played, Douglas received criticism on social media for not placing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her heart, which was seen by some as controversial since her role in the 2016 team had diminished compared to the 2012 squad.|$|E

It was commissioned by the Duc d'Orleans, the son of King [...] Louis Philippe I), and had very elaborate architectural background designed {{by one of the}} Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in white, whose contemplative pose with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her chin recurs in some of Ingres's female portraits.|$|E
