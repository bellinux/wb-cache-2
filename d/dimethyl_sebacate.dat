50|$|Hydrogenolysis of ester {{compounds}} to {{the corresponding}} alcohols, and carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds to single bonds. For example, sebacion, {{derived from the}} acyloin condensation of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> is hydrogenated to 1,2-cyclodecanediol by this catalyst. Phenanthrene is also reduced, at the 9,10 position.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of {{high molecular weight}} esters such as bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate is of significance for its use as a lubricant. This ester is synthesized by the transesterification of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> with 2 -ethylhexanol. Therefore, the solubilities of bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> were determined at 308 - 328 K at pressures of 10 - 18 MPa in supercritical carbon dioxide. The solubility of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> was always higher than bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate at a given temperature and pressure. The Mendez-Teja model was used to verify the self-consistency of data. Further, a new semi-empirical model with three parameters was developed using the solution theory coupled with Wilson activity coefficient. This model was used to correlate the experimental data of this work and solubilities of many high molecular weight esters reported in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The enzymatic {{synthesis}} of polyesters by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and polycondensation in three ionic liquids, i. e., [bmim][Tf 2 N], [bmim][PF 6] and [bmim][BF 4] was investigated. For the enzymatic ROP of e-caprolactone {{it was found}} that [bmim][PF 6] and [bmim][BF 4] result in an inhomogeneous reaction mixture upon polymerization, causing polymerization characteristics similar to bulk polymerization. In contrast, for [bmim][Tf 2 N] characteristics similar to toluene were observed. Molecular weights of 7000 â€“ 9500 g/mol were obtained. In the polycondensation of dimethyl adipate and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sebacate,</b> respectively, with 1, 4 -butanol the low volatility of ionic liquids was successfully utilized to perform the reactions in an open vessel at temperatures close to the boiling point of the condensation by-product. Molecular weights up to 5400 g/mol were obtained. This, in combination with the tunable solvent hydrophilicity of ionic liquids could offer an advantage in the polymerization of highly polar monomers with low solubility in organic solvents...|$|E
