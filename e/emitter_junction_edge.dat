50|$|The UJT {{is biased}} with a {{positive}} voltage between the two bases. This causes a potential drop {{along the length of}} the device. When the emitter voltage is driven approximately one diode voltage above the voltage at the point where the P diffusion (emitter) is, current will begin to flow from the emitter into the base region. Because the base region is very lightly doped, the additional current (actually charges in the base region) causes conductivity modulation which reduces the resistance of the portion of the base between the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> and the B2 terminal. This reduction in resistance means that the <b>emitter</b> <b>junction</b> is more forward biased, and so even more current is injected. Overall, the effect is a negative resistance at the emitter terminal. This is what makes the UJT useful, especially in simple oscillator circuits.|$|R
