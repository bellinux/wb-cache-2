40|$|The {{rising trend}} in the {{prevalence}} of obesity {{has become a major}} public health concern in many countries during the past decades, partly because being obese is associated with comorbidities and death. The cost of treatment for obesity related diseases has become a heavy burden on the national health care budget in many countries. The treatment options for obesity are mainly weight management therapies in the form of diet and exercise, pharmacological therapy, and surgery. The incidence of bariatric surgery in Sweden has increased eight-fold in the last decade. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass surgical treatments for obesity in adult patients, in comparison with conventional treatment, in Sweden from a societal perspective. The conventional treatment alternative consisted of the prevalent mixture of non-surgical obesity treatments. A model of individual patients was used to simulate the outcomes of the patients in terms of treatment costs, indirect costs, life years, and quality adjusted life years (QALY) over a lifetime perspective. In patients with a Body Mass Index of 40 - 44 kg/m 2, surgery was estimated to be cost-saving in men and judged cost-effective in women, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of SEK 26 <b>thousand</b> (<b>EUR</b> 3 <b>thousand).</b> The incremental cost associated with gastric bypass decreases with BMI, increases with the patient's age, and is higher in women than in men. Taking patient characteristics and uncertainty in input data and model design into account, the incremental cost is estimated to be at most SEK 160 thousand per QALY gained (about <b>EUR</b> 18 <b>thousand</b> per QALY). In conclusion, gastric bypass surgery appears to be a cost-effective intervention compared to conventional treatment in adult persons with obesity in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} of building UL FGG at Hajdrihova ulica 28 has been analysed. Two examinations with a thermal camera were performed. The thermograms revealed {{failures in the}} structure {{that could not be}} noticed visually before. The walls’ structure was obtained from the project description from year 1955. In order to check the walls’ actual composition, the heat flux was measured with a thermocouple at four characteristic points of the building envelope. Thermal transmittance was calculated from the measured heat flux and compared with the thermal transmittance gained through the estimated thicknesses and physical properties of the walls’ layers. For the longitudinal thermal bridges, longitudinal thermal transmittance was calculated with a computer program THERM. The outer and inner dimensions of the building were acquired with a laser measurement. With the program Gradbena fizika URSA 4. 0, an energy performance certificate was prepared and the results were compared with the results from the energy performance certificate that already existed for the building. Taking into account that the building belongs to cultural heritage, measures for energysaving renovation were proposed, which would reduce heath losses and increase energy efficiency. In addition, measures were proposed for the use of renewable energy resources that would provide the energy required for the functioning of the building. The costs for the proposed measures were estimated. The most efficient and also the most required measure is the thermal insulation of the ceiling toward unheated attic, which was estimated to be 20 <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR.</b> The investment would be repaid in 4 years time...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified social cost-benefit analysis approach tested on around thirty projects of small infrastructure in Croatia, and deals {{with some of}} the specific issues encountered in this field work. In Zadar and Sibenik– Knin counties, Croatia, a Sustainable Development Project funded by CARDS -Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation- was active from 2003 to 2006 for the war-affected areas. The project aimed to support the two administrations in managing local development programs through CARDS and to prepare for the pre-accession Funds. The assistance consisted in training in EU procedures, preparing grant scheme, updating the Regional Operational Program, implementing an infrastructure project pipeline. The paper focuses on the last activity, more precisely on the project appraisal for the preparation of the pipeline, and describes the experience developed in this context through a methodology commonly used for the management and evaluation of infrastructures funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds. The methodology applied for the evaluation was social cost-benefit analysis. The challenge of this experience is represented by the reference context, where either Public Administration than local actors started only recently to cope with the EU program procedures and principles, and by the chosen operative methods, made of a cooperation of International experts and professional evaluators with local personnel. Given the financial dimension of the concerned projects (from a few hundred <b>thousands</b> <b>EUR</b> to a maximum of five millions EUR, with one exception) a simplified yet rigorous version of the standard methodology has been applied. For the data collection the input came from the contribution of local actors, either the personnel of the company appointed for the management of this program than the Public Administration and the projects promoters. Surveys, personal interviews through well-structured questionnaires, printouts' desk analysis and presentation of the main results were the activities of the involved personnel. The application of a standard methodology allows a certain degree of comparability among the projects and makes it easy to horizontally read the interventions' performance. The message of the paper is that even for small infrastructure projects CBA is a tool by means of which project analysts and decision-makers could have a useful dialogue for the planning exercise.

40|$|Commercial airliners have {{continually}} voiced {{the need}} to improve the availability of their fleet and with current financial pressures facing many airlines this need has even become more significant. SHM can contribute to enhancing aircraft availability through substituting routine heavy structural maintenance inspections with automation. However, specific aircraft locations and the impact of SHM alternatives are yet to be defined. The paper presents a two stage approach centred on analysing maintenance intervals, and areas where improvements to an aircraft's availability can be achieved. This approach is explained with reference to real aircraft maintenance scenarios where critical areas are identified and the impact of implementing such technologies are assessed. The analysis requires initially sourcing information via maintenance documentation and then mapping sequences of steps from the data collected. As part of a study to highlight the approach two types of scheduled intervals were taken for analysis. Conventional DCheck (still adopted today) was modelled with a discrete event simulation tool called Arena. Savings of 3 hours per D-check interval could be realised by placing hotspot monitoring to a set of locations highlighted in the paper. This would equate to 6 hours saved over the life, which may be insufficient to justify investment in SHM technologies. It also proves that aircraft maintenance processes and damage tolerant design are well optimised from an initial design point of view and that the high degree of an aircraft disassembly required may only provide a very limited potential for SHM within the frame of current aircraft initial structural design. However aircraft structures are likely to fracture at locations other than those predicted initially. This effect is not critical from a safety point of view since those fractures are detected well before they become critical. However those damages being called the drop outs lead to specially directed inspections which are likely to fall outside of the conventional maintenance schedule and hence can become comparatively costly. The example of a 2400 FC interval only provided here has three items of which the critical item is a detailed inspection that always lies on the critical path, despite fluctuations with uncertainties. Substituting for a SHM centred process could save up to 280 hours over the aircraft life. With the cost of operation at a few <b>thousand</b> <b>EUR</b> per hour, application of SHM to drop out intervals to further optimise maintenance processes could certainly justify future investment...|$|R
