Accumulation of high {{concentrations}} of Na and Cl ions in soils is one factor that hampers plant establishment along roadsides in regions where <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> are used to improve winter driving conditions. However, there is little information on the accumulation of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> in roadside soil {{as well as on}} the phytotoxic impact of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> on pines in Northeast China. The accumulation of salt in soil and injuries on pine needles (Pinus tabulaeformis) were investigated in the urban areas of Shenyang city in 2011. The results showed that the use of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> on roads leads to the high accumulation of sodium (352 – 513 mg·kg- 1) and chloride (577 – 2, 353 mg·kg- 1) in urban roadside soil.

Much higher concentrations of Na+ and Cl− ions were found at 10 meters from the road than at the road edge and it is assumed that this is due to long-term contamination from water accumulating from melting snow.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of transport properties of concrete {{is considered by}} many to have the potential to serve as a performance criterion that can be related to concrete durability. However, the sensitivity of transport tests to several parameters combined with the low permeability of concrete complicates the testing. Gas permeability and diffusivity test methods are attractive due to the ease of testing, their non-destructive nature and their potential to correlate to in-field carbonation of reinforced concrete structures. ^ This work was aimed at investigating the potential of existing gas transport tests as a way to reliably quantify transport properties in concrete. In this study gas permeability and diffusivity test methods were analyzed comparing their performance in terms of repeatability and variability. The influence of several parameters was investigated such as moisture content, mixture proportions and gas flow. A closer look to the influence of pressure revealed an anomalous trend of permeability with respect to pressure. An alternative calculation is proposed in an effort to move towards the determination of intrinsic material properties that can serve as an input for service life prediction models. ^ The impact of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> exposure was also analyzed with respect to their alteration of the degree of saturation as this may affect gas transport in cementitious materials. Limited information were previously available on liquid properties over a wide range of concentrations. To overcome this limitation, this study quantified surface tension, viscosity in presence of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> in a broad concentration range and at different temperatures. Existing models were applied to predict the change of fluid properties during drying. Vapor desorption isotherms were obtained to investigate the influence of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> presence on the non-linear moisture diffusion coefficient. Semi-empirical models were used to quantify the initiation and the rate of drying using liquid properties and pore structure information as inputs. Concrete exposed to <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> resulted to have a reduced gas transport due to the higher degree of saturation (DOS). The higher DOS is believed to contribute to the premature deterioration observed in concrete pavements exposed to <b>deicing</b> <b>salts.</b> ^ Moisture diffusion and moisture profiles in concrete are known to directly relate with the stresses generated during shrinkage and creep mechanisms. The alteration due to the presence of shrinkage reducing admixtures on drying was also investigated in this work. Liquid properties were used to predict the diffusion coefficient in presence of SRA. Moisture profiles obtained using Fick 2 ̆ 7 s second law for diffusion were compared to relative humidity profiles measured on concrete slabs.

40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> and their trace {{minerals}} on bituminous highway wearing courses was prompted by early pavement deterioration of federal and state highways in Indiana. Several bituminous surface courses containing slag, slag-dolomite, or dolomite aggregates showed deterioration soon after <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> were first applied. Initially, a detailed literature review (Appendix A of report) was conducted. Data on eighteen dolomite sources from a previous study (Bruner, Choi and West, 1995) plus ten additional dolomite sources formed the basis for the brine freeze thaw testing program. Mercury intrusion porosimetry testing conducted on multiple specimens showed that rock texture significantly affects pore size distribution. Petrographic analysis, acid etching of thin sections and electron microprobe studies revealed the distribution of clays on dolomite grains. Additional brine freeze thaw testing on selected dolomite sources, plus one slag sample, were conducted using <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> from six Indiana highway districts. Petrographic evaluation of pavement cores from the distressed pavements was accomplished. Brine freeze thaw test results ranged from 0. 6 to 27. 3 % loss for the 28 samples; this test is a good measure of aggregate durability. INDOT has recommended a maximum 30 % loss for the brine freeze thaw test. Regression analysis showed that acid insoluble residue content and sodium sulfate loss have the highest correlation with brine freeze thaw loss; elemental magnesium content has a negative correlation with it. It is concluded that dolomite aggregates with a low insoluble residue content have lower sulfate soundness losses, lower brine freeze-thaw losses and greater durability. Evaluation of pavement cores indicated no evidence of deterioration caused by aggregate weathering or degradation.

In the case of hardened cement paste with NTS admixture changes in the microstructure of the surface layer are less prominent: the number and size of cavities and micro-cracks are smaller. The test revealed that compressive stress, which before freezing – thawing with <b>deicing</b> <b>salt</b> test was very similar in hardened cement paste with and without NTS admixture (85. 4  MPa and 82. 8  MPa respectively), changed after 56 cycles of freezing – thawing with <b>deicing</b> <b>salt</b> test as follows: reduced by 39. 5  % in concrete without NTS admixture and increased slightly (2. 5  %) in hardened cement paste with NTS admixture.

In theory, the concrete has to crack when loaded in tension for the steel to begin to share the load in the steel reinforced concrete composite. The concrete helps protect the steel by providing an alkaline environment (ph=13 in many cases) to retard corrosion of the steel. To properly protect the steel the concrete needs to cover the steel by more than the minimum thickness, not have large cracks and not have its chemistry altered by environmental factors like chloride attack from <b>deicing</b> <b>salts,</b> carbonation, etc.. ACI and PCI (American Concrete Institute, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute) codes specify minimum cover thicknesses depending on the application of the structure. In practice, steel often corrodes due to improper placement of steel reinforcement, moisture drive through cracks, poor workmanship, environmental effects such as <b>deicing</b> <b>salts</b> or coastal environments and a myriad of other causes. Due to the inherent properties of steel reinforced concrete, many structures are expensive, heavy and costly to maintain. The repair of these structures is a multibillion-dollar business worldwide according to industry sources (ICRI International Concrete Repair Institute).|$|R
