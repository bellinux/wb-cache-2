In the present study, the effect of the interaction between two geometrical parameters (swirl-generating vane angle and <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter) on the swirl effervescent atomizer spray angle was studied. A newly-designed swirl effervescent atomizer was developed with 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° swirl-generating vane angle and 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 mm <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter.

In this case, when the mixture enters the injector and flows downstream through the variable cross-section passage toward the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice,</b> partial nucleation of the dissolved gas is expected to occur at different locations along the duct, which transforms the mixture into tiny bubbles that grow fast downstream.

Despite of the advantages and potential of various applications, this type of atomizer was not widely used. This {{is due to the}} lack of extensive studies on the external and internal flow of this atomizer. Therefore, there is a need to understand the behaviour of the external and internal flow of this atomizer. In this study, the atomizer was designed, fabricated and later tested with water as the working fluid and nitrogen gas as the atomizing gas. An experimental test rig was built to evaluate the relation of swirl-generating vane angle, gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) and <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter with spray angle, breakup length and gas core diameter respectively. To ensure optimization of experiment, Box-Behnken design of experiment was applied. High-speed shadowgraph was utilized during the recordings of resultant spray patterns and internal flow structure.

40|$|The flow {{focusing}} principle {{has recently}} been shown to successfully generate micrometer viscoelastic jets. In this technique, the liquid jet is gently extruded by the smooth suction caused by the acceleration in the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> of a coflowing gas stream. Nozzle clogging is a rare phenomenon in flow focusing because the emitted jet is much thinner than all the passages and orifices in the device.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} the Rotor Force Test Facility at the California Institute of Technology have {{examined the effects of}} a tip leakage restriction and swirl brakes on the rotordynamic forces due to leakage flows on an impeller undergoing a prescribed circular whirl. The experiments simulate the leakage flow conditions and geometry of the Alternate Turbopump Design (ATD) of the Space Shuttle High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump and are critical to evaluating the pump's rotordynamic instability problems. Previous experimental and analytical results have shown that discharge-to-suction leakage flows in the annulus of a shrouded centrifugal pump contribute substantially to the fluid induced rotordynamic forces. Also, previous experiments have shown that leakage inlet (pump discharge) swirl can increase the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient and hence increase the range of positive whirl for which the tangential force is destabilizing. In recent experimental work, the present authors demonstrated that when the swirl velocity within the leakage path is reduced by the introduction of ribs or swirl brakes, then a substantial decrease in both the destabilizing normal and tangential forces could be achieved. Motivation for the present research is that previous experiments have shown that restrictions such as wear rings or orifices at pump inlets affect the leakage forces. Recent pump designs such as the Space Shuttle Alternate Turbopump Design (ATD) utilize tip <b>orifices</b> at <b>discharge</b> for the purpose of establishing axial thrust balance. The ATD has experienced rotordynamic instability problems and one may surmise that these tip <b>discharge</b> <b>orifices</b> may also have an important effect on the normal and tangential forces in the plane of impeller rotation. The present study determines if such tip leakage restrictions contribute to undesirable rotordynamic forces. Additional motivation for the present study is that the widening of the leakage path annular clearance and the installation of swirl brakes in the ATD has been proposed to solve its instability problems. The present study assesses the effect of such a design modification on the rotordynamic forces. The experimental apparatus consists of a solid or dummy impeller, a housing instrumented for pressure measurements, a rotating dynamometer and an eccentric whirl mechanism. The solid impeller is used so that leakage flow contributions to the forces are measured, but the main throughflow contributions are not experienced. The inner surface of the housing has been modified to accommodate meridional ribs or swirl brakes within the leakage annulus. In addition, the housing has been modified to accommodate a <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> that qualitatively simulates one side of the balance piston orifice of the Space Shuttle ATD. Results indicate the detrimental effects of a <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> and the beneficial effects of brakes. Plots of the tangential and normal forces versus whirl ratio show a substantial increase in these forces along with destabilizing resonances at some positive whirl ratios when a <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> is added.

For the tangential force, a plot versus whirl ratio shows a significant reduction and a destabilizing resonance appears to be eliminated.

The design concept is the same as a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), but is a breath actuated device (Oxette®). This work predicts the residual mass median diameter (MMD) of the spray issuing from early stage Oxette® prototypes by using an evaporation model of multi-component liquid droplets {{with the help of a}} numerical multi-component two-phase actuation model (developed by the authors) to quantify the sprays. Two different formulations with 95 % and 98 % mass fraction of HFA 134 a, and two prototypes of cigarette alternatives with different expansion chamber volumes have been analyzed by the numerical model and compared with laser based measurements. The later designed device provides a larger expansion chamber volume to enhance the propellant evaporation, recirculation, bubble generation and growth inside the chamber, and it makes a significant improvement to produce finer sprays than the earlier design.

Thanks to its multi-scale and global nature, it allows identifying all dynamics simultaneously {{involved in the process}} with no restriction of the liquid system shape. In the present work this multi-scale tool is applied on 2 D visualizations of free falling jets of a low-viscosity viscoelastic solution. The jets are produced from a cylindrical <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> and the liquid is a very dilute polymer solution containing 5 ppm of Poly(ethylene oxide). High spatial resolution images of the free falling jets are performed {{as a function of the}} velocity and at several distances from the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice.</b> For every operating condition, the liquid jet remains cylindrical first, then shows the development of a sinusoidal perturbation and finally adopts a beads-on-a-string pattern before breakup occurs. The multi-scale analysis is performed on a high number of images and at several spatial positions in order to return statistical and temporal information, respectively. The results of this analysis show that during the sinusoidal perturbation stage, the large-scale region follows an exponential increase as predicted by the linear stability theory and during the beads-on-a-string stage, the small-scale region follows an exponential decrease similar to an elasto-capillary regime from which the relaxation time of the polymer solution can be extracted. This work positions the multi-scale approach as a promising and complementary tool to the currently used techniques in order to probe complex liquid rheology, especially in the case of mobile viscoelastic solutions.

40|$|Atomization is {{a process}} where the bulk of liquid jet disintegrates into liquid sheets, ligaments and droplets. It has {{enormous}} applications in industries and processes such as combustion, heat transfer systems, transport, biological systems and particularly our interest, coating processes. The Effervescent nozzle {{is a type of}} twin-fluid atomizer and has shown a superior performance in handling and spraying different liquids without any clogging issues; which is particularly interesting in thermal spray. In spite of significant number of experimental works, a few numerical works have been carried out. That makes it crucial to conduct a comprehensive numerical study on Effervescent atomizer. The complex internal and external behaviors of Effervescent atomizer are governing the behavior of the flow. The latter is a turbulent and compressible multiphase flow. It is studied numerically by employing a three-dimensional compressible Eulerian method along with Volume of Fluid (VOF) surface-tracking method coupled with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model. The numerical study is conducted by using OpenFoam library, an open-source package introduced by Open-CFD. In this study, the effect of varying the gas to liquid ratio (GLR) and the suspension (i. e. effect of viscosity, density and surface tension), on the structure of internal flow and consequently, the external flow is studied numerically. It is observed that the increase in GLR is accompanied with an evolution of the internal flow from a complex bubbly flow to an annular flow. This reduces the liquid film thickness at the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice.</b> Further studies on internal pressure illustrated the critical condition, choked flow and pressure oscillations at the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice.</b> The examination of increasing the GLR and evolving of internal flow resulted in changing in primary atomization parameters such as shortening the breakup length and widening the spray cone angle.

Moreover, alternation of the liquid properties illustrated the higher spray velocity and wider cone angle of the spray, which demonstrates the superior performance of the Effervescent atomizer...|$|R
40|$|All {{previous}} studies of effervescent atomization have concentrated on measurements of the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the spray under conditions where the air-liquid mixture is discharged into air at normal atmospheric pressure. A new atomization test facility has been constructed for the interrogation of sprays at elevated ambient pressures. Measurements of mean drop size in sprays injected into air at pressures up to 1 MPa (10 atm) were conducted by locating an effervescent atomizer in a high pressure tank fitted with observation windows. A Malvern particle analyzer {{was used to measure}} mean drop sizes over wide ranges of ambient air pressure, atomizing gas/liquid mass ratio, liquid injection pressure, liquid viscosity, surface tension and atomizer <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter. It was found that continuous increase in ambient air pressure above the normal atmospheric value causes the mean drop size to first increase up to a maximum value and then decline. An explanation for this characteristic was derived in terms of the various contributing factors to the overall atomization process. It was also observed that mean drop sizes and drop size distributions are virtually independent of nozzle <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter at all levels of ambient air pressure. ^ The flow instability and flow regimes inside the mixing tube and at the exit orifice of the atomizer were also exmaiend in this study. A correlation for exit <b>orifice</b> <b>discharge</b> coefficient was found to represent the experimental results. A relationship between the atomizer pressure ratio and upstream conditions was also derived. This relationship allows the determination of flow conditions at the exit of the final orifice. ^ The effects of variations in atomizer geometry and operating conditions on spray cone angle were also investigated. It was found that the sprays produced by a single-orifice effervescent atomizer have relatively narrow cone angles, ranging from 15 to 23 degrees. It was also noted that an increase in ambient air pressure above the normal atmospheric value results in a reduction in spray cone angle although the change is small. Equations for predicting the mean drop size of a spray were sought based on the conservation equations of mass and energy for a gas-liquid two-phase flow. These equations were found to predict reasonably well the Sauter mean diameters of sprays produced by effervescent atomization. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

Since the influence of the value of <pe on the limiting values for mass flow is small, one can conclude that tests with the flow factor tester give correct results regarding the minimum in-clination of hopper walls for mass flow to occur. 2. The unconfined yield strength / „ affects the minimum size of the <b>discharge</b> <b>orifice</b> making doming of material in the hopper impossible. The values of fc and therefore the minimum sizes of the orifice become greater when using the correct results of the sim-ple shear apparatus. In spite of lacking agreement the hoppers designed after Jenikes method are working without difficulties. The only conclusion can be that the safety factor entering th...|$|R
