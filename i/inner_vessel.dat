50|$|Typically cryostats are {{manufactured}} with two vessels, one inside the other. The outer vessel is evacuated with the vacuum {{acting as a}} thermal insulator. The <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> contains the cryogen and is supported within the outer vessel by structures made from low-conductivity materials. An intermediate shield between the outer and inner vessels intercepts the heat radiated from the outer vessel. This heat is removed by a cryocooler. Older helium cryostats used a liquid nitrogen vessel as this radiation shield and had the liquid helium in an inner, third, vessel. Nowadays few units using multiple cryogens are made with the trend being towards 'cryogen-free' cryostats in which all heat loads are removed by cryocoolers.|$|E

40|$|The {{waste package}} {{design for the}} License Application is a double-wall waste package {{underneath}} a protective drip shield (BSC 2004 [DIRS 168489]; BSC 2004 [DIRS 169480]). The purpose and scope of this model report is to document models for general and localized corrosion of the waste package outer barrier (WPOB) {{to be used in}} evaluating waste package performance. The WPOB is constructed of Alloy 22 (UNS N 06022), a highly corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloy. The <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> of the waste package is constructed of Stainless Steel Type 316 (UNS S 31600). Before it fails, the Alloy 22 WPOB protects the Stainless Steel Type 316 <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> from exposure to the external environment and any significant degradation. The Stainless Steel Type 316 <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> provides structural stability to the thinner Alloy 22 WPOB. Although the waste package <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> would also provide some performance for waste containment and potentially decrease the rate of radionuclide transport after WPOB breach before it fails, the potential performance of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> is far less than that of the more corrosion-resistant Alloy 22 WPOB. For this reason, the corrosion performance of the waste package <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> is conservatively ignored in this report and the total system performance assessment for the license application (TSPA-LA). Treatment of seismic and igneous events and their consequences on waste package outer barrier performance are not specifically discussed in this report, although the general and localized corrosion models developed in this report are suitable for use in these scenarios. The localized corrosion processes considered in this report are pitting corrosion and crevice corrosion.

The test apparatus is a fluid boil-off calorimeter system for calibrated measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity (k-value) of a specimen material at a fixed vacuum level.

40|$|The vacuum {{isolation}} {{vessel and}} method {{in accordance with}} the present invention are used to accurately measure thermal noise in microphones. The apparatus and method could be used in a microphone calibration facility or any facility used for testing microphones. Thermal noise is measured to determine the minimum detectable sound pressure by the microphone. Conventional isolation apparatus and methods have been unable to provide an acoustically quiet and substantially vibration free environment for accurately measuring thermal noise. In the present invention, an isolation vessel assembly comprises a vacuum sealed outer vessel, a vacuum sealed <b>inner</b> <b>vessel,</b> and an interior suspension assembly coupled between the outer and inner vessels for suspending the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> within the outer vessel. A noise measurement system records thermal noise data from the isolation vessel assembly. A vacuum system creates a vacuum between an internal surface of the outer vessel and an external surface of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel.</b> The present invention thus provides an acoustically quiet environment due to the vacuum created between the inner and outer vessels and a substantially vibration free environment due to the suspension assembly suspending the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> within the outer vessel.

The core deformation, caused by dynamic condition like the seismic motion, may determine, at large or small extent, an assembly compaction generally characterized by a radial inward displacement, and subsequently result in a possible insertion of reactivity. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the deformation of core (and restraint system) geometry of the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator - ALFRED (300 MWth). Numerical analyses have been carried out by the finite element MSC©Marc code to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the overall reactor system and, specifically, of the main components of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel,</b> such as the lower and upper grid, the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel,</b> the support skirt, etc [...] Suitable boundary and initial conditions, such as that one related to the core sub-assemblies mass, the restrictions imposed to the geometrical in-structures connections, etc. have been assumed to numerically investigate the dynamic response of the structures, since confidence was established by sensitivity analyses of size and type of the adopted elements.

Histologic evaluation was performed after 3 weeks. Intimal thickening (more than five cell layers of neointima) 3 weeks after treatment occurred more frequently after passage of the balloon than after any of the other procedures (P <. 001).

40|$|This report calculates {{the effect}} of the conductances of the pumping lines on the pumping speeds of the vacuum pumps being used to pump the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel,</b> and annular space, vacuum tight during the CC Cryostat testing. Effective pumping speeds were {{calculated}} for various values of pressure via the above stated formulas (see calculations). Conductances of valves, elbows, and tees were calculated with the help of ref. 1, and the volumes of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> and annular space were calculated wtth the aid of ref. 2. The major results of these calculations follow. The attached graphs show the effective pumping speed vs. pressure, as well as the pressure vs. pumpdown time for both the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> pumpdown and the annular space pumpdown. Many intervals of pressure were chosen in order to give a complete picture of the effects on the pumping speed, and pumpdown time. An important rule of thumb is that the effective pumping speed be close to the intrinsic pump speed in the region of interest for the best efficiency. With an infinite conductance, these quantities become equal. In the case of the annular space pumpdown. the effective pumping speed is within approximately 15 % of the intrinsic pump speed for pressures down to 6000 {mu}, and at that point, the conductance effects slow the system down and provide a 49 % difference at 1000 {mu}. To Improve these numbers, the line length must be shortened, or even better, the line diameter increased. As far as pumpdown time is concerned, the actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time, and would have been even better if the pumping system did not lag due to a leaK and its repair time. The <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> pumpdown shows a pumpdown time near 1 hour to reach 100 {mu} pressure. The effective pumping speed matches to within 10 % of the intrinsic pump speed to 6000 {mu}, and then the conductance effects become more important and provide a 41 % difference at 1000 {mu}. The actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time which demonstrates that the pump used was in fact adequate for this application...|$|E
40|$|The saline {{oscillator}} {{consists of}} an <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> containing salt water partially immersed in an outer vessel of fresh water, with a small orifice {{in the center of}} the bottom of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel.</b> There is a cyclic alternation between salt water flowing downwards out of the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> into the outer vessel through the orifice and fresh water flowing upwards into the <b>inner</b> <b>vessel</b> from the outer vessel through that same orifice. We develop a very stable _i. e., stationary_ version of this saline oscillator. We first investigate the response of the oscillator to periodic forcing with a train of stimuli _period=Tp_ of large amplitude. Each stimulus is the quick injection of a fixed volume of fresh water into the outer vessel followed immediately by withdrawal of that very same volume. For Tp sufficiently close to the intrinsic period of the oscillator _T 0 _, there is 1 : 1 synchronization or phase locking between the stimulus train and the oscillator. As Tp is decreased below T 0, one finds the succession of phase-locking rhythms: 1 : 1, 2 : 2, 2 : 1, 2 : 2, and 1 : 1. As Tp is increased beyond T 0, one encounters successively 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 2 : 4, 2 : 3, 2 : 4, and 1 : 2 phase-locking rhythms. We next investigate the phase-resetting response, in which injection of a single stimulus transiently changes the period of the oscillation. By systematically changing the phase of the cycle at which the stimulus is delivered _the old phase_, we construct the new-phase—old-phase curve _the phase transition curve_, from which we then develop a one-dimensional finite-difference equation _“map”_ that predicts the response to periodic stimulation. These predicted phaselocking rhythms are close to the experimental findings. In addition, iteration of the map predicts the existence of bistability between two different 1 : 1 rhythms, which was then searched for and found experimentally. Bistability between 1 : 1 and 2 : 2 rhythms is also encountered. Finally, with one exception, numerical modeling with a phenomenologically derived Rayleigh oscillator reproduces all of the experimental behavior...|$|E
