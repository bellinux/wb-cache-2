25|$|During {{inquiries}} into {{natural gas}} exports in the 1950s, the ERCB recommended {{the creation of}} a province-wide natural gas <b>gathering</b> <b>system.</b> The thinking behind this idea was twofold: first, it would be more efficient to develop a single <b>gathering</b> <b>system</b> than to let gathering systems evolve piecemeal. Second, such a system would eliminate the possibility of federal regulation of gas within the province. Alberta was jealous of its hard-won control over natural resources and saw gas transportation within the province as an aspect of resource management.

25|$|There {{were many}} reasons for the {{creation}} of AGTL. One was that the provincial government considered it sensible to have a single <b>gathering</b> <b>system</b> in Alberta to feed export pipelines, rather than a number of separate networks. Another was that pipelines crossing provincial boundaries and those leaving the country fall under federal jurisdiction. By creating a separate entity to carry gas within Alberta, the provincial government stopped Ottawa's authority at the border. Incorporated in 1954, AGTL issued public shares in 1957. The company later restructured as NOVA Corporation, sold its pipeline assets (now primarily operated by TransCanada Corporation), and transformed itself into NOVA Chemicals.|$|E
