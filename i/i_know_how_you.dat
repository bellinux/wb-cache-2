6000|$|... "Don't do it--stay {{here and}} fight it out. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel--I {{felt that way}} when they called me 'a poorhouse nobody.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, lad, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel. But {{every moment}} is precious. We must hasten {{to the post}} and prepare for the attack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Amelia, you {{are very}} unwell," [...] the visitor said, putting forth her hand to take Amelia's. [...] "What is it? I could not rest until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forget you, lady; {{and even the}} black water will not quite {{separate}} us. As <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> were in prison, so <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are in your home in England. What we have done is little. Did not the sahib risk his life for me? My father and I will never forget what we owe him. I am glad {{to know that you}} will make him happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't all my fault," [...] he said. [...] "You didn't {{have to take}} a drink." [...] His voice fell to {{a pathetic}} whimper. [...] "I was showing you {{hospitality}} the best way <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how.</b> <b>You</b> won't never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> hurt my feelin's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Granger, the {{occasion}} is too serious for polite fibs. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> saved my life. I {{do not know}} how to thank you for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's all right,' said Una. 'I'm {{getting on}} for thirteen. I've never been whipped, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> felt. All the same, {{it must have}} been funny!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahuh!... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel. But, boy, I'd rather {{live with}} one leg an' be loved by Collie Belllounds than have nine legs for some other lass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} sleep until <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> had fared,' said he. 'I have paid a price for my papers. There are not {{so many of my}} old {{soldiers}} left that I can afford to lose two in one night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Maxwell {{turned white}} with anger. [...] "I didn't {{try to make}} her think I did, anyway. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> really felt, and I don't believe you deceived her very much, either. All the same I was ashamed to see you try." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ecod!' he answered. 'Pecksniff if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{meant to}} leave your money, I could {{put you in the}} way of {{doubling}} it in no time. It wouldn't be bad to keep a chance like this snug in the family. But you're such a deep one!' ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE (turning to BERT). Well, here's wishing you luck, Bert, {{and hoping}} we'll meet over there. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel,--you {{want to be}} in it, just as I do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> mean. You feel {{something}} like what I did in England. You can't get next {{to what the}} folks are thinking, {{and it makes you}} sort of lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, now, dear George, that {{is really}} wicked! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel about losing your place in the factory, {{and you have a}} hard master; but pray be patient, and perhaps something--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I read, and I mystified myself. The better I talked, {{the more}} my own {{convictions}} failed me; and, {{by the time}} you came up to Oxford, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> would have shrunk from him who was your pride, if you could have seen into the secrets beneath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he continued, [...] "I am {{not only}} bad, but I admire badness. My wish {{is to remain}} bad--in fact, I should like to be worse if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how.</b> <b>You</b> would {{find it hard to}} make a start. I couldn't even admit that a state of {{goodness}} was desirable!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Giulietta, io so quanto soffri (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much <b>you</b> are suffering, Giulietta) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am glad!" [...] Kate exclaimed. [...] "You know, Captain Whitney, that I {{was sure}} of your innocence; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> must have longed {{for it to be}} proved to the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never felt}} {{the way you}} did about Rogers, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> always did feel, and I guess I {{surprised}} him with my answer. He had brought along a lot of stock as security----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yuh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> mean. And it's {{good of you}} to like beating {{it around}} with me. But you sure got the exaggerated idee of me. And you'd get sick of the holes I'm likely to land in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{would feel}} about it, {{and that was}} why I didn't dare to tell you, and why we fixed up this story about old Brackett. I couldn't bear to live on you any longer, and to see you {{roughing}} it here, when we might be having all the money we wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} I {{think that it}} is {{probable}} that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> reach your results." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. Oh, {{something}} dreadful, sir, really. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> {{can take}} an interest in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> see it," [...] she {{answered}} with despairing self-suppression. [...] "But I {{am going to}} marry him again, {{as it would be}} called by you. Strictly speaking you, too--don't mind my saying it, Jude!--you should take back--Arabella." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, uncle," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "I {{have come}} to look on these things a little differently. Many years ago, in America, I used to wonder {{what it was that}} kept you apart from every one else, kept the smile from your lips, made you accept good fortune or ill without any sign of feeling. I was too young to {{understand}} then, but I realise everything now. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> denied yourself to send me to school and college. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> left yourself almost a beggar when you gave me the chance of my life and trusted me with all your savings. These things I shall never forget." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} me the happiest man in the world," [...] he said. [...] "I can't stop a moment longer--I should simply say extravagant things. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel. It isn't quite time for them yet. But you'll send for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Grace,--I think <b>you</b> must. <b>I</b> hardly <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> can refuse. He is an {{intimate}} friend of everybody here at Framley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Louise, {{if you say}} that, {{you will}} simply drive me to despair, for <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> will feel when he doesn't--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always do}} think, my lord, {{that there is}} nothing like sport to cement affection. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel about it, my lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|She whispered, [...] "Never mind, dear. I don't care. It was all {{twice as}} much fun as being wheeled in lacy prams by cranky nurses, as Jeff and I were. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel. Are you ashamed of having been a prairie pirate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A queen she is, {{and a great}} one, for in {{our land}} Khania means queen, though how, friend Holly, {{a man who has}} lain {{senseless}} can have learned this, I do not know. Nor do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> come to speak our language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "I {{will be very}} kind--be sure of that. And I {{will see}} Mr. Townsend to-morrow. Meanwhile, and for the present, be so good as to mention to no one that you are engaged." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> devoted <b>you</b> are to your son. I didn't believe you'd stick at {{anything}} when his interests were at stake. I'm sorry, Christina.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are {{to put up}} with a pink-eyed parson, and a hum-drum life," [...] said Julius, {{holding out}} a caressing hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{say much}} now, Gertrude, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good <b>you</b> are; {{you will come}} and see me, if they will let you, won't you?' ...|$|R
