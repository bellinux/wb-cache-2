50|$|Late in 1915, the Military Council of the IRB <b>set</b> the <b>date</b> of The Rising as Easter Sunday. This {{information}} {{was not made}} available to anyone other than the members of that sub-committee, and especially not the IRB Supreme Council leader, Eoin MacNeill. With the <b>date</b> <b>set</b> and the <b>wheels</b> starting to be in motion, there remained one further obstacle that may have spoiled their plans. James Connolly, leader of the Irish Citizens Army, was making noise that he would strike the first blow before the Irish Volunteers and the IRB. In order to quiet him down, and put off imminent arrests by Dublin Castle, a meeting was arranged on 19 January between Connolly {{and several of the}} Military Council members, including Patrick Pearse, Tom Clarke, Éamonn Ceannt, Seán Mac Diarmada and Joseph Plunkett. This meeting, in a home in Dolphin's Barn, lasted for three days. By its end on 22 January, Connolly had become convinced to quiet down on publicly calling for a rising, committed his Citizens Army to the plans and timeline developed by the IRB Military Council, was sworn into the IRB and posted to the Military Council. During all this time, none of Connolly’s people knew where he was. Upon his return, he remained tight-lipped about it all, including to his close friends and his wife. Various stories emerged, including those of his kidnapping by the IRB and his saying he had simply gone “walking in the country”.|$|R

The selenium cell exposure meter is now coupled to a [...] "setting wheel" [...] located on {{the very bottom of}} the lens mount. This <b>setting</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> adjusts the camera's exposure value (EV) by changing (in a most complex fashion) the aperture and/or shutter rings {{at the same time that}} it changes the depth-of-field pointers on the camera's lens.

The current invention is an omnidirectional, remote-controlled mobility apparatus, {{similar to}} a wheelchair, which allows the transport of an individual or object(s). The device includes a cubic-shaped base with wheel wells on each vertical side of said base. Within each wheel well is a <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> such that {{the front and rear}} <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other and the left and right <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other. The circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> includes a plurality of transverse-facing, smaller wheels disposed incrementally within each <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> along the circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> such that a portion of the smaller wheels protrude outside the circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set.</b> This allows the mobility apparatus to propel in any direction.

40|$|Workload control (WLC) is a {{production}} planning and control concept developed for make-to-order companies. Its customer enquiry management methodology supports due <b>date</b> <b>setting,</b> while its order release mechanism determines when to start production. For make-to-order companies, due <b>date</b> <b>setting</b> is a strategically important, complex task where unconfirmed jobs place demands on capacity which are contingent on a quotation being {{accepted by the}} customer. Yet most prior WLC research has begun at the order release stage {{with a set of}} confirmed orders with predetermined due dates. In contrast, this paper focuses specifically on customer enquiry management and uses simulation to compare and contrast the performance of 11 due <b>date</b> <b>setting</b> rules in a job shop where part of the workload consists of unconfirmed or contingent orders. The best results are achieved by a finite loading rule which explicitly considers the workload of contingent orders when estimating lead times. This enables demand to be levelled over time, allowing due dates to be short and reliable - thereby improving both the competitiveness of a make-to-order company and the customer service level it is able to offer. Future research should focus on integrating customer enquiry management, and its due <b>date</b> <b>setting</b> rule, with order release control. ...|$|R
