5|$|Although known {{mostly for}} his work <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, Koppelman's painterly {{interest}} in color took a new form in the 1970s, when he began using color in his prints. After 1980, he worked increasingly in pastel and watercolor.|$|E
40|$|Several reports {{indicate}} that erythrocytes (RBCs) from <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men have higher sodium concentrations than those from whites and women. One possible mechanism to explain this finding is {{a difference in the}} activity of Na+-K+-ATPase. To explore this possibility, we have studied the Na+ and K+ kinetics of RBC Na+-K+-ATPase and RBC Na+ and K+ concentrations <b>in</b> 37 normotensive <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, both males and females. The maximal initial reaction velocity (Vmax) values for RBC Na+-K+-ATPase were lower <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men as compared with whites and women. Higher RBC Na+ levels were observed <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> males vs. whites and females. Significant inverse correlations were noted between the Na+-K+-ATPase activity and RBC Na+ concentrations. These findings indicate that cellular Na+ homeostasis is different <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men as compared with whites and women. Since higher RBC Na+ concentrations have also been observed in patients with essential hypertension as compared with normotensive subjects, the higher intracellular Na+ concentrations <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> men may contribute to the greater predisposition of these groups to essential hypertension...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the variation in}} the risk of AIDS <b>in</b> US <b>Blacks,</b> Hispanics, <b>and</b> other racial/ethnic groups relative to that in Whites (non-Hispanic) by geographic area and mode of acquiring HIV infection, based on data reported between June 1, 1981 and January 18, 1988 to the Centers for Disease Control and 1980 US census data. Relative risks (RRs) <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> Hispanics were highest in the northeast region, and higher in suburbs than in central cities of metropolitan areas. RRs <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> Hispanics were greatest for AIDS directly or indirectly associated with intravenous-drug abuse by heterosexuals (range: 5. 7 - 26. 9) and were also high for AIDS associated with male bisexuality (range: 2. 5 - 4. 8), suggesting that these behaviors may be more prevalent <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> Hispanics than <b>in</b> Whites. Prevention strategies should take into account these racial/ethnic differences...|$|R

The percentages of mentholated cigarette users were much higher <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> Asians than <b>in</b> Whites, especially in the younger age groups. A marked inverse relationship between mentholated cigarette use and age was present <b>in</b> <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> Asians; mentholated cigarette use showed little difference with age in Whites...|$|R

The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary critics {{gave the}} song mixed reviews, some {{claiming}} {{it to be}} Allen's sweetest lyrical moments, while others accuse it of being a fraud. The single peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Singles Chart, being her first single not {{to reach the top}} twenty in the United Kingdom. The accompanying music video portrayed a view over the mundane moments of a dying relationship, with Allen watching herself and her ex-boyfriend together. It was directed by Nima Nourizadeh and was mainly shot <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white. The song was performed live during her 2007 concert tour and also during her 2009 concert tour.|$|E
5|$|Don Calò Vizzini died on July 10, 1954, {{at the age}} of 76, while {{entering}} Villalba in {{an ambulance}} that was transporting him home from a clinic in Palermo.

40|$|The Metabolic Syndrome poses an {{important}} public health {{threat to the}} U. S. health care delivery system. Disparate access to quality health care makes African Americans (blacks) especially susceptible to the adverse effects of MS. Although direct evidence suggests that early treatment of MS risk factors saves lives, no study to date has compared the cost effectiveness of such measures <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the general population. Interventions that promote early treatment of MS risk factors may improve public health but could also lead to excess costs that are ultimately borne by society. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the value of early treatment of MS risk factors <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the general population. A cost effectiveness analysis was carried out using a Markov decision model to compare early treatment and late treatment of MS risk factors <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the general population. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). With the exception of early treatment of hyperlipidemia <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> (187, 462 /QALY), early treatment of individual MS risk factors at age 30 was found to be cost effective (3 ̆c 27, 000 /QALY) for both <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the general population. With the exception of treatment of hyperlipidemia, early treatment strategies targeted at blacks were found to be more cost effective than those targeted towards the general population. Sensitivity analyses indicated that age and cost of treatment were the most influential factors in the model. The cost effectiveness of early treatment of MS risk factors <b>in</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> the general population compares favorably with similar health care interventions. The results support a growing body of literature that indicates the cost effectiveness of providing preventative services to apparently healthy individuals...|$|R

5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again <b>in</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} {{the inclusion of a}} short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E
