40|$|In {{order to}} study geodynamics in {{relation}} to atmospheric, oceanographic and glaciological interactions on a global scale, adequate distribution of precise geodesy stations over the Earth is important.

Unfortunately, many preliminary design workbooks for this period were considered no longer essential and consequently destroyed in the mid-1970s.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} that the transposition of data from printouts to data collection sheets, and the subsequent manipulation of this data with measurement values, is an obvious error source in optical tooling projects. Ideas for computerized data collection have been under consideration for some time, yet they lacked the versatility needed {{for even the most}} typical optical tooling jobs. Surveyors experienced with optical tooling were used to designing the measurement strategy that worked best for each job. There was no canned formula that worked with every case. After extensive field testing a program was developed that worked in as many cases as possible. The program contains ideal files for components and monumentation, <b>format</b> <b>sheets</b> for set-up and measurement of components, and a summary sheet of work accomplished so far.

USE - The fine tubular pore canals {{resulting from the}} plant lumen are filled with gases and/or liquids for storage, intermediate storage and transport (claimed). The moldings are also useful in machine, especially vehicle construction, e. g. for brakes and bearings. ADVANTAGE - The great variability of the structure and properties of the material {{can be used to}} suit to various requirements. Fibrous or isotropic carbon and fibrous silicon carbide composite materials can be made. The materials are suitable for plastic molding in the green stage and allow technical and cost-effective production of large <b>format</b> <b>sheets.</b> The number of process stages, energy consumption and cost of machining are reduced.
