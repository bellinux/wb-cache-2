40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract uses {{a system of}} tolerance and controlled inflammation to limit the response to dietary or bacteria-derived antigens in the gut. When this complex system breaks down, either by a chemical or pathogenic insult in a genetically predisposed individual the resulting immune response may lead to inflammatory bowel disease. Although the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease remains unsolved current evidence indicates that defective T-cell apoptosis and impairment of intestinal epithelial barrier function play important roles. In inflammatory bowel disease, {{it has been reported}} that activation of macrophages seems to be as important as increased production of the macrophage-derived cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL- 1 and IL- 6. The triggering factor for this cascade is still to be elucidated as to whether it represents an auto-antigen or a <b>hetero-antigen.</b> It has been also demonstrated that a serologic anti-microbial response exists. This response includes antibodies against saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), E. coli outer membrane porin C (Omp-C), flagelin (cBir 1) and pseudomonas aeroginosa (I 2). Host response to microbial pathogens includes self-defense mechanisms including defensins, pattern recognition receptors and Toll-like receptors. Neuroimmunomodulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is another interesting approach with implications on the influence of brain-gut axis on intestinal inflammation and its perpetuation. It is probable that inflammatory bowel disease represents a heterogenic group of diseases that share similar mechanisms of tissue damage but have different initiating events and immunoregulatory abnormalities. A better understanding of all these events will hopefully provide new insights into the mechanisms of epithelial responses to microorganisms and ideas for therapies...|$|E
