5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under carefully controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society {{in the town of}} Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1961, {{conferences}} {{were held}} at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful reconciliation between the secessionist factions and the central government {{in the face of}} a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula, the chief organiser of the South Kasai state, in July hastened internal collapse.|$|E
5|$|Initially, many {{physicists}} {{hoped that}} by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The {{hope was that}} such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that {{the laws of physics}} appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as chirality. Edward Witten and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> construct an electronic brain.|$|E

50|$|One {{technology}} {{that has been}} proposed to achieve higher speeds is an E-sail. By harnessing solar wind, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> achieve 20-30 AU per year without even using propellant.|$|R
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated {{that the government would}} support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane solution would be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

50|$|Audio latency {{over the}} Internet {{is too high}} for {{practical}} real-time coordination of musicians. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> {{in the future to}} have real time collaboration within a radius of about 1000 km.|$|R
25|$|Scientists {{and authors}} have {{postulated}} {{a number of}} ways by which <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> surpass the speed of light, but even the most serious-minded of these are highly speculative.|$|E
25|$|Others such as Herbert E. Ives {{argued that}} <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{experimentally}} determine {{the motion of}} such an aether, {{but it was never}} found despite numerous experimental tests of Lorentz invariance (see tests of special relativity).|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the affinities of Gumillea if DNA could be {{extracted from the}} existing specimen.

25|$|Several studies {{funded by}} the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts are {{exploring}} whether <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the Van Allen belt of the Earth, and ultimately, the belts of gas giants, like Jupiter, hopefully {{at a lower cost}} per gram.|$|E
50|$|Many {{researchers}} <b>are</b> {{unaware that}} <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> {{for them to}} have all the research articles they need, and just accept it as fate that they will always be without some of the articles they would like to read.|$|R

60|$|At last, Ned {{thought he}} saw a passage {{between two of the}} big rocks, through which <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> he thought, that they might swim, and so avoid the certain death which seemed to await them at every other spot.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> print organs, or {{possibly}} entire organisms using additive manufacturing techniques. A recent innovative method of construction uses an ink-jet mechanism to print precise layers of cells in {{a matrix of}} thermoreversible gel. Endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels, have been printed {{in a set of}} stacked rings. When incubated, these fused into a tube.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{reconcile}} {{these different}} sentiments {{by stating that}} if it be an established fact that St. Basil instituted and organized the Hour of Compline for the East, as St. Benedict did for the West, there existed {{as early as the}} days of St. Cyprian and Clement of Alexandria the custom of reciting a prayer before sleep, in which practice we find the most remote origin of our Compline.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{this idea}} often say this {{approach}} is overly broad in scope. However, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> constrain the fitness criterion onto a general class of results, and so obtain an evolved GP that would more efficiently produce results for sub-classes. This might {{take the form of}} a meta evolved GP for producing human walking algorithms which is then used to evolve human running, jumping, etc. The fitness criterion applied to the meta GP would simply be one of efficiency.|$|E
