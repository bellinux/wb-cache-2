40|$|Abstract Although {{diabetes}} mellitus is predominantly a metabolic disorder, recent {{data suggest that}} it is as much a vascular disorder. Cardiovascular complications are {{the leading cause of death}} and disability in patients with {{diabetes mellitus}}. A number of recent reports have emphasized that many patients already have atherosclerosis in progression by the time they are diagnosed with clinical evidence of diabetes mellitus. The increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients is related to the frequently associated dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and endothelial dysfunction. The evolving knowledge regarding the variety of metabolic, hormonal, and hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with diabetes mellitus has led to efforts designed for early identification of individuals at risk of subsequent disease. It has been suggested that insulin resistance, the key abnormality in type II diabetes, often precedes clinical features of diabetes by 5 – 6 years. Careful attention to the criteria described for the cardiovascular <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> should help identify those at risk at an early stage. The application of nonpharmacologic as well as newer emerging pharmacologic therapies can have beneficial effects in individuals with cardiovascular <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and/or diabetes mellitus by improving insulin sensitivity and related abnormalities. Early identification and implementation of appropriate therapeutic strategies would be necessary to contain the emerging new epidemic of cardiovascular disease related to diabetes. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} of a model for evaluating dairy cow ration efficiency. This model took into account technical, metabolic, and economic parameters, which were divided into two main categories: input and output. Feeding (food administered and its nutritional characteristics) was considered as the input parameter. The output indicators were directly or indirectly correlated with feeding, and included: quality and quantity of milk, body condition score, live weight, reproductive parameters, incidence of animal diseases (laminitis), undigested fraction, fecal consistency, feed efficiency (FE), and income over feed cost (IOFC). The model was validated using ten dairy farms located in the northwest of Basilicata. The farms were divided into two groups (A and B) {{as a function of the}} urea level in bulk milk. In Group A, the urea level was between 25 and 31 mg/ 100 mL milk, whereas, in Group B, the range was 21 - 22. 5 mg/ 100 mL milk. The model showed that the values of reproductive parameters were worse in Group A than in Group B. However, the Group A showed better milk qualitative and quantitative characteristics, such as a high average production per head (28. 15 vs 26. 93 kg), and a high fat (3. 92 vs 3. 71 %) and protein (3. 53 vs 3. 37 %) content of bulk milk. Moreover, the highest values of FE (1. 45 vs 1. 35 kg milk/kg dry matter) and IOFC (6. 07 vs 5. 32 €) were found in Group A. The model clearly showed that the administration of unbalanced rations, based on the physiological stage of the animals, negatively affected both the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of milk, as well as the reproductive performances. The administration of unbalanced rations for the energy/protein content caused <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> which led to a reduction of both FE and IOFC.

METHODS: The relationship between magnetic resonance imaging assessed liver iron concentration (LIC) and plasma ferritin levels with total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone (BT), SHBG and LH levels, were studied in 50 men with moderate dysmetabolic iron excess, in the absence of genetic haemochromatosis, who were randomised to phlebotomy therapy or to normal care. RESULTS: Four patients (8 %) had low total testosterone (< 10. 4  nmol/l) and 13 patients (26 %) had low BT (< 2. 5  nmol/l). In the entire population, those with LIC above the median (90  μmol/l) had a higher mean SHBG (P= 0. 028), lower LH (P= 0. 039) than those with LIC below the median. In multivariable analysis (adjusted for age, and fasting insulin) LIC was significantly associated with SHBG (positively) and LH (negatively). Patients in the highest quartile of SHBG had higher LIC (P= 0. 010) and higher ferritinaemia (P= 0. 012) than those in the three other quartiles. Iron depletion by venesection did not significantly improve any hormonal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogonadism is not infrequent in men with <b>dysmetabolic</b> iron overload <b>syndrome.</b> Liver iron excess is associated with increased plasma SHBG and moderate hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.

40|$|Low {{levels of}} {{high-density}} lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are frequently encountered {{in patients with}} coronary artery disease (CAD), most often in combination with elevated triglycerides {{as part of a}} <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Although no large secondary prevention trials with statin therapy with special emphasis on low HDL-C have been performed, some guidance can be extracted from a number of post-hoc analyses on how to treat patients with low levels of HDL-C. In terms of risk reduction, statin therapy appears to be at least as effective in patients with low compared to normal HDL-C levels. Fibrate therapy seems only effective when low HDL-C coincides with a level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the low-normal range. Before considering combination therapy of statins with fibrates, much emphasis should be put on dietary changes, weight reduction, smoking cessation and regular exercise, since these measures are effective tools to raise HDL-C levels. Moreover, one {{should be aware of the}} fact that combination therapy of statins and fibrates is not evidence-based and confers some potential risk of myopathy. Future therapy options may include CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) inhibitors, but these agents are still in an experimental phase. As most patients with low HDL-C levels share features of the <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> one could also consider a combination therapy of statins and ACE-inhibitors, since this combination is not only safe, but the individual preventive effects of these compounds appear to be cumulative.

Here, we addressed the potential role for FOXC 2 as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes and associated phenotypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was performed in 390 type 2 diabetic patients and 307 control subjects. The number of patients was increased to a total of 768 subjects for further study of phenotypic differences relating to the <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> relative to genetic variation. The FOXC 2 - 512 C > T polymorphism was genotyped by a restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR assay. RESULTS: FOXC 2 - 512 C > T allele and genotype distribution did not differ between patients with type 2 diabetes and control subjects, but the C/C genotype was associated with increased body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) (P-a = 0. 03) among type 2 diabetic patients. The FOXC 2 - 512 C > T polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of BMI (P = 0. 001) in a multiple regression model including age, gender and affection status. We found no significant association with type 2 diabetes-related metabolic parameters but that the C-allele (P = 0. 01) and C/C and C/T genotypes (P = 0. 03) were significantly over-represented in type 2 diabetic males with a concomitant diagnosis of <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSION: We conclude that FOXC 2 is associated with obesity and metabolic deterioration but does not contribute to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes...|$|E

Cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 activity was measured at baseline {{and at the end}} of treatment by using the 6 -hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone blood metabolic ratio, 2 h after the intake of 500 mg of chlorzoxazone. RESULTS: In the treatment group, a mean of 3. 9 +/- 1. 3 L of blood was removed and serum ferritin levels dropped from 715 +/- 397 to 74 +/- 34 microg/L. Variation of cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 activity was not significantly different between the 2 groups (0. 07 +/- 0. 26 vs. 0. 03 +/- 0. 19, P = 0. 36). In the treatment group, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and vitamin E were lowered after treatment compared with control group (- 0. 15 +/- 0. 51 vs. 0. 24 +/- 0. 58, P = 0. 002 and - 1. 3 +/- 4. 4 vs. 2. 3 +/- 5. 2, P = 0. 03, respectively).

40|$|Increased serum {{ferritin}} {{associated with}} mild hepatic iron accumulation, despite preserved upregulation {{of the iron}} hormone hepcidin, is frequently observed in patients with <b>dysmetabolic</b> overload <b>syndrome</b> (DIOS). Genetic factors and Western diet represent predisposing conditions, but the mechanisms favoring iron accumulation in DIOS are still unclear. Aims {{of this study were}} to assess the effect a high-fat diet (HFD) on hepatic iron metabolism in an experimental model in rats, to further characterize the effect of free fatty acids on iron metabolism in HepG 2 hepatocytes in vitro, and to assess the translational relevance in patients with fatty liver with and without iron accumulation. Despite decreased uptake of dietary iron, rats fed HFD accumulated more hepatic iron than those fed regular diet, which was associated with steatosis development. Hepatic iron accumulation was paralleled by induction of ferritin, in the presence of preserved upregulation of hepcidin, recapitulating the features of DIOS. HFD was associated with increased expression of the major iron uptake protein Transferrin receptor- 1 (TfR- 1), consistently with upregulation of the intracellular iron sensor Iron regulated protein- 1 (IRP 1). Supplementation with fatty acids induced TfR- 1 and IRP 1 in HepG 2 hepatocytes, favoring intracellular iron accumulation following exposure to iron salts. IRP 1 silencing completely abrogated TfR- 1 induction and the facilitation of intracellular iron accumulation induced by fatty acids. Hepatic TfR- 1 mRNA levels were upregulated in patients with fatty liver and DIOS, whereas they were not associated with liver fat nor with inflammation. In conclusion, increased exposure to fatty acids subverts hepatic iron metabolism, favoring the induction of an iron uptake program despite hepatocellular iron accumulation...|$|R

Circulating factors (holotransferrin, cytokines, erythroid regulators) might variably contribute to hepcidin modulation in different pathological conditions. There are few studies analysing the relationship between hepcidin transcript and related protein expression profiles in humans. Our aims were: a. to measure hepcidin expression at either hepatic, serum and urinary level in three paradigmatic iron overload conditions (hemochromatosis, thalassemia and <b>dysmetabolic</b> iron overload <b>syndrome)</b> and in controls; b. to measure mRNA hepcidin expression in two different hepatic cell lines (HepG 2 and Huh- 7) exposed to patients and controls sera to assess whether circulating factors could influence hepcidin transcription in different pathological conditions.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of chronic liver disease patients, {{especially}} those with metabolic syndrome-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis C virus-associated <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> will take statins to prevent cardiovascular disease. As a result, clinicians will weigh complex {{issues raised by the}} interaction of statins with liver metabolism in these disorders. In this article, we critically review data concerning statins and liver pathophysiology with an emphasis on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C virus, while also touching on other chronic liver diseases. Basic research interests include statins' mechanism of action and their effects on cholesterol-related cell signaling pathways and angiogenesis. From the clinical standpoint, many chronic liver diseases increase cardiovascular risk and would undeniably benefit from sustained statin use. The false alarms and security accompanying aminotransferase monitoring, however, are disturbing in light of the scarcity of data on statins' long-term effects on liver histology. Although some actions of statins might eventually prove to be particularly useful in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hepatitis C virus, or hepatocellular carcinoma, others may prove harmful. The lack of definitive data makes a fully informed decision impossible.

40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{hepatitis}} C (HCV) {{infection is}} considered a metabolic disease. It {{is associated with a}} specific metabolic syndrome, HCV-associated <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HCADS), consisting of steatosis, hypocholesterolemia and insulin resistance/diabetes. These metabolic derangements contribute to a decrease in sustained virological response (SVR) to pegylated-interferon-α-ribavirin as standard of care (SOC), and are associated with progression of liver fibrosis. Areas covered: The review, highlighting the impact of HCADS and metabolic syndrome components of HCV disease progression and SOC, discusses current knowledge and perspectives on metabolic therapeutic strategies aimed at improving SVR rate of SOC for chronic hepatitis C. Expert opinion: HCV, features of HCADS and of metabolic syndrome may coexist in the same patient, thus all components of the metabolic syndrome must be assessed to individualize treatment. The results of therapeutic trials evaluating metabolic strategies combined with current SOC indicate that weight loss is a critical part of treatment which will improve both disease outcome and therapeutic response to SOC. Similarly, statins seem to improve response rate to SOC representing, once confirmed to be safe, an important therapeutic tool for HCV-infected patients.

40|$|Insulin resistance, {{defined as}} the {{inability}} of insulin to exert a normal biological action {{at the level of}} its target tissues, is one of the principal pathogenetic defects of type 2 diabetes. Metformin, the most widely-prescribed insulin-sensitizing agent in current clinical use, improves blood glucose control mainly by improving insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production, and by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Experimental studies show that metformin-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity may be associated with several mechanisms, including increased insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, enhanced glycogen synthesis, and an increase in the recruitment and activity of GLUT 4 glucose transporters. In adipose tissue, metformin promotes the re-esterification of free fatty acids and inhibits lipolysis, which may indirectly improve insulin sensitivity through reduced lipotoxicity. The improved glycaemia with metformin is not associated with increased circulating levels of insulin, and the risk of hypoglycaemia with metformin is minimal. The therapeutic profile of metformin supports its use for the control of blood glucose, in diabetic patients and for the prevention of diabetes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, the improvement by metformin of cardiovascular risk factors associated with the <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> may account for the significant improvements in macrovascular outcomes observed in the UK Prospective Diabetes Stud...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of hepcidin, the key iron regulatory hormone, has changed {{our view of}} iron metabolism, {{which in turn is}} long known to be linked with insulin resistant states, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Serum ferritin levels are often elevated in MetS (Dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia - DHF), and are sometimes associated with a true mild-to-moderate hepatic iron overload (<b>dysmetabolic</b> iron overload <b>syndrome</b> - DIOS). However, the pathophysiological link between iron and MetS remains unclear. This study was aimed to investigate, for the first time, the relationship between MetS and hepcidin at population level. We measured serum hepcidin levels by Mass Spectrometry in 1, 391 subjects from the Val Borbera population, and evaluated their relationship with classical MetS features. Hepcidin levels increased significantly and linearly with increasing number of MetS features, paralleling the trend of serum ferritin. In multivariate models adjusted for relevant variables including age, C-Reactive Protein, and the HFE C 282 Y mutation, ferritin was the only significant independent predictor of hepcidin in males, while in females MetS was also independently associated with hepcidin. Overall, these data indicate that the fundamental iron regulatory feedback is preserved in MetS, i. e. that hepcidin tends to progressively increase in response to the increase of iron stores. Due to recently discovered pleiotropic effects of hepcidin, this may worsen insulin resistance and contribute to the cardiovascular complications of MetS...|$|R

The relationship between alcohol intake, incident type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) and CVR describes a J-shaped curve. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and probably nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in particular, is associated with IR, atherogenic dyslipidemia and increased CVR independent of traditional risk factors. Moreover, NASH-cirrhosis and T 2 D contribute to increasing CVR in liver transplant recipients. HBV infection is generally free from IR, steatosis and CVR. HCV-associated <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> featuring steatosis, hypocholesterolemia and IR, appears to be associated with substantially increased CVR. Hyperlipidemia is an almost universal finding in primary biliary cirrhosis, a condition typically spared from steatosis and associated with neither subclinical atherosclerosis nor excess CVR. Finally, little is known on CVR in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: CVR is increased in ALD, NAFLD and chronic HCV infection, all conditions featuring IR and steatosis. Therefore, irrespective of serum lipid phenotype, hepatic steatosis and IR may be major shared determinants in amplifying CVR in common liver disease due to varying etiolog...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To re-evaluate the {{diagnostic}} criteria of insulin resistance hepatic iron overload based on clinical, biochemical and histopathological findings. METHODS: We studied 81 patients with hepatic iron overload not explained by known genetic and acquired causes. The metabolic syndrome (MS) was defined according to ATPIII criteria. Iron overload {{was assessed by}} liver biopsy. Liver histology was evaluated by Ishak’s score and iron accumulation by Deugnier’s score; steatosis was diagnosed when present in ≥ 5 % of hepatocytes. RESULTS: According to transferrin saturation levels, we observed {{significant differences in the}} amount of hepatic iron overload and iron distribution, as well as the number of metabolic abnormalities. Using Receiving Operating Curve analysis, we found that the presence of two components of the MS differentiated two groups with a statistically significant different hepatic iron overload (P < 0. 0001). Patients with ≥ 2 metabolic alterations and steatosis had lower amount of hepatic iron, lower transferrin saturation and higher sinusoidal iron than patients with < 2 MS components and absence of steatosis. CONCLUSION: In our patients, the presence of ≥ 2 alterations of the MS and hepatic steatosis was associated with a moderate form of iron overload with a prevalent sinusoidal distribution and a normal transferrin saturation, suggesting the existence of a peculiar pathogenetic mechanism of iron accumulation. These patients may have the typical <b>dysmetabolic</b> iron overload <b>syndrome.</b> By contrast, patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 60 % had more severe iron overload, few or no metabolic abnormalities and a hemochromatosis-like pattern of iron overload...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} fourth {{case of an}} adult man (29 yr old) {{affected}} by aromatase deficiency resulting from a novel homozygous inactivating mutation of the CYP 19 (P 450 (arom)) gene. At first observation, continuing linear growth, eunuchoid body proportions, diffuse bone pain, and bilateral cryptorchidism were observed. The patient presented also a complex <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> characterized by insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, acanthosis nigricans, liver steatohepatitis, and signs of precocious atherogenesis. The analysis of the effects induced by the successive treatment with high doses of testosterone, alendronate, and estradiol allows further insight into the roles of androgens and estrogens on several metabolic functions. High doses of testosterone treatment resulted in a severe imbalance in the estradiol to testosterone ratio together with the occurrence of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2. Estrogen treatment resulted in an improvement of acanthosis nigricans, insulin resistance, and liver steatohepatitis, coupled with a better glycemic control and the disappearance of two carotid plaques. Furthermore, the study confirms previous data concerning the key role of estrogens on male bone maturation, at least in part, and regulation of gonadotropin secretion. The biopsy of the testis showed a pattern of total germ cell depletion that {{might be due to}} the concomitant presence of bilateral cryptorchidism. Thus, a possible role of estrogen in male reproductive function is suggested but without revealing a direct cause-effect relationship. Data from this case provide new insights into the role of estrogens in glucose, lipid, and liver metabolism in men. This new case of aromatase deficiency confirms previous data on bone maturation and mineralization, and it reveals a high risk for the precocious development of cardiovascular disease in young aromatase-deficient men...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) involves chronic hyperinsulinemia due to systemic and hepatic {{insulin resistance}} (IR), which if uncorrected, will lead to progressive pancreatic beta cell failure in predisposed individuals. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of fatty (simple steatosis and steatohepatitis) and non-fatty liver changes (NASH-cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) that are commonly observed among individuals with multiple metabolic derangements, notably including visceral obesity, IR and T 2 D. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is also often associated with both hepatic steatosis and features of a specific HCV-associated <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In recent years, the key role of the steatotic liver {{in the development of}} IR and T 2 D has been increasingly recognized. Thus, in this comprehensive review we summarize the rapidly expanding body of evidence that links T 2 D with NAFLD and HCV infection. For each of these two liver diseases with systemic manifestations, we discuss the epidemiological burden, the pathophysiologic mechanisms and the clinical implications. To date, substantial evidence suggests that NAFLD and HCV {{play a key role in}} T 2 D development and that the interaction of T 2 D with liver disease may result in a “vicious circle”, eventually leading to an increased risk of all-cause mortality and liver-related and cardiovascular complications. Preliminary evidence also suggests that improvement of NAFLD is associated with a decreased incidence of T 2 D. Similarly, the prevention of T 2 D following HCV eradication in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents is a biologically plausible result. However, additional studies are required for further clarification of mechanisms involved...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of elevated blood pressure in patients with lipodystrophy. Design: Case±control study. Participants: Forty-two patients with abnormal body fat (100 %) and serum lipids (86 %) (HIV-positive cohort) were matched by age and sex to 42 HIV-positive controls without previously diagnosed lipodystrophy and to 13 HIV-negative controls. Setting: Tertiary care, university-based, fully dedicated HIV clinic. Main outcome measures: Frequency and magnitude of elevated blood pressure during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Results: There were 23 16 and 22 12 blood pressure measurements recorded per subject over 21 11 and 22 11 months for the HIV-positive cohort and HIV-positive controls, respectively. Three or more elevated readings occurred in 74 % of the cohort and in 48 % of the HIV-positive controls (P 0. 01) and accounted for 38 25 % versus 22 26 % (P 0. 01) of the total readings, respectively. The average of the three highest systolic readings (153 17 versus 144 15 mmHg; P 0. 01) and diastolic readings (92 10 versus 87 9 mmHg; P 0. 01) was greater for the cohort than for the HIV-positive controls. Family history of hypertension was {{more common in the}} cohort than in the controls but accounted for only 13 % of the log odds ratio value for elevated blood pressure in the cohort. Systolic blood pressure was correlated with waist-to-hip ratios in the cohort (r, 0. 45; P 0. 003) but not in the HIV controls (r, 0. 06; P 0. 68) and tended to be related to fasting triglycerides (r, 0. 34; P 0. 052) in subjects with HIV.

40|$|Insulin resistance, LDL {{particle}} size, and LDL {{susceptibility to}} oxidation in pediatric kidney and liver recipients. BackgroundDyslipidemia is common after solid organ transplantation. We have described hypertriglyceridemia in about 50 % of our pediatric kidney, and in about 30 % of our liver recipients. The {{aim of the}} present study was to find out whether this post-transplantation hypertriglyceridemia after pediatric solid organ transplantation is associated with insulin resistance and the occurrence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). MethodsFifty kidney and 25 liver recipients (aged 4 to 18 years) on triple immunosuppression, and 181 control children participated in the study for an average of 5. 3 and 6. 4 years after kidney and liver transplantation (range 1 to 11 years), respectively. Homeostasis model assessments for insulin resistance (HOMA) were calculated and fasting lipoprotein lipid profile, apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations, LDL particle diameter, and indices of LDL susceptibility to copper-induced oxidation determined. ResultsKidney patients had significantly higher serum total, high-density, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations than liver patients or control subjects (P < 0. 003 for all). HOMA indices higher than the 95 th percentile of Canadian normal children were seen in 50. 0 % of kidney (of liver 41. 2 %) recipients younger than 11 years, and in 27. 3 % of older recipients (of liver 37. 5 %). Smaller sized LDL or LDL of increased oxidizability was not more frequent in patients than in control children. ConclusionPediatric kidney recipients had significantly higher lipid and insulin concentrations than healthy control children. Combined hyperlipidemia and features of the <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> were common in children after kidney and liver transplantation. However, no small, dense LDL, or LDL prone to oxidation was seen in either group...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{past three}} decades have seen liver {{transplantation}} becoming a major therapeutic approach {{in the management of}} end-stage liver diseases. This is due to the dramatic improvement in survival after liver transplantation {{as a consequence of the}} improvement of surgical and anaesthetic techniques, of post-transplant medico-surgical management and of prevention of disease recurrence and other post-transplant complications. Improved use of post-transplant immunosuppression to prevent acute and chronic rejection is a major factor in these improved results. The liver has been shown to be more tolerogenic than other organs, and matching of donor and recipients is mainly limited to ABO blood group compatibility. However, long-term immunosuppression is required to avoid severe acute and chronic rejection and graft loss. With the current immunosuppression protocols, the risk of acute rejection requiring additional therapy is 10 – 40 % and the risk of chronic rejection is below 5 %. However, the development of histological lesions in the graft in long-term survivors suggest atypical forms of graft rejection may develop as a consequence of under-immunosuppression. The backbone of immunosuppression remains calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) mostly in association with steroids in the short-term and mycophenolate mofetil or mTOR inhibitors (everolimus). The occurrence of post-transplant complications related to the immunosuppressive therapy has led to the development of new protocols aimed at protecting renal function and preventing the development of de novo cancer and of <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> However, there is no new class of immunosuppressive drugs in the pipeline able to replace current protocols in the near future. The aim of a full immune tolerance of the graft is rarely achieved since only 20 % of selected patients can be weaned successfully off immunosuppression. In the future, immunosuppression will probably be more case oriented aiming to protect the graft from rejection and at reducing the risk of disease recurrence and complications related to immunosuppressive therapy. Such approaches will include strategies aiming to promote stable long-term immunological tolerance of the liver graft...|$|E

The morbidity, mortality and reduced productivity associated with obesity and its complications result in a major burden to health care costs. Obesity is a complex chronic medical syndrome often with multiple different etiologic factors in individual patients. The long term successful management of obesity remains particularly challenging and invariably requires a multifaceted approach including lifestyle and behavioral modification, increased physical activity, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery remains a last resort though at present it has the best results for achieving sustained robust weight loss. Obesity pharmacotherapy has been very limited in its role for long term obesity management because of the past history of several failed agents as well as the fact that presently available agents are few, and generally utilized as monotherapy. The recent FDA approval of the fixed drug combination of phentermine and extended release topiramate (topiramate-ER) (trade name Qsymia™) marks the first FDA approved combination pharmacotherapeutic agent for obesity since the Phen-Fen combination of the 1990 s. This review details the history and clinical trial basis for the use of both phentermine and topiramate in obesity therapeutics as well as the results of clinical trials of their combination for obesity treatment in humans. The initial clinical approval trials offer evidence that this fixed drug combination offers synergistic potential for effective, robust and sustained weight loss with mean weight loss of at least 10 % of baseline achieved and sustained for up to 2 years in over 50 % of subjects treated. It is anticipated that this agent will be the first in a new trend of multi-agent combination therapy for the chronic adjunctive management of obesity.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} early indicators of the <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (DS) in a population of young survivors with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood. Patients and Methods: We enrolled randomly 80 patients with ALL (50 males) diagnosed between 1991 - 2002. The median age {{at the time of}} study entry was 13. 9 yrs (range, 5. 2 - 24. 1) and the median interval since completion of chemotherapy was 6. 3 yrs (range, 1. 1 - 12. 2). Sixty-two patients (Group A) received chemotherapy only, while 18 patients (Group B) received chemotherapy and cranial irradiation (18 Gy). The investigation included epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, hormonological and imaging data in order to detect early indicators of DS development. Results: An unhealthy diet (74 %; CI 95 %, 63. 1 - 82. 2 %) and absence of regular physical activity (64 %; CI 95 %, 52. 8 - 73. 4 %) were reported, while frank obesity (25 %; CI 95 %, 16. 7 - 35. 6 %), increased blood pressure (21 %; CI 95 %, 13. 6 - 31. 5 %), increased serum triglycerides (21 %; CI 95 %, 13. 6 - 31. 5 %), reduced serum HDL-C (12 %; CI 95 %, 6. 7 - 21. 7 %), increased fasting insulin (8 %; CI 95 %, 3. 2 - 15. 7 %) and osteopenia (71 %; CI 95 %, 60. 5 - 80. 1 %) were detected in the total group of patients. Reduced IGF- 1 (15 %; CI 95 %, 8. 6 - 24. 6 %) and thyroid hormone abnormalities (11 %; CI 95 %, 5. 8 - 20. 2 %) were detected only in Group B. There was a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of obesity (p= 0. 017), high serum triglycerides (p= 0. 023), low serum HDL-C (p= 0. 032), hypertension (p= 0. 022) and DS (p= 0. 028) in all patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of insulin resistance was positively correlated with serum triglycerides (0. 602, p= 0. 01), while it was inversely correlated with serum ΗDL-C (- 0. 473, p= 0. 017). In Group B, there was a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of obesity (p= 0. 024), hyperinsulinemia (p= 0. 004), and the full DS (22 %; CI 95 %, 8. 6 - 45. 9 % vs 8 %; CI 95 %, 3. 1 - 18. 0 %; p= 0. 017) compared to Group A. Conclusions: All the young survivors of childhood ALL, especially those treated with cranial irradiation, are at risk for obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension and the full DS early after the completion of therapy. These biomarkers indicate an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcome, are already present in the young ALL survivors and...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{prevalence}} of obesity in both the developed and developing world have increased, which leads to diverse health outcomes and is placing a heavy burden on the economy. Abdominal obesity proved {{to be one of}} the main features in predicting metabolic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and may be the link that unifies the metabolic syndrome (MS) through pro-inflammatory pathways. While the pathogenesis of the MS and each of its components are complex and not well understood, abdominal obesity remains the mechanism that relates to increased lipolysis causing the liver to increase blood glucose and very low lipoprotein output. This in turns leads to raised blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), blood pressure and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-a) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Prevention of the metabolic syndrome and treatment of its main characteristics are now considered of utmost importance in order to combat the increased CVD risk and all-cause mortality. Decreasing sedentary behaviour through regular physical activity is a key element in successful treatment of obesity through an increase in energy expenditure, but the ability to decrease low-grade systemic inflammation may be an even greater outcome. Aims The aims of this study was firstly, to determine by means of a literature review, how obesity could be related to a state of chronic systemic inflammation (increased CRP and IL- 6). Secondly to determine whether physical activity could serve as a suitable method to decrease inflammation associated with obesity and related disorders. Thirdly to determine if abdominal obesity is a predictor of the metabolic syndrome and CVD and finally, to determine if measures of obesity can predict risk for the metabolic syndrome and CVD risk. Methods For this review study, a computer-assisted literature search were utilized to identify research published between 1990 and 2005. the following databases were utilized for the search: NEXUS, Science Direct, PubMed and Medline. Keywords related to obesity (abdominal obesity, overweight), metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome, <b>dysmetabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> syndrome X), cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease), cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, physical activity), inflammatory markers (CRP, IL- 6, chronic low-grade inflammation) and physical activity (fitness, exercise and training) were included as part of the search, including the references identified by previous reviewers (not identified as part of the computerized literature search). Results and conclusions Several research studies concluded that obesity could be an inflammatory disorder due to low-grade systemic inflammation. Adipose tissue is known to be a sectretory organ producing cytokines, acute phase reactants and other circulating factors. The synthesis of adipose tissue TNF-a could induce the production of IL- 6, CRP and other acute phase reactants. CRP is a acute phase reactant, synthesized primarily in hepatocytes and secreted by the liver in response to a variety of inflammatory cytokines of which IL- 6 and TNF-a are mainly involved. CRP increases rapidly in response to trauma, inflammation and infection. Thus, enhanced levels of CRP can be used as a marker of inflammation. Several studies of large population cohorts provide evidence for an inverse, independent dose-response relation between plasma CRP concentration and level of physical activity in both men and women. Trends for decreased IL- 6, TNF-a and CRP concentrations were linear with increasing amounts of reported exercise in most of the research studies, physical activity proved effective in lowering measures of adiposity (BMI, WHR, WC and percentage body fat) and obesity related inflammatory markers (CRP & IL- 6). Thereby indicating a potential anti-inflammatory effect. In the studies reviewed in this article abdominal obesity is identified as a predictor and independent risk factor for CVD in both men and women. High levels of deep abdominal fat have also been correlated with components of the metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, diabetes, increases in plasma triglyceride levels and a decrease in HDL-C levels (dyslipidemia) in many of the studies. Prospective epidemiological studies have revealed that abdominal obesity (determined by WC and WHR) conveys an independent prediction of CVD risk and is more relevant compared to general obesity (determined by BMI). Abdominal fat has been linked to metabolic risk factors like high systolic blood pressure, atherogenic dyslipidemia, with increased serum TG and decreased HDL-C, and glucose intolerance. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) have been used successfully in many studies to measure adipose compartments of the abdomen (subcutaneous and visceral fat), anthropometrical measures like WHR and WC have been proven to be an effective measure in predicting the metabolic syndrome. WC has also been included in the metabolic syndrome definitions of the WHO, ATP Ill and new IDF.
