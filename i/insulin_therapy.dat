Parents and their child/adolescent were interviewed and completed questionnaires before and approximately three months after starting <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy.</b> Families also recorded their thoughts and feelings about <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> in diaries during the three months. The data were analysed using NVivo software Version 8. Three categories were identified with eleven themes emerging: 'The meaning of diabetes,' encompassed planning and constancy of diabetes care; worries and concerns which included hypoglycaemia, and long term health. 'Transition to insulin pump therapy,' related to 'starting over,' and effort required to manage <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy.</b> 'The meaning of insulin pump therapy,' included fewer needles, freedom, better control of blood glucose levels and being attached, which was related to feeling 'normal'. The findings suggest continuing <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> depends on whether the child/ adolescent feels more or less normal being attached to a machine. The data suggest children/adolescents using the pump find they have more freedom and the pump is easier than using injections to manage their diabetes and they were happier.

Results of three trials comparing <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> with regimens consisting of both rapid acting and long acting analogs are inconsistent, probably indicating the advantage of pump therapy at group level is likely to have become relatively small.

25|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 2 is {{the most}} common form of diabetes. The causes for high blood sugar in this form of diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, with both genetic and environmental factors playing an important role in the development of the disease.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{benefits}} of <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> on the metabolic {{control of both}} type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been reported. Such reports have prompted our interest to investigate the long-term metabolic effects of <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> at our institution. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who began extended <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> at Changhua Christian Hospital between November 2004 and October 2007. One-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis were used to compare baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 C) values with subsequent values. ResultsWe studied 12 patients who were on continuous subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> infusion (CSII) <b>therapy</b> {{at the time of}} data collection. Mean duration of CSII therapy was 2. 3 years. A reduction in HbA 1 C was found after administering CSII, which was sustained after 1, 2 and 3 years of therapy (7. 0 %, 6. 7 % and 6. 6 %, respectively), with statistical significance (p < 0. 05). No incidence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis occurred during the treatment period. ConclusionOur preliminary experience demonstrated the effectiveness of <b>insulin</b> pump <b>therapy</b> for both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. The reduction in their HbA 1 C values was both statistically and clinically significant. This treatment should be considered for patients poorly controlled by subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> injection <b>therapy...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Paradigm system {{consists}} of two basic parts: an insulin pump and an optional glucose sensor CGM worn for up to 3 days. The disposable sensor is subcutaneously-placed to make glucose measurements in interstitial fluid every 5 minutes and transmit the reading via {{low power radio frequency}} (ISM band) to the pump for realtime display. However, <b>insulin</b> <b>therapy</b> may be conducted without CGM and although there is not yet an automated insulin-regulation feedback mechanism between measure and infusion to control the amount and timing of insulin, this is clearly a future objective. So any change in basal or bolus is patient-driven by programming the pump using the Bolus WizardTM. The latest model pumps are the MiniMed Paradigm 522 and 722 which differ in reservoir size, 176 versus 300 units, respectively. In 2007 the FDA approved a pediatric model for patients 7 to 17 years old.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that diabetes {{is caused by the}} absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas. [...] In 1869, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas. [...] In 1921, Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. [...] Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of <b>insulin</b> <b>therapy</b> as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity. [...] The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company's experience with large scale purification of biological materials. [...] Chemist George B. Walden of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced. [...] Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies.

2500|$|It was 1996 {{when three}} Russian {{biomedical}} engineers (Bobylev, Gromova, Toloknov) wrote, [...] "To date, the feedback principle of <b>insulin</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is not fully}} implemented {{because the number of}} monitored physiological parameters is insufficient ... In the early 1960's, Kadish used a system consisting of a glucose sensor, a processor, and a pump to control glycemia in patients with diabetes." [...] Later, this system was developed by Albisser. Today, nearly 50 years after Dr. Arnold Kadish's system, and after advancements as measured by Nobel prizes awarded in medicine, chemistry, and physics, and after more than 23 million people in the United States alone were diagnosed with diabetes in 2007, the industry continues to have the same basic description of a pump system in the marketplace, [...] "a glucose sensor, a processor, and a pump" [...] instead of [...] "sensors, processors, and pumps".|$|E
2500|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and interventive treatment can mean reduced incidence of complications such as cataracts and neuropathy. Since dogs are insulin dependent, oral drugs are not effective for them. They {{must be placed}} on insulin replacement therapy. Approved oral diabetes drugs can be helpful to sufferers of Type 2 diabetes because they work {{in one of three}} ways: by inducing the pancreas to produce more insulin, by allowing the body to more effectively use the insulin it produces, or by slowing the glucose absorption rate from the GI tract. Unapproved so-called [...] "natural" [...] remedies make similar claims for their products. All of this is based on the premise of having an endocrine pancreas with beta cells capable of producing insulin. Those with Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes, have beta cells which are permanently damaged, thus unable to produce insulin. This is the reason nothing other than insulin replacement therapy can be considered real and effective treatment.
