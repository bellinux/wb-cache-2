25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation in 'damages' or money. In {{a limited}} range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to <b>expel</b> <b>a</b> <b>trespasser.</b> This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.|$|E

Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.|$|E
50|$|In {{some regions}} of the world, a {{property}} owner may use reasonable (typically meaning nondeadly) force to prevent a person from trespassing on his, her or its land, or to <b>expel</b> <b>a</b> <b>trespasser.</b> However, a property owner may not force a trespasser off his land if doing so would expose the trespasser to a risk of serious injury. For example, a trespasser who takes shelter in a stranger's barn during a powerful storm cannot be expelled until the storm is over.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amendment}} {{states that}} [...] "the new offence will be committed {{where a person}} is in a residential building as <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> having entered it as <b>a</b> <b>trespasser,</b> knows or ought {{to know that he}} or she is <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> and is living in the building or intends to live there for any period." ...|$|R
50|$|There may be {{regulations}} that hold <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> to <b>a</b> higher duty of care, such as strict liability for timber trespass (removing trees beyond a permitted boundary), which is <b>a</b> type of <b>trespass</b> to chattels {{as a result}} of <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> to land.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{constructive}} <b>trespass</b> {{occurs when}} <b>a</b> {{person who has}} permission {{to be on the}} land overstays their welcome. A person who stays in a business after its closing time, or who goes to a dinner party but refuses to leave long after the other guests have gone home, is <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> despite his initially proper presence. Furthermore, a guest's status as <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> arises as soon as he resists when the property owner tells him to leave the property. This is not <b>a</b> constructive <b>trespass</b> if the guest is unconscious.|$|R

50|$|In {{the law of}} tort, property, and {{criminal}} law <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> is <b>a</b> person who commits the act of <b>trespassing</b> on <b>a</b> property, that is, without {{the permission of the}} owner. Being present on land as <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> thereto creates liability in the trespasser, so long as the trespass is intentional. At the same time, the status of a visitor as <b>a</b> <b>trespasser</b> (as opposed to an invitee or a licensee) defines the legal rights of the visitor if they are injured due to the negligence of the property owner.|$|R

50|$|Blocking {{access to}} someone who has an {{easement}} is <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> upon the easement and creates a cause of action for civil suit. For example, putting up a fence across a long-used public path through private property may be <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> and <b>a</b> court may order the obstacle removed. Turning off the water supply to a downstream neighbor may similarly trespass on the neighbor's water easement.|$|R
500|$|Justice Scalia then {{directed}} the discussion to whether installing {{the device was}} an unreasonable search. Scalia argued that [...] "when that device is installed against {{the will of the}} owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects... against an unreasonable search and seizure." [...] Dreeben argued that it was <b>a</b> <b>trespass,</b> but in United States v. Karo there was also <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> and, according to Dreeben, Karo held that it [...] "made no difference because the purpose of the Fourth Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful interference , not to cover all technical trespasses." ...|$|R

5000|$|Volenti is {{sometimes}} {{described as the}} plaintiff [...] "consenting to run a risk." [...] In this context, volenti can be distinguished from legal consent in that the latter can prevent some torts arising in the first place. For example, consent to a medical procedure prevents the procedure from being <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> to the person, or consenting to a person visiting your land prevents them from being <b>a</b> <b>trespasser.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In sum, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of <b>a</b> claim of <b>trespass</b> to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent to the trespass, 2) interference or intermeddling with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions.

(3) It being {{personal}} property abandoned by its owners, and lying upon the highway, and neither {{the owners of}} the fee nor the proper authorities of the town and borough having by any act of theirs shown any intention to appropriate the same, it became lawful for the plaintiff to gather it up and remove it from the highway, providing he did not commit <b>a</b> <b>trespass,</b> and removed it without objection from {{the owners of the}} land. No trespass was in fact committed. [...] No person was interfered with the plaintiff or made any objection. [...] The court cannot presume <b>a</b> <b>trespass</b> to have been committed.|$|R
