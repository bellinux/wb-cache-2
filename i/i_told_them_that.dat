5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>I</b> had {{the hundred}} {{thousand}} dollars to handle the throwing of the World Series. <b>I</b> also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{the names of the}} men who were going to finance it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> they were waiting below.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{you were}} making up your mind and I came along just then. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you were saved by me. My shout checked you..." [...] She moved her head gently {{from right to left}} in negation.--"No? Well, have it your own way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They were {{speaking}} {{the truth about}} you, and I stopped them. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing wouldn't do. Why, you're getting fat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not tell}} them {{anything}} of the sort. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I accepted their proposal, and that I could answer for your accepting it too." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{went out}} into the front yard I found Mr. Poplington and Jone sitting on a little stone bench, for they was tired, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about <b>that</b> young woman and Davy.|$|R
60|$|HARRIS. There's {{one other}} charge, Mr Mayor--poaching. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to keep <b>that</b> back till after.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have given}} it all up," [...] she whispered, [...] "for you! If <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> the truth, if <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you knew, it would have meant death! You must forget, you must swear to forget." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus far, {{only those}} who were standing, had answered. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> <b>that</b> as they were divided in opinion, they might sit, and I would put the {{question}} to the whole school.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{until after}} breakfast, sir, anyhow. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I might look {{in some time}} in the morning, but that I could not say whether you might want me for anything." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the old Orso {{was brought}} forward {{and taken to}} his palace, and before his eyes it was torn down, stone after stone, till only a heap of ruins marked the site.|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{represents}} one of the first times we tried to emulate The Rolling Stones. In my mind, it was dedicated to the Stones, but <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that.</b> It's one of the rockingest songs I ever wrote." ...|$|R
60|$|The Committee {{are very}} anxious to have you for a steward, {{as one of the}} heads of a large class; and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt you will act. There is no steward's fee or {{collection}} whatever.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, nay. You {{must not}} turn from me too! She laid it all fairly before the lads in Brickwall garden between the yews. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> if Philip sent a fleet (and {{to make a}} {{plantation}} he could not well send less), their poor little cock-boats could not sink it. They answered that, with submission, the fight would be their own concern. She showed <b>'em</b> again <b>that</b> there could be only one end to it--quick death on the sea, or slow death in Philip's prisons. They asked no more than to embrace death for my sake. Many men have prayed to me for life. I've refused 'em, and slept none the worse after; but when my men, my tall, fantastical young men, beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me, it shakes me--ah, it shakes me to the marrow of my old bones.' Her chest sounded like a board as she hit it. 'She showed <b>'em</b> all. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> this {{was no time for}} open war with Spain. If by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against Philip's fleet, Philip would hold me accountable. For England's sake, to save war, I should e'en be forced (<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> so) to give him up their young lives. If they failed, and again by some miracle escaped Philip's hand, and crept back to England with their bare lives, they must lie--oh, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> all--under my sovereign displeasure. She could not know them, see them, nor hear their names, nor stretch out a finger to save them from the gallows, if Philip chose to ask it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wrong," [...] he declared. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that,</b> they'd expect {{something}} from me which I know I shan't get. You are {{right about the}} person, though. I am going to telephone to Brightman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] he said. [...] "They {{did try to}} keep me out, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> my {{business}} was urgent. I have been a journalist, you see, and am used to these little maneuvers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be a fool, Tom,--pray don't. If you won't get up I shall go away. I must go away. I {{have heard}} all {{that there is}} to hear. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> there is no use in your coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My, but I {{did have}} a time of it! I ain't much good at story-tellin' but <b>I</b> reckon <b>I</b> <b>told</b> more stories this arternoon than I ever tole before in all my life. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> they was two of you, an' that the biggest one hed red hair, an' the little one was all pock-marked. Then they said you prob'ly wasn't the man at all, an' my! how they did swear at them two tramps fer gettin' 'em way out here on a wild-goose chase; but they're goin' to look fer you jes' the same in Olathe, only they won't find you there," [...] and she laughed, a bit nervously though.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (her eyes {{falling on}} the {{travelling}} pillow and the pincushion; picking theron: up in turn). <b>I</b> guess you <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that,</b> too.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a wretch," [...] she said, [...] "to {{run away}} and leave me all day long with those horrible people. Well, they will never come here again, for <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if they do the {{servants}} have orders {{to shut the door}} in their faces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{explained}} my {{intentions to}} the men, who both held up their arms in horror. Their fears for my safety {{were a little}} mitigated, however, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> I did not expect them to come with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} just pining without you, Doctor," [...] Captain Doolan said; [...] "and the ladies would have got up a {{deputation}} to meet you on your arrival, only <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be too}} much for your modesty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{about an}} hour ago. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you had telephoned that {{you were on the}} way home, so they said they'd remain out here, {{watching}} for you. I showed them what room they were to occupy," [...] added the lady of the mansion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm no prisoner, Deerslayer, but a free girl, and go {{when and}} where I please. Nobody dare hurt me! If they did, God would be angry, as I can show them in the Bible. No--no--Hetty Hutter is not afraid; she's in good hands. The Hurons are up yonder in the woods, and keep a good watch on us both, I'll answer for it, since all the women and {{children}} are on the look-out. Some are burying the body of the poor girl who was shot, so that the enemy and the wild beasts can't find it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> father and mother lay in the lake, but I wouldn't let them know in what part of it, for Judith and I don't want any of their heathenish company in our burying ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{consulted}} me {{at breakfast}} (they had ordered sweet milk and water, and toast and currant jelly, over night) about the pony, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>that</b> it did unfortunately happen that the pony was half clipped, but that he'd be finished clipping {{in the course}} of the day, and that to-morrow morning at eight o'clock he would be ready. My own opinion is that Mrs. Harry Walmers junior was beginning to give in. She hadn't had her hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't seem quite up to brushing it herself, and it getting into her eyes put her out. But nothing put out Mr. Harry. He sat behind his breakfast cup tearing away at the jelly, as if he'd been his own father.|$|R
60|$|There were no attendants at home; {{they had}} absconded to make merry {{in honor of}} the time. <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not return until the morning, and had given them {{explicit}} orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Further, sir," [...] the man continued, coming {{a little}} closer, [...] "one of them asked me whether the English gentleman--meaning you--was going through to London or not. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{you were getting}} out at the next station and that I {{thought you were going}} to Berlin." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus spoke Bes, {{rolling his}} great eyes and looking so terrible that the herald and the officer fell back {{a step or}} two. Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if my offer did not please them, I myself would fight, first Idernes and then the noble. So they returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{they were}} a mighty hard-looking crowd. They {{came up to the}} claim and wanted to know where he was. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he was gone to Europe and that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good--it was easy to see that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{no doubt}} you {{know all about it}} better than any one else. You usually do." [...] Then five minutes were passed in silence. [...] "Heaven and earth! what shall I do with these people that are coming? And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{especially}} <b>that</b> it was to meet this young man! It's the way I am always treated by everybody that I have about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> them--told <b>them</b> <b>that</b> {{you had to}} go on {{the press}} boat. They said they wished they were going on the press boat too.

5000|$|I {{have heard}} of that idea of Haile Selassie being the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. I also met certain Rastafarians. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> clearly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a man, that I am mortal, and that I would be {{replaced}} by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that the human being is emanated from a deity."
