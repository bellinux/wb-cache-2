2500|$|On 25 January 2011, Aston Martin {{released}} the V8 Vantage S, available in both coupe and Roadster variants, {{and designed to}} produce a more sporty experience than the standard V8 Vantage. The engine is the same 4.7-liter aluminum V-8 found in the base Vantage, but with improved <b>intake</b> <b>airflow,</b> new mufflers, and new programming that keeps the exhaust system’s bypass valves open longer. The net is 430hp and 361lb-ft of torque, gains of 10hp and 15lb-ft. The improvements mean it goes from 0 to 60mph in 4.0 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the base model. Engine output flows through a new single-clutch seven-speed Graziano automated manual to a limited-slip rear differential; the carbon fiber driveshaft spins in an aluminum torque tube. From there, power {{is applied to the}} pavement via a set of(285/35) Bridgestone Potenzas on 19-inch cast aluminum wheels. Bushings, springs, and dampers were stiffened for the S model and the steering rack is quicker than in the base model. The result of all these put together is an exceptional level of response. The aerodynamic enhancements include a deeper front bumper with carbon fibre splitter, larger side sills, a carbon fibre diffuser and a larger tailgate lip designed to sharpen the handling on the road.

50|$|Specific thrust is a {{term used}} in gas turbine {{engineering}} to show the relative bulk of a jet engine (e.g. turbojet, turbofan, etc.) and {{is defined as the}} ratio: net thrust/total <b>intake</b> <b>airflow.</b>|$|E

However, below the shock-on-lip flight Mach number, the shock wave angle/s are less oblique, causing the streamline approaching the lip to be deflected {{by the presence}} of the cone/ramp. Consequently, the intake capture area is less than the intake lip area, which reduces the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow.</b> Depending on the airflow characteristics of the engine, it may be desirable to lower the ramp angle or move the cone rearwards to refocus the shockwaves onto the cowl lip to maximise <b>intake</b> <b>airflow.</b>|$|E

A fan is coupled to the roller bench to provide the vehicle air <b>intakes</b> with an <b>airflow</b> matching the current speed.

50|$|On 14 May 1953, after Joseph Stalin's death, the Sukhoi OKB was reopened {{and by the}} summer, {{it began}} work on a swept-wing front-line fighter.

50|$|The first {{tethered}} {{hover flight}} {{took place on}} 9 January 1963. There were initial problems with hot gas reingestion where hot exhaust gasses are sucked back into the <b>intakes</b> causing poor <b>airflow</b> through the engines and loss of thrust. The suction effect of the exhaust on the ground (which made a higher engine power needed) and problems with control systems caused further difficulties. After modifications, the first untethered vertical flight was made on 23 June 1963, followed by the first full {{transition to horizontal flight}} on 16 September 1963.|$|R

50|$|There {{are other}} {{outdated}} methods of boost control, such as intake restriction or bleed off. For instance, {{it is possible}} to install a large butterfly valve in the <b>intake</b> to restrict <b>airflow</b> as desired boost is approached. It is also possible to actually release large amounts of already compressed air similar to a blowoff valve but on a constant basis to maintain desired boost at the intake manifold. The currently popular exhaust gas bypass via wastegate is quite superior if compared to creating intake restriction or wasting energy by releasing air that has already been compressed. These methods are rarely used in modern system due to the large sacrifices in efficiency, heat, and reliability.|$|R
500|$|The YF-105A {{prototype}} first flew on 22 October 1955, {{with the}} second YF-105A following on 28 January 1956.

[...] (The J75 was expected to generate [...] with afterburner.) [...] Both aircraft featured conventional wing root air intakes and slab-sided fuselages typical of the early jets; Republic viewed the prototypes as not being representative of the true capability of the aircraft due to numerous changes prior to production. Insufficient power and aerodynamic problems with transonic drag, as well as Convair's experience with their F-102, led to a redesign of the fuselage {{to conform to the}} Area rule, giving it a characteristic [...] "wasp waist". In combination with the distinctive forward-swept variable-geometry air <b>intakes</b> which regulated <b>airflow</b> to the engine at supersonic speeds and the J75 engine, this redesign enabled the F-105B to attain Mach 2.15.|$|R

5000|$|The rate of airflow {{through an}} {{internal}} combustion engine {{is an important factor}} determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a throttle that restricts <b>intake</b> <b>airflow,</b> while a diesel engine is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no [...] "throttle" [...] as such.

40|$|Abstract. The {{paper is}} aimed at {{introducing}} our research of mathematical modelling of mine ventilation roadway optimal cross-section and its solving method. As we know, a rational cross-section should be determined to satisfy each <b>intake</b> and return <b>airflow</b> roadway based on {{the analysis of the}} relationship between ventilation cross-section and capital construction costs, in addition to maintenance costs and ventilation power costs. Reasonable selection of ventilation roadway cross-section is important to economic. The least square method is reasonable to build mathematical model for ventilation roadway costs. On the basis of previous studies, the relationship of capital construction costs and maintenance costs were further analyzed. Finally, considering the capital construction, maintenance and ventilation power costs three costs, the mathematical model was more accurate. Through researching a single ventilation roadway costs variation with the size of cross-section, cross-section size determined by considering time variable of costs was optimal, and built by this size could reduce economic investment. Hereby, it provides a solving method for the whole process of ventilation networks roadway cross-section optimization...|$|R

50|$|When the {{accelerator}} is released, the butterfly valve that controls <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> (the throttle valve) is {{closed and the}} air flow through the intake is greatly restricted (but not cut off completely). This causes a high manifold vacuum which the cylinders have to work against - this saps energy and is {{where the majority of}} the engine braking force comes from. The concept can be illustrated by the amount of effort required to blow/suck through a narrow tube vs. a wider one. It is the work the engine has to do against this restricted air flow that provides the braking effect.|$|E
50|$|As flight speed {{builds up}} after take-off, the ram {{rise in the}} intake starts to have a {{significant}} effect upon nozzle pressure/temperature and <b>intake</b> <b>airflow,</b> causing nozzle gross thrust to climb more rapidly. This term now starts to offset the still increasing ram drag, eventually causing net thrust to start to increase. In some engines, the net thrust at say Mach 1.0, sea level can even be slightly greater than the static thrust. Above Mach 1.0, with a subsonic inlet design, shock losses tend to decrease net thrust, however a suitably designed supersonic inlet can give a lower reduction in intake pressure recovery, allowing net thrust to continue to climb in the supersonic regime.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow.</b> A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E
50|$|There {{is still}} some open debate on this issue, but some believe that a problem with short ram air intakes is that the air {{entering}} the intake is at a higher temperature due to {{the proximity of the}} engine, which may reduce some power. This may be partially offset by an increase in the volume of air entering the engine. To counter intake heat problems, many short ram intakes include some form of heat shield. Moving the intake inlet port further away from the engine block will also help to alleviate the problem and some users use a cold air intake where the inlet air is at or close to ambient temperature. However, others claim that Short Ram Intakes (SRIs) or similar Warm Air Intakes (WAIs) offer benefits over Cold Air Intakes (CAIs) which include better MPG due to a more complete burning of fuel. Users with forced induction engines often opt for short ram intakes because compressors adjacent to the engine, especially turbochargers, heat the incoming air and negate much of the benefits of a cold air intake. Additional problems can result from using a short ram intake in cars utilizing a mass airflow sensor though most of today's sensors automatically adjust without issue. Turbulence in the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> produced by the filter or piping, or a change in intake diameter {{at the point where the}} airflow is measured can produce inaccurate airflow readings. The error in airflow then translates to an error in the amount of added fuel. In the worst case, the air/fuel ratio can run lean, causing detonation and possibly engine failure although the airflow sensor will generally detect and correct the throttle to compensate for the warmer air. This can also be solved by modifying/elongating the intake piping, replacing the airflow meter, or by replacing/remapping the engine control computer to provide the correct amount of fuel for the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> at all engine speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{original}} engine series was that the compressor was fairly sensitive to disturbances in the <b>intake</b> <b>airflow.</b> To address this, the HeS 8 added a low-pressure impeller in the intake {{in front of the}} main compressor. The impeller did not add much to the compression, but by increasing pressure on the compressor face the airflow was greatly stabilized. The 14-blade impeller and 19-blade compressor were both made of milled aluminum. The 14-blade turbine was made of steel, and uncooled, which suggests turbine burnout would be common. The various components were connected together on a common tubular power shaft, supported by three ball races. The combustion chamber consisted of two diffusers that slowed the airflow from the compressor, and then injected fuel through 128 nozzles arranged in two sets at different [...] "depths". Various accessories, including the starter, were grouped around the intake and did not add to the overall diameter.|$|E
5000|$|... c) are {{designed}} to have a normal shock in the ducting downstream of intake lip, so that the flow at compressor/fan entry is always subsonic. This intake {{is known as a}} mixed-compression inlet. However, two difficulties arise for these intakes: one occurs during engine throttling while the other occurs when the aircraft speed (or Mach) changes. If the engine is throttled back, there is a reduction in the corrected (or non-dimensional) airflow of the LP compressor/fan, but (at supersonic conditions) the corrected airflow at the intake lip remains constant, because it is determined by the flight Mach number and intake incidence/yaw. This discontinuity is overcome by the normal shock moving to a lower cross-sectional area in the ducting, to decrease the Mach number at entry to the shockwave. This weakens the shockwave, improving the overall intake pressure recovery. So, the absolute airflow stays constant, whilst the corrected airflow at compressor entry falls (because of a higher entry pressure). Excess <b>intake</b> <b>airflow</b> may also be dumped overboard or into the exhaust system, to prevent the conical/oblique shock waves being disturbed by the normal shock being forced too far forward by engine throttling.|$|E
