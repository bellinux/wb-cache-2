2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a forward <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> <b>wheels</b> through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E

50|$|The ATTESA E-TS version uses {{a mostly}} {{conventional}} RWD transmission. <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheels</b> is constant via a tailshaft and rear differential, but <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the front <b>wheels</b> {{is more complex}} by utilizing a transfer case on {{the rear of the}} transmission.|$|R

25|$|Based on the load, gradient, etc., {{the vehicle}} {{requires}} {{a certain amount}} of torque applied <b>to</b> the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> move forward. Since an open differential limits total torque applied <b>to</b> both <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>to</b> the amount used by the lower traction wheel multiplied by 2, when one wheel is on a slippery surface, the total torque applied <b>to</b> the driving <b>wheels</b> may be lower than the minimum torque required for vehicle propulsion.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{condition}} {{required for the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> climb the step was analyzed. As previously described, for the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> climb over the step, the wheelchair has to first perform a wheelie motion, for which the design condition has already been obtained. Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, the drive wheel can also climb the step.|$|R

5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{featured a}} unique wheel arrangement, 1-Do-2 under the UIC classification system, and incorporated a quill <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the driving <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Delta HF 4X4, Lancia {{opted for}} a four-wheel drive system with an in-built torque-splitting action. Three {{differentials}} were used. <b>Drive</b> <b>to</b> the front <b>wheels</b> is linked through a free-floating differential; <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheels</b> is transmitted via a 56/44 front/rear torque-splitting Ferguson viscous-coupling-controlled epicyclic central differential. At the rear wheels is a Torsen (torque sensing) rear differential. It divides the torque between the <b>wheels</b> according <b>to</b> the available grip, with a maximum lockup of 70%.|$|R
50|$|The Hampton 8 was a {{lightweight}} Cyclecar with two-cylinder engine bought in from Precision. The car had belt <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the ear <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

The <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> was by coupling rods from the jackshaft.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Citroën {{launched}} the Méhari 4x4 with <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> all four <b>wheels.</b> Unlike the Citroën 2CV Sahara 4x4, this car {{had only one}} engine, rather than one engine per axle.|$|R

5000|$|The unusual engine layout was the S7's notable feature with {{an engine}} and <b>drive</b> similar <b>to</b> {{that of a}} car. The engine was a {{longitudinally}} mounted inline vertical OHC 500 cc twin with coil ignition and wet sump lubrication which, though a dry clutch, drove a shaft <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel.</b> The inline engine made this technologically feasible (flat-twin [...] "boxer" [...] engines on BMW motorcycles had already used shaft drives). Unlike BMW, who sensibly specified a bevel gear crown-&-pinion <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel,</b> Sunbeam used worm gearing with a bronze spiral gear; by reputation the soft bronze gave rapid wear of drive components.|$|R
50|$|The Aeolus was {{manufactured}} in England by the Bown Manufacturing Company between 1903 and 1905, and featured a 492cc single-cylinder engine with shaft <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel.</b> Production {{was on a}} limited scale.|$|R

50|$|The Abako {{was a small}} 129cc single-cylinder machine built between 1923 and 1925, {{which was}} powered by Abako's own {{two-stroke}} deflector-type three-port engines, two and three-speed Sturmey-Archer gearboxes and chain <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 8 March 1886, {{the inventors}} bought [...] an American model coach built by Wilhelm Wimpff & Sohn, telling the neighbors {{that it was}} a {{birthday}} gift for Mrs. Daimler. Maybach supervised the installation of an enlarged 1.5hp Grandfather Clock engine into the coach, and installed a [...] belt <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wheels.</b> The vehicle reached [...] when tested on the road to Untertürkheim.|$|R
5000|$|In 1916 the 211 cc {{vertical}} {{two-stroke engine}} produced [...] An enclosed chain from the crankshaft drove the Fellows magneto and <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel</b> was by Pedley ‘Vee’ belt. The machine weighed approximately 120 lb.|$|R
50|$|It {{featured}} a rear-mounted air-cooled twin 6/9 hp Coventry-Victor engine with chain <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheels</b> through a three-speed-and-reverse gearbox made by Juckes. To give a conventional appearance the 2-seater car had a dummy radiator at the front.|$|R
25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are wind-powered vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} shroud around them (ducted fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a <b>drive</b> train <b>to</b> <b>wheels</b> or <b>to</b> a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} with airfoils that rotate around a vertical axis.|$|R
50|$|The 350 {{cubic inch}} 5.7-litre 255 {{horsepower}} (L31) V8 {{was the only}} engine offered. RPO ZM9 was standard which included Bilstein 46mm shock absorbers and 3.73 front and rear axle ratios {{as well as a}} locking rear differential. Separate coolers for the transmission and engine oil were also standard. The Denali upgrade also included GM's automatic transfer case which allowed for push button transitions from 2-wheel high to 4-wheel high <b>to</b> 4 <b>wheel</b> low or fully automatic switching from 2 <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> 4 <b>wheel</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Indian 841 was a {{motorcycle}} {{designed by the}} Indian [...] Manufacturing Co. for desert warfare. It pioneered the drivetrain configuration later popularized by Moto Guzzi, having a longitudinally mounted air-cooled 90-degree V-twin with shaft <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... a 16/20 hp four {{cylinder}} model which {{resembled the}} standard Mercedes designs of the period. To wit - the cylinders were cast in two blocks of two cylinders, with side valves, a T-head design and chain <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Projecta was an English {{automobile}} manufactured only in 1914 at the Percival White Engineering Works, Highbury, London. A monocoque-bodied {{two seat}} cyclecar, it was {{powered by a}} vee-twin JAP engine with two speed gearbox and belt <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> the rear <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Skirrow was an English {{automobile}} manufactured between 1936 and 1939. A midget {{racing car}} produced by Harry Skirrow of London, it used a 1000 cc JAP engine and was both unusual and highly noteworthy in having chain <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> all four <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A-body {{designation}} was resurrected in 1964 for a {{new series}} of intermediate-sized cars including the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac Tempest, Oldsmobile Cutlass and Buick Skylark. These later A-bodies underwent a switch in drive layout from rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> in 1982. The switch in drive layout spawned the G-body. In 1997, every A-body car line was cancelled, but new nameplates on the GM W platform have taken their place.|$|R

50|$|It is {{fitted with}} two diesel engines and two transmissions, {{which means that}} it can adjust the {{delivery}} of power according to the tractive effort which needs to be generated. For light loads, one engine {{can be used for}} optimum fuel economy. If the locomotive comes to a steep grade, the second engine can be turned on and the transmission is engaged before losing speed. The locomotive incorporates eight <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> <b>to</b> eliminate <b>wheel</b> slip for most operating conditions.|$|R
