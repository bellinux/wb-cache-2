Within countries high beta stocks outperform low beta stocks only in January, not in other months. We reject the hypothesis that differences in <b>average</b> <b>returns</b> on size- and beta-sorted portfolios can be explained by market risk and exposure to the excess return of small over large stocks (SMB).

Using Manski's (1989) nonparametric no assumptions bounds to partially identify the ability bias for the whole sample, we find that ability bias lies between 9 % and 63 %. This implies an <b>average</b> <b>return</b> to education of between 3. 0 % and 7. 4 % for the whole sample.

40|$|Abstract Water {{resources}} {{design has}} widely used the <b>average</b> <b>return</b> period {{as a concept}} to inform man-agement and communication {{of the risk of}} experiencing an exceedance event within a planning horizon. Even though nonstationarity is often apparent, in practice hydrologic design often mistakenly assumes that the probability of exceedance, p, is constant from year to year which leads to an <b>average</b> <b>return</b> period To equal to 1 /p; this expression is far more complex under nonstationarity. Even for stationary processes, the common application of an <b>average</b> <b>return</b> period is problematic: it does not account for planning horizon, is an average value that may not be representative of the time to the next flood, and is generally not applied in other areas of water planning. We combine existing theoretical and empirical results from the literature to provide the first general, comprehensive description of the probabilistic behavior of the return period and reliability under nonstationarity. We show that under nonstationarity, the underlying distribution of the return period exhibits a more complex shape than the exponential distribution under stationary conditions. Using a nonstationary lognormal model, we document the increased complexity and challenges associated with planning for future flood events over a planning horizon. We compare application of the <b>average</b> <b>return</b> period with the more common concept of reliability and recommend replacing the <b>average</b> <b>return</b> period with reliability as a more practical way to communicate event likelihood in both stationary and non-stationary contexts. 1...|$|R
