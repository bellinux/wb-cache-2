The accumulation uses pre-cooled antiprotons from the Collector Ring (CR) for longitudinal accumulation by the combination of barrier buckets and stochastic cooling. As a benchmarking of computer simulations and for studies of technical requirements for the components employed in this technique a proof of principle experiment in the ESR was proposed.

40|$|Extract] At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, tourists enjoy the privilege of being able to travel to almost any place on the globe, largely free of heavy government restriction, with only a handful of exceptions. As Timothy (1995 b, 2001) observed, there are few borders travellers cannot cross. As a consequence the early 21 st century can be described as a golden age of travel, where borders are not <b>fixed</b> <b>barriers</b> and where those who have the means can travel to almost any corner of the world. There are, of course, exceptions. Citizens of several countries have limited travel rights as a consequence of home government restrictions; other citizens lack the accumulated wealth necessary to finance travel; and there are still some borders that divide belligerent nations...|$|R

The aim of this work consists of the characterisation of this device, which is widely used in industry, but not yet frequently adopted in the field of conservation of works of art.

50|$|The Club {{was formed}} in 1925 as Bramtoco FC from the {{workforce}} of the British American Tobacco Company and {{changed its name to}} BAT Sports in 1971, the same year as they entered the Hampshire League. They progressed through the Leagues, winning Division Two in 1975 and being Champions of Division One in both 1988 and 1989. At that time the installation of floodlights, the construction of a small stand and a permanent <b>fixed</b> <b>barrier</b> enabled them to join the Wessex League. An additional stand and covered standing area followed in due course. Since joining the League they have twice reached the 3rd Round of the FA Vase, on the second occasion being drawn against AFC Wimbledon. With the weather causing the BAT ground to be unfit the tie was switched to South West London drawing an attendance of nearly 3000. Due to the imminent loss of their long serving Southern Gardens home they were forced to drop down a division {{at the end of the}} 2006-07 season and continued with their reserve side in Wessex League Division 2 at the end of that season and because of a restructuring in the leagues and still having their ground with a new one promised by Linden Homes they were put in Division 1 and changed their name to Totton and Eling Football Club. They worked hard in getting a side that would compete and were eventually rewarded in 2009 winning the 1st Division easily with over 100 points and goals regaining Wessex Premier Football again.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we apply the Lie-algebraic {{technique}} for the valuation of moving barrier options with time-dependent parameters. The {{value of the}} underlying asset is assumed to follow the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) process. By exploiting the dynamical symmetry of the pricing partial differential equations, the new approach enables us to derive the analytical kernels of the pricing formulae straightforwardly, and thus provides an efficient way for computing the prices of the moving barrier options. The method is also able to provide tight {{upper and lower bounds}} for the exact prices of CEV <b>barrier</b> options with <b>fixed</b> <b>barriers.</b> In view of the CEV model being empirically considered to be a better candidate in equity option pricing than the traditional Black–Scholes model, our new approach could facilitate more efficient comparative pricing and precise risk management in equity derivatives with barriers by incorporating term-structures of interest rates, volatility and dividend into the CEV option valuation model...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{is a very}} {{important}} relationship between strategic planning and performance management. Performance management is really about setting and achieving goals at the employee level, and identifying and <b>fixing</b> <b>barriers</b> related to achieving those goals. But where do the goals come from? That's where strategic planning comes in. Strategic planning (and also tactical planning), are methods a company, and its individual work-units define their goals and objectives. In turn, those goals and objectives are used to determine and analyze the goals and objectives of each employee in a work unit. This is called cascading of goals. When done properly, setting employee goals should rely on the goals of the particular work-unit, which gets its goals from the planning done by the next bigger work unit, and so on. That's why the setting of individual goals and objectives should be done once the goals and objectives of the work-unit are established. No enterprise will be successful today without a solid, integrated strategic plan driven by a clear vision and supported by a strong performance management system. Key words: strategic planning, organization, performance management...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between designing for both rigid <b>fixed</b> <b>barrier</b> (RFB) and vehicle-to-vehicle tests is a topical area of research. Specifically, vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility {{has been a}} topic of keen interest to many researchers, and the interplay between the two aspects of design is presently addressed. In this paper, the studied vehicles for potential vehicle-to-vehicle impacts included: sport utility vehicles (SUVs), Pickups (PUs), and passenger cars. The SUV/PU-to-Car frontal impact tests were compared to those obtained from vehicle-to-rigid <b>fixed</b> <b>barrier</b> frontal impacts. Acceleration pulses at the B-pillar/rocker as well as dash and cabin intrusions were monitored and compared. Additionally, the energy distributions in SUV/PU-to-Car crash tests were compared to those of single vehicle-to-RFB tests. It was concluded from the analysis that vehicle weight and front-end stiffness were not always the overriding factors dictating performance. Design alternatives that have {{positive impact on the}} distribution of energy on both vehicles involved in a crash were shown to provide improvement in vehicle compatibility. In the present work, it was also shown that good geometrical interaction in SUV/PU-to-Car impact was fundamental in providing self and partner risk-reducing potential. Moreover, the effect of geometry was shown to possibly mask the effects of mass and stiffness. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-country intra-industry trade model with bilateral ad valorem tariffs and fixed export costs that are heterogeneous across firms.

We show that both types of trade barriers reduce (increase) the number of exporting (pure domestic) firms. However, the sum of available home and foreign varieties increases for small tariffs. Firm profits are falling in both tariff and <b>fixed</b> export cost <b>barriers.</b> Tariff revenue falls when fixed export costs increase whereas we have a Laffer curve effect for the tariff. Welfare falls when fixed export costs increase and increases for small tariffs and falls for large tariffs, i. e. there exists a welfare maximizing tariff. ...|$|R
