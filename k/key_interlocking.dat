50|$|To {{help ensure}} safe {{operation}} sequences of switchgear, trapped <b>key</b> <b>interlocking</b> provides predefined scenarios of operation. For example, {{if only one}} of two sources of supply are permitted to be connected at a given time, the interlock scheme may require that the first switch must be opened to release a key that will allow closing the second switch. Complex schemes are possible.|$|E
5000|$|Trapped key {{interlocks}} {{were used}} in the French railway system in the 1890s to control track switching operations. Both the Englishman James Harry Castell (1880-1953) and the American R. L. Kirk [...] developed trapped <b>key</b> <b>interlocking</b> systems, and such systems are often referred to as [...] "Castell" [...] or [...] "Kirk" [...] key interlock systems. Both worked in the power generation and distribution industries {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, and both pioneered the use of trapped key interlock for switchgear control. Trapped key interlocks can be found in many industrial settings including electrical utilities, railway, petroleum, and chemical plants as a response to occupational safety and health legislation.|$|E

50|$|Trapped <b>key</b> <b>interlocking</b> {{utilizes}} {{locks and}} keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or safety key can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or safety key is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|E
40|$|We map a {{discourse}} of the trauma of rape that was widely drawn upon by 29 “lay” New Zealand {{women and men in}} focus group discussions about the impact of rape. Using a discursive approach, we identify the <b>key</b> <b>interlocking</b> elements of this discourse. It centers on the contention that rape is traumatic, and depicts this trauma as unique, severe, long lasting, and in need of healing. We discuss the ways in which this ostensibly more enlightened and sensitive framework of meaning brings forth its own ways of potentially othering, stigmatizing, violating, and obstructing avenues of support and understanding for women who have experienced rape. Keywords discourse, rape, trauma At the beginning of the Western anti-rape movement, feminists were quick to highlight the critical role of “rape myths ” in contributing to what they argued was a rape-supportive culture (e. g., Gavey, 2005). The hypothesized effect of these widely held stereotypical and prejudi-cial beliefs and assumptions was, as Martha Burt (1980) noted, to deny the injurious nature of rape and/or to blame women for their own victimization. They thus provided a powerful interpretive lens for the minimization and justification of rape. Consequently, challenging the assumptions that rape was “no big deal ” for women and that it was a woman’s fault in the first place has been essential in the struggle to overcome cultural tolerance of rape. ...|$|E

Since {{the reliability and}} safety of the scheme critically depends on the possession of keys, duplicate keys must be carefully controlled to prevent any possibility of an unsafe operating sequence.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of interlocking nail repair of a tibiotarsal fracture {{in a black}} swan (Cygnus Cygnus atratus)) is described. A one year old, 3. 70 kg black swan presented with a closed, spiral, midshaft, AO 42 -A 1, Winquist-Hansen type- 0, left tibiotarsal fracture. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a 3. 5 -mm diameter, 113 mm long four-hole interlocking nail. The animal was weightbearing three days postoperatively on the bandaged limb. The fracture was assessed as clinically stable 14 days postoperatively. Twenty weeks postoperatively {{the function of the}} limb was assessed as normal. There seem to be only a few published cases of the presented method. Providing early return of limb function, the interlocking nail was a good method for tibiotarsal fracture repair in this black swan. <b>Key</b> words: <b>interlocking</b> nail, tibiotarsus, black swa...|$|R

I use cross-sectional director interlocks from 2002 to examine the social networks amongst a sample of the largest energy firms, between these firms and the EPPN, and to calculate relative network centrality measures for the firms. I then use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to isolate specific combinations of energy firm attributes that are associated with network position. I find that the energy industry has several <b>key</b> intra-firm <b>interlocks</b> that link dominant companies to each other and that the industry is well represented on the boards of EPPN organizations. Additionally, several dominant energy firms provide links between ultra-conservative and moderate policy development organizations. Finally, QCA models suggest that firms with many employees, high revenue, and who produce oil are most likely to hold prominent positions in the EPPN—though above average political campaign contributions offer an alternative path into the network...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{concerning}} interlocking directorships {{have been}} carried out among Polish joint stock corporations. The main source of data have been the announcements that are to be published by corporations regularly in a journal called Business and Court Gazette (bcg). Interlocking directorships constitute a network among cor-porations the use of which enables co-ordinated management of the whole group. The phenomenon of interlocking directorships in Polish joint stock companies can be compared to the same phe-nomenon existing in other countries. About 13. 43 percent of Pol-ish joint stock company directors possess additional directorships. The average number of directorships for the whole group em-ployed by Polish joint stock companies is 1, 207, and 2, 541 for peo-ple who hold more than one mandate.

50|$|After {{the strap}} is tensioned, the strap is often sealed to itself. Steel strap is sealed with a seal and notch joint, a seal and crimp, seal-less joint, or via welding. Seals come in various shapes {{depending}} on the application; some can be put on after the strap is tensioned, while others must be installed before tensioning. To create the seal, the seal and strap are notched on both sides; if one set of notches are created then it is called a single notch joint, if two sets of notches are created then it is called a double notch joint. Crimp joints also use a seal, but crimp undulations are used instead of formed notches. These crimps form great frictional forces which keep the joint from seeping. Seal-less joints are created by forming <b>interlocking</b> <b>keys</b> {{into the middle of}} the strap.|$|R
40|$|The monetarism, as I {{have tried}} to outline in this work {{is based on the}} ideas of the American {{professor}} Milton Friedman, who tried to revitalize and reconfigure the old quantity theory of money. These ideas were transposed and discussed by authors like Ion Pohoață, Tiberiu Brăilean or Al. Tașnadii and Claudiu Doltu in the works that I have guided the construction of this essay. Thus we observ that one of the basic principles of Friedman’s conceptions was related on budget actions rejection. Actions which in the absence of such money, have little influence on total spending, output and prices, on the significant variables such as macroeconomic. So find a substantive argument in favor of <b>interlocking</b> <b>key</b> economic policies, which can not exist without the other and some which ensures sustainability of state institutions and the economy. ...|$|R

A four point bending test is conducted to all five beam samples to determine the properties of the beams including strength, deflection and strain. From the collected data, the interlocking block beam samples have higher flexural strength reading than the control beam sample except one of them.

Approximately 10 % of 320 first time offenders ordered to the program by Judges in Dallas, Tarrant and Collin County Texas failed to complete the intervention program; 292 (90 %) completed it. The intervention included 4 structured group sessions (total 8 - 10 hrs) and 4 individually focused sessions (approx. 2 hrs). During the individual sessions counselors were to review breath test records and other information germane to behavior change. Pre and post surveys with AUDIT, DRINC and other assessments showed that within the offender groups exposed to the SIP intervention there were changes across all subscales in reported drinking and drinking related consequences (P<. 0001).

40|$|Jüri Kermik {{was among}} 24 {{international}} designers who {{were invited to}} join Finnish furniture designers {{to contribute to the}} EcoDesign 2009 Exhibition in Helsinki. The project which had started in 2008 was coordinated through a staged submission of design statements, sketches and finished designs, culminating in the exhibition which was held in conjunction with the Habitare Furniture Fair, 9 – 14 September 2009. The exhibition, initiated and curated by Professor Yrjö Kukkapuro, showcased nearly 100 proposals for ecological chair designs including new work from Eero Aarnio, Simo Heikkila, Jasper Morrison, Kita Toshiyuki, Zhu Xiaojie, Shigeru Ban and Matteo Thun. Kermik contributed to the exhibition project with the Randwall (eco) Chair which was developed as a continuation of his earlier ‘Encounters’ project. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue featuring chair designs and their EcoAnalysis based on aspects of the design such as foresight, planning and design, materials, production process and the lifecycle of the product. There were more than sixty thousand visitors during the five days and positive feedback was received in international and national media. Randwall Chair is designed in the ‘shared space’ where contemporary industrial, digital and traditional methods co-exist. Developed as part of the ‘Encounters’ project it aims to trace invisible connections between Old and New by intentionally overlapping and cross-referencing methodologies, structural types and techniques which are/were inherent to a specific technological age. The structural type of the Randwall Chair evolved from a speculative attempt to ‘reconstruct’ a regional archetype which never existed. Randwall as a geological and linguistic reference point is used to connect it to the region of Sõrve peninsula, Saaremaa. First development models and prototypes of the Randwall Chair, which explored traditional carpenter techniques, were made from ash and birch sourced and seasoned in Sõrve. The narrative methodology of ‘dismantling’ and ‘reconstructing’ a chair has been used to test ways of engaging with sustainable practice at different levels of design and production. The construction and detailing of the Randwall (eco) Chair supports the idea of inter changeability of materials and production techniques, both Old and New. Regional wood can be used in combination with components cut and formed from industrially manufactured board materials such as plywood, engineered wood and recycled plastics. No glue joints are involved in the process of assembly. Traditional joints are modified to <b>interlock</b> <b>key</b> structural parts and the whole chair is fastened with eight mechanical fixings...|$|R
