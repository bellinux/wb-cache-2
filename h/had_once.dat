5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who <b>had</b> <b>once</b> hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} The Well of Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Bonham's Auction House sold a large {{archive of}} Welles's {{material}} that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> {{belonged to the}} film's executive producer Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Most of the material was from Chimes at Midnight, and included Welles's original artwork, photographs and memos. This collection was later donated to the University of Michigan for scholarly study.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} after Adrienne's death, Lafayette mostly {{remained}} quietly at La Grange as Napoleon's power in Europe waxed, and then waned. Many influential people {{and members of the}} public visited him, especially Americans. He wrote many letters, especially to Jefferson, and exchanged gifts with him, as the Frenchman <b>had</b> <b>once</b> done with Washington.|$|E
5|$|That month, after criticising militants {{at a press}} conference, Yousafzai's father {{received}} a death threat over the radio by a Taliban commander.

5|$|The {{shape of}} the modern, {{sweeping}} version of the madder and white livery was recognisable enough {{to be used with}} different colours; when East Lothian Buses (later Lothian Country Buses) was set up, their fleet used a version in green and beige (the colours of Scottish Midland Buses, which <b>had</b> <b>once</b> run similar routes before being absorbed by First).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{have also been}} put forward to explain the derivation of Bunbury, and Bunburying, which {{are used in the}} play to imply a secretive double life. It may have derived from Henry Shirley Bunbury, a hypochondriacal acquaintance of Wilde's youth. Another suggestion, put forward in 1913 by Aleister Crowley, who knew Wilde, was that Bunbury was a combination word: that Wilde <b>had</b> <b>once</b> taken a train to Banbury, met a schoolboy there, and arranged a second secret meeting with him at Sunbury.|$|E
5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty. Green's defense claimed that {{the fire in the}} family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, who <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church {{rather than as a}} {{religious}} community. The church remained important in part because the parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> belonged to the church.|$|E

5|$|American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux), are {{predominant}} {{in several}} counties and comprise 20 per {{cent of the}} population in West River. The seven large Indian reservations in the state occupy an area much diminished from their former Great Sioux Reservation of West River, which the US government <b>had</b> <b>once</b> allocated to the Sioux tribes. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market <b>had</b> <b>once</b> more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{never married}} {{and he kept}} no account of any romantic relationships, {{although}} his family held that he <b>had</b> <b>once</b> {{been in love with}} Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana.

5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, even if it <b>had</b> <b>once</b> existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya <b>had</b> <b>once</b> stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E
5|$|Hamburg <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been Germany's main seaport, {{the fourth}} largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city {{had been reduced to}} rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E
