40|$|We {{present a}} study on the hydrophobization of spin-on Silicalite- 1 zeolite films through {{silylation}} with trimethylchlorosilane. Microporous and micro-mesoporous Silicalite- 1 films were synthesized by spin coating of suspensions of Silicalite- 1 nanozeolite crystallized for different times. Ellipsometric porosimetry with toluene and water adsorbates reveals that silylation decreases the porosity and makes the films hydrophobic. The decrease in porosity depends on the exposed surface area in the pores. Water contact angle measurements confirm the hydrophobicity. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the trimethylsilyl groups are chemisorbed selectively on isolated silanols and less on geminal and vicinal silanols due to steric limitations.

40|$|Plasma {{treatment}} of polymer films results in their electrical charging, {{which in turn}} gives rise {{to an increase in}} their surface energy. The process results in pronounced hydrophilization of the polymer surfaces. A phenomenological theory relating the change in the apparent contact angle of charged solids to the surface density of the electrical charge is introduced. Partial wetting, inherent for polymer films, becomes possible until the threshold surface density of the electrical charge is gained. The predictions of the theory are illustrated by plasma-treated polymer films and inflatable latex balloons. Deflating the plasma treated latex balloons resulted in an essential increase in the surface charge density of the latex. This increase switched the wetting regime from partial to complete wetting. The kinetics of hydrophobic recovery follows the kinetics of the <b>electrical</b> charge <b>leakage</b> from the surfaces of the plasma treated polymers.
