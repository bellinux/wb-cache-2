40|$|Surface {{water quality}} in the Netherlands {{does not meet the}} {{standards}} for several parameters, e. g. nutrients, metals and pesticides. Although water quality had considerably improved between 1970 and 1995, the last 10 years have seen little change. Point-source pollution had been successfully driven back but non-point sources of pollution could not be tackled under the same policy, or with the same legal and technical instruments. The legal instruments do not fall under the responsibility for water management policy, but rather under agricultural and environmental policy. The various policies are insufficiently attuned to one another to allow the water quality standards to be met. The economy, traffic, level of agricultural production and the population have grown in these 10 years. Thanks to environmental measures, emissions in this period have declined; however, historical pollution still influences present water quality due to large stocks of phosphates, heavy metals and organic pollutants in sediment and soil.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe Upper <b>Rhine</b> Graben has two Plio-Quaternary depocentres usually {{interpreted}} as resulting from tectonic reactivation. The southern basin, near Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), contains up to 250 m of sediments. Beneath the younger alluvial deposits {{related to the}} current drainage system, a former river network deeply entrenched in the substratum reveals a very low regional base level of early Pleistocene age. The offset of channels at faults allows us to infer a Pleistocene reactivation of the syn-rift fault pattern and the estimation of slip rates. Maximum vertical movements along the faults have not exceeded 0. 1 mm/yr since the middle Pleistocene. Current activity is concentrated along the westernmost faults. Morphologic markers indicate late Pleistocene reactivation of the Rhine River fault, and geophysical prospecting suggests a near-surface offset of young sedimentary deposits. The size of the fault segments potentially reactivated suggests that earthquakes with magnitude larger than Mw ¼ 6 : 3 could be expected in the area with a return interval of about 8000 years. Extrapolated to {{the duration of the}} Plio-Pleistocene, the strain rate estimates reveal that the tectonic forcing may account for only one-third to one-half of the whole thickness of the Plio-Pleistocene sediments of the basin fill. Thus other processes must be invoked to understand the growth of the Plio-Pleistocene basin. Especially the piracy of the Rhine River to the north during the early Pleistocene could explain these effects...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe Upper <b>Rhine</b> {{alluvial}} aquifer is {{an important}} transboundary water resource. However, as in many alluvial systems, the aquifer inflows and outflows are not precisely known {{because of the difficulty}} of estimating the river infiltration flux and the boundary subsurface flow. To provide a thorough representation of the aquifer system, a coupled surface-subsurface model was applied to the whole aquifer basin, and several parameter sets were tested to investigate the uncertainty due to poorly known parameters (e. g. aquifer transmissivity computed by an inverse model, river bed characteristics). Twelve simulations were run and analyzed using standard statistical criteria and also a more advanced statistical method, the Karhunen Loève transform (KLT). This analysis showed that, although the model performed reasonably well, some piezometric level underestimations persisted in the south of the basin. An accurate representation of the aquifer behaviour would require river infiltration and the functioning of irrigation canals in the Hardt area to be taken into account. It also appeared that increasing the maximum river infiltration flow deteriorated the quality of the results. River infiltration to the aquifer was estimated to represent about 80 % of the aquifer inflows with a mean annual value around 115 ± 16. 5 m 3 /s, thus with an uncertainty of 14 %. This quantity is larger than estimated in previous studies but is in agreement with some results obtained during low water periods. This important conclusion highlights the vulnerability of the Upper Rhine Graben aquifer to pollution from the rivers and to climate change since it is highly probable that the rivers' regimes will be affected by reduced snow cover on the neighbouring mountain ranges...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe Upper <b>Rhine</b> hydrosystem {{exhibits}} a high biodiversity. Since mid- 19 th century, several engineering projects developed for flood control, agriculture, navigation and hydropower, have drastically impacted aquatic and riparian habitats. In this context, the specific alluvial {{species of the}} Rohrschollen natural reserve is declining. Its main watercourse, the Bauerngrundwasser, an anastomosing channel of the Rhine, has now a constant and low discharge (under 0. 1 m 3 /s), inducing {{a high rate of}} fine sediment deposition. During periods of high flow, the site is flooded but water has no energy due to a dam's backwater effect. The LIFE+ project "Restauration de la dynamique des habitats alluviaux rhénans sur l'île du Rohrschollen", managed by the City of Strasbourg, plans to restore the hydromorphological and ecological functionality of the hydrosystem: bedload dynamics, channel mobility, surface water-groundwater exchanges, renewal of pioneer ecosystems [...] . Thus, the Bauerngrundwasser will be reconnected to the Rhine by building a new upstream connection channel. Water input will attain 80 m 3 /s, leading to dynamic floods and making of this project one of the most ambitious for the French side. To assess the efficiency of this restoration project, a hydromorphological monitoring (included in an inter-disciplinary project) is carried out and is based on the comparison of pre- and post-restoration dynamics.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>Rhine</b> Graben {{is a major}} site of {{development}} for the geothermal heating production in France. Targeted geothermal reservoirs are in deep Hercynian granitic basement which is fractured dominated system, and more recently at the cover/basement interface. In this framework of geothermal exploration, {{a better understanding of}} the hydraulic behaviour of the fracture network and fluid/rock interactions is needed. For that fracture fillings inHercynian granitic basement and in the formations of the cover (Permian rhyolites, Permian and Triassic sediments) were studied for mineralogy, fluid inclusion microthermometry and (C, O, Sr) isotopes in order to trace paleocirculations at the cover/granite interface in the Rhine Graben. Data were acquired on fracture fillings in samples of the basement/cover interfaces from the EPS 1 borehole at Soultz-sous-Forêtin the Rhine grabenat ~ 1417 meters depth, and from outcrops in quarries on the flanks of the graben (Waldhambach, Saint Pierre Bois, Windstein, Heidelberg [...] .). Mineral sequences of polyphasedfillings were interpreted in relation with the geological contextincludinglate evolution of the Hercynian basement and major extensive tectonic events. Quartz, carbonates, sulfates and illiteare major minerals identified in fractures crosscutting Hercynian granites, Permian rhyolite (Waldhambach) and Permian and Triassic sedimentary cover. Although quartz being considered as a major mineral filling fractures, petrological observations showed that carbonates are also an important and probably underestimated phase of filling, and of interest for two reasons. Firstly, from a geothermal point of view, they contribute to the clogging of fractures. Secondly, from a scientific point of view, they are informative on the variations of fluid chemistry through geological times. Among carbonates, dominant dolomite with minor ankerite, Mn-bearing carbonates and siderite was identified by CL, SEM and EPMA in fractures. A same generation of dolomite was identified in fractures crosscutting Hercynian granite and in Permian and Triassic sandstones of the Rhine Graben (EPS 1 borehole) but also on the flank of the Rhine Graben in Hercynian granite of Waldhambach, Heidelberg and Windstein quarries, and in Permian rhyolite at Waldhambach. This dolomite is Fe and Mn poor, formed at ~ 120 - 130 °C, and has a 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of ~ 0. 708 - 0. 709. Barite is the major sulphate observed in fracture filling, already formed later than dolomite. Rare microthermometric data combined with strontium isotopes provide evidence of several generations of barite with one generation formed at ~ 130 °C. Preliminary data on dolomite provide evidence of large fluid circulations at the cover/granite interface. This dolomite is observed at least at depth down to 1650 m of the granite in the EPS 1 borehole, i. e. with a minimum penetration of 200 m into the granite. Alternating deposition of ankerite and dolomite in fracture corridors strongly suggest pulses of fluids. Such fracture fillings at 1641 meters depth were attributed to present-day fluid circulations. However similar generation of dolomite also observed in fracture corridorcrosscutting the Hercyniangranite and Permian rhyolite at Waldhambachon the flank of the Rhine graben demonstrate that the fluid circulation...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe Old <b>Rhine</b> {{downstream}} of the Kembs {{diversion dam}} {{is one of}} the largest by-passed river reaches in the world (50 km). It offers a unique opportunity to study the morphological effects of by-passing and address physical and ecological restoration approaches in regulated rivers. We conduct a space-time analysis of channel adjustment over a period of 80 years (1932 to 2011). We examine planform changes (from aerial photographs), erosional and depositional patterns (from vertical profiles), sediment sizes within the active channel and the new established floodplain, and we date riparian vegetation encroachment. Results show that the Old Rhine exhibited rapid response to the completion of the by-passing scheme in the 1950 s, with a 26 % narrowing in median active channel width between 1956 and 2008, from vegetation encroachment on dewatered channel margins (mostly groyne fields). The narrowing was accompanied by overbank fine sediment deposition (similar to 1. 5 cm y(- 1) aggradation since 1950) as well as slight bed degradation (similar to 0. 7 cm y(- 1) since 1950). We found no downstream propagation of active channel narrowing over time, nor propagation of bed degradation. The channel was already significantly adjusted prior to the diversion scheme, following the nineteenth century river straightening and groyne construction. By-passing (dewatering) mainly provided new pioneer habitat for synchronous vegetation establishment and promoted channel stability by decreasing sediment transport owing to peak flow reduction. The morphological budget calculated over the past 20 years estimated a downstream output for coarse sediments at 16, 000 m(3) y(- 1), with 80 % originating from bed degradation and 20 % from bank erosion, without significant inputs from upstream. The present-day morphodynamics remain sensitive to changes because of dynamic bed armouring (< 2. 1). This retrospective analysis permits us to discuss management strategies for altered rivers. Recommended activities are gravel reintroduction with particle-sizes finer than the armoured river bed to enhance sediment transport and promote form dynamism under current flood magnitudes. This should be coupled with river widening to allow for complex depositional patterns that benefit ecological habitats. These actions should not be implemented without prior analysis of local sediment transfer processes based on in situ experiments and modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The waterflea Daphnia magna is {{a widely}} used test {{organism}} in ecotoxicological studies. Acute and chronic laboratory tests yield basic information {{for the development of}} water quality standards, assessment of potential hazards of (new) chemicals, waste water licences and sanitation measures for contaminated sediments. Environmental risk assessment also includes extrapolation from laboratory to field, for which theoretical models are applied. Reliable results can only be obtained if:toxicity test results are both accurate and reproducible, andextrapolation models take account of major ecological processes. It has been recognized that under current international guidelines for Daphnia toxicity tests interlaboratory variation of test results is disappointingly large (Cowgill, 1987; Baird et al., 1989 a). Differences in test conditions and culture techniques are regarded as a main source of variation, but their relative contributions are largely unknown. The distance between a single-species test under laboratory conditions and the response of an aquatic ecosystem is enormous, in terms of complexity. A first step has been made by Kooijman, who developed a model to predict effects of toxicants on Daphnia populations from effects on individuals (Kooijman, 1986; Kooijman et al., 1989). From comparisons between experimental and simulated population dynamics research questions regarding critical model assumptions were derived. The present study focuses on food availability, which plays {{a central role in the}} life history of D. magna. Its development and reproduction are dependent on food level, as well as its sensitivity to toxic stress. The importance of food for the culture of test animals was investigated, as a contribution to standardisation of toxicity tests. Besides, assumed relationships between food level and Daphnia growth and reproduction are validated, in order to support development of extrapolation models. The experimental approach has been chosen to address the research questions related to both toxicity testing and extrapolation models. New techniques were developed for that purpose. Cadmium, chromium and lead, which are designated as priority pollutants by the <b>International</b> <b>Rhine</b> Committee (1987), have been applied as model substances. The investigations have been carried out at the Instute for Inland Water Management an Waste Water Treatment in Lelystad. New experimental methodsLength measurements are basic to fife history research. Therefore, electronic sizing of living D. magna was pursued by development of a computer program, which was based on an existing image processing system. This method, which is described in chapter 2 , was much more rapid than manual measurements with a microscope, although it was less precise. Image analysis is recommended for determination of large samples, e. g. length frequency distributions of populations. Debris in the size range of the objects has to be removed. When it comes to precision, for instance determination of growth curves, the manual method should be used. Competition mechanisms within a Daphnia population were investigated with a newly developed culture system (chapter 6 ). it consisted of two interconnected culture vessels, each holding a cohort. An air-driven flow of medium plus algae circulated between these vessels, hence allowing the cohorts to share the same food conditions. The system proved to be a useful tool for competition studies. It enables detailed studies of the exploitation of a common food source by competitors that are similar in morphology, or should be kept apart for other reasons. Different, externally driven food dynamics can be simulated. With a few adaptations the system can easily be extended to hold three or more competing groups. StandardizationCurrent international guidelines predominantly aim at standardisation of conditions during toxicity tests. Therefore, culture methods, i. e. pre-test conditions, differ among research laboratories. As an example, methods practised at the Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment (RIZA) are described in chapter 2 . The experiments in the present study were conducted with D. magna cultered in natural water from Lake Ijssel. The green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa was used to feed the Daphnia. Transfer cultures were supplied with constant daily food rations, and young were removed three times a week. Hence, the density of algae varies with cumulative filtration rates of the mother cohort and the progeny which has not yet been removed. This may carry over into the results of ecotoxicological studies, as maternal feeding conditions can affect the quality of the young. Cowgill et al. (1985) showed an inverse relationship between brood size and weight of newborn D. magna in a laboratory population. They suggested the existence of a reproductive strategy, which earlier had been proposed by Hutchinson (1951) on the basis of field observations. According to this strategy females spread their genes around under favourable conditions by producing many small, 'cheap' neonates, while heavy, stress-resistent young are born when food is sparse. An important objective of the present thesis was to test the validity of this strategy and to explore ecotoxicological and ecological consequences by experimentation (chapters 3 and 4 ). It could be demonstrated in our studies that reproduction of females, which were exposed to an abrupt increase or decrease of food ration between the third and the fourth brood, was fully adapted to the new situation in three instars, or c. eight days at 20 °C (standard laboratory temperature). Brood sizes ranged from 7 to 76 and neonate carapace lengths from 1. 1 to 0. 92 mm. The smallest young (0. 80 mm) were observed in the first brood. The latter is a well-known phenomenon that is accounted for in toxicity test guidelines (e. g. OECD, 1984) by discouraging the use of the first brood. The main reason for this advice is reduced survival in controls, which may invalidate the test (e. g. Cowgill et al., 1986). The present study shows that large neonates contained more lipid reserves than small ones. Therefore we may expect a positive correlation between survival at starvation and body size. This was confirmed in the starvation experiments described in chapter 5 and Enserink (1989), but not in similar experiments in chapter 4 . In connection with unfed 48 h toxicity tests it is worth noting that median survival times never fen below 4 d, even for the smallest (0. 77 mm) neonates. An even more important reason to pay attention to neonate size is that small neonates can be more sensitive to toxicants than large young in acute (48 h) tests (chapter 3 ). When exposed to cadmium there was a threefold difference between the LC 50 's for small and large animals. However, no such effect was found in toxicity tests with chromium(VI), i. e. LC 50 's were similar in all tests, which probably relates to different modes of action of these two metals. In chronic (21 d) toxicity tests the initial size of test animals appeared to be less important (chapter 4 ). Whereas the trends observed in acute tests were consistent in several trials (e. g. Enserink, 1989), this was not the case in chronic tests. The results suggest that environmental conditions during the test mask subtle differences in neonate size and lipid reserves. The variation in effect concentrations caused by non-simultaneous replication was in the same order of magnitude, i. e. a factor of 2, as the effects of initial body size. Probably, food supply during these tests was inadequately controlled. The most conspicuous conclusion of the present studies is that maternal food ration is of paramount importance to neonate fitness and hence to the results of acute toxicity tests, at least for some chemicals (Enserink, 1989; Enserink et al., 1990). Similar results were obtained independently by Baird et al. (1989 b). More recently, a number of other investigators have confirmed these findings. The reproductive strategy in D. magna was also observed by Cox et al. (1992), Naylor et al. (1992) and Viganò (1993). According to Naylor et al. (1992) the inverse relationship between maternal food level and neonate size also holds for dry weight, although this parameter appeared to be more variable than body length. Even under normal culture conditions, when food level is not purposely varied, brood to brood oscillations of neonate weight and length were inversely related to oscillations of mean clutch size (Viganò, 1993; Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Such variation can be caused by unstable quality or quantity of food supply, increased grazing capacity owing to body growth and periodic presence of neonates. The results of the current studies suggest that the influence of maternal food conditions on the results of acute (48 h) toxicity tests depends on test substance. Cadmium toxicity was modified by neonate size, but the toxicity of chromium remained unaffected. The largest influence was reported for 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, i. e. a factor of 6 (Baird et al., 1991). A significant positive correlation between neonate size and LC 50 was found for sodium bromide and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (Naylor et al., 1992), and copper (Lazorchak & Waller, 1993). Viganò (1993) found no effect of neonate size on LC 50 's for ethylbenzene and n -butylbenzene, but the variation of test results was very limited, as was the size range of the test animals. For cadmium however, the effect of maternal ration was confirmed (Baird et al., 1991), but neonate length showed no correlation with LC 50 in the experiments of Naylor et al. (1992), which is inconsistent with the results of the present studies. Several differences between our study and that of Naylor et al. (1992) might account for these results, e. g. the presence of food during the test, the use of another clone and a different test medium. It is of interest to note that both studies were carried out|$|R
