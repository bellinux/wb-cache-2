40|$|Planners and {{decision}} makers are challenged to consider not only direct market costs, but also <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities.</b> There {{is an increasing}} emphasis on ecosystem services {{in the context of}} human well-being, and therefore the valuation and accounting of ecosystem services is becoming an integral component of economic efficiency (Costanza 2003, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Depending on the type of decision to be made, associated ecosystem services may be quantified by using a variety of approaches that could consider deterministic physical and chemical processes, known empirical relationships, and/or socioeconomic valuation methods. There are existing lists and directories that emphasize process modeling to evaluate results of water resources decisions, changes in mass and energy budgets, and other direct physical manipulations. These can be found on several governmental and non-governmental websites. In the context of decisions that affect ecosystem services in the more general sense, <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities</b> may be quantified using process models, but there may be tools and techniques that consider broader measures. The Ecosystem-Based Management Tools Network (NatureServe 2008) has developed a database of tools that consider bundled ecosystem services emphasizing coastal and marine systems. The database presented herein augments the scope of ecosystem services in the broad sense of decision support related to the USEPA’s Ecosystem Services Research Program (USEPA 2009). The purpose is to provide an evolving searchable database of tools, approaches, and techniques that can be applied in analytic-deliberative decision support processes accounting for improving decisions that may affect ecosystem services...|$|E
40|$|Market-based {{approaches}} to environmental management, such as payment for environmental services (PES), have attracted unprecedented attention {{during the past}} decade. PES policies, in particular, have emerged to realign private and social benefits such as internalizing <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities</b> and diversifying sources of conservation funding as well as making conservation an attractive land-use paradigm. In this paper, we review several case studies from Asia on payment for environmental services to understand how landowners decide to participate in PES schemes. The analysis demonstrates the significance of four major elements facilitating the adoption and implementation of PES schemes: property rights and tenure security, transaction costs, household and community characteristics, communications, {{and the availability of}} PES-related information. PES schemes should target win-win options through intervention in these areas, aimed at maintaining the provision of ecological services and improving the conditions for local inhabitants...|$|E

The real option approach takes into account this irreversibility and changes established conclusions for the reversible investment case. Under irreversibility, eminent domain efficiency is more sensitive to compensation rules than previously thought. Setting compensation equal to what market value {{would be in the}} absence of eminent domain [...] the approach taken in the US and many other countries [...] reduces efficiency relative to losing the <b>ecological</b> <b>externality</b> to private development. Compensating at the market value under eminent domain threat increases efficiency, {{but not as much as}} compensation at social value does. Eminent domain Compensation Green space Land value...|$|R
40|$|Production and {{consumption}} of fossil fuels {{is one of the}} major causes of the green house effect, which is in economics known as a form of <b>ecological</b> <b>externality.</b> Fiscal solution, as one way of internalization of externalities, is based on polluters-pay principle and the imposition of tax on emission. Although the implementation of ecological tax was intensified during the previous decade, fiscal revenues are modest and account for only 5 % of the total fiscal revenues of the European Union. Taxes on energetic products, accounting for 76 %, are dominant among ecological taxes. Since the EU Directive 82 / 92 imposes minimum excise rates on oil products, during the last decade Central Eastern European countries have increased excise rates on fossil fuels and fully engaged in the field of ecological policy...|$|R

Measuring broader, long-term effects of vaccination on productivity and externalities could provide a more complete picture {{of the value of}} vaccines. Method MEDLINE, EconLit and NHS-EED databases were searched for articles published between January 1990 and July 2011, which captured broader economic benefits of vaccines in low and middle income countries. Studies were included if they captured {{at least one of the}} following categories on broader economic impact: outcome-related productivity gains, behaviour-related productivity gains, <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities,</b> equity gains, financial sustainability gains or macroeconomic benefits. Results Twenty-six relevant studies were found, including observational studies, economic models and contingent valuation studies. Of the identified broader impacts, outcome-related productivity gains and <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities</b> were most commonly accounted for. No studies captured behaviour-related productivity gains or macroeconomic effects. There was some evidence to show that vaccinated children 8 – 14 years of age benefit from increased cognitive ability. Productivity loss due to morbidity and mortality was generally measured using the human capital approach. When included, herd immunity effects were functions of coverage rates or based on reduction in disease outcomes. External effects of vaccines were observed in terms of equitable health outcomes and contribution towards synergistic and financially sustainable healthcare programs. Conclusion Despite substantial variation in the methods of measurement and outcomes used, the inclusion of broader economic impact was found to improve the attractiveness of vaccination. Further research is needed on how different tools and techniques can be used in combination to capture the broader impact of vaccination in a way that is consistent with other health economic evaluations. In addition, more country level evidence is needed from low and middle income countries to justify future investments in vaccines and immunization programs. Finally, the proposed broader economic impact framework may contribute towards better communication of the economic arguments surrounding vaccine uptake, leading to investments in immunization by stakeholders outside of the traditional health care sector such as ministries of finance and national treasuries. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{household}} {{survey on}} the financial drivers of woodlot production was conducted in the Lake Tana watershed of Amhara State, Ethiopia. Analysis of smallholder Eucalyptus globulus Labill. production reveals that converting uneroded over eroded croplands leads to significantly higher financial returns. Returns were also significantly higher for rotation intervals closer to the optimal economic rotation and for higher planting densities. Most woodlots had positive financial returns. The presence of negative financial returns for some households demonstrates that positive <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities,</b> a lack of economies of scale and/or myopic behavior are potentially important factors in land use decision-making. Wood utilization decisions were shown to impact the potential financial returns of households. Smallholders’ activities demonstrate that eucalyptus is an imperfect substitute for agricultural production on surplus cropland. A third of respondents indicated they had intentionally chosen to convert uneroded croplands to achieve higher returns. Smallholders faced constraints in bargaining over price and access to markets. Future land use policies should address marketing constraints and unsustainable land use activities. Harvesting soil from natural forests and the conversion of productive surplus cropland to woodlot production both present long-term sustainability challenges. This study demonstrates the importance of considering economic and social incentives when creating land use policies for smallholder's woodlot production...|$|E
40|$|The {{capitalist}} world-economy {{takes the}} form of an iceberg. The most studied part which appears above the surface is supported by a huge underlying structure that is out of sight. Unlike the iceberg, the world-economy is a dynamic system based on flows of value from the underside toward the top. These include drains of surplus (expropriated value) that take two forms: visible monetarized flows of bright value and hidden un(der) costed flows that carry dark value (the unrecorded value of cheap labor, labor reproduction and <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities).</b> Commodity chains are central mechanisms for these surplus drains in the world-economy. At each node of the chain, participants attempt to maximize their capture of bright value through wages, rent and profit. They do this by constructing differential degrees of monopoly (control of the markup between cost and sale price) and degrees of monopsony (control of markdowns of production costs). However, this process depends upon the transformation of dark value into bright value for capture. Via an examination of the Apple iPad commodity chain, I show how the bright value captured by Apple depends on the dark value extracted by its suppliers. Dark value is estimated by measurements of the value of under-payments for wage labor, reproductive labor and environmental damage in Asian countries, especially China. Surprisingly, most dark value embedded in the iPad is captured by final buyers (mostly in the core) as consumer surplus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{focuses on}} {{environmental}} policies aimed at rising investment in pollution abatement capital. We assume that ecological uncertainty, i. e., uncertainty over {{the dynamics of}} pollution, affects firm investment decisions. Capital irreversibility is not postulated but endogenized using a quadratic adjustment cost function. Using this framework, we {{study the effects of}} environmental policies considering taxes on polluting inputs and subsidies to reduce the cost of abatement capital. Environmental policies promoted to enforce abatement capital may generate the unexpected result of reducing the abatement investment rate.

The transformation of activities, the arrival of new technologies, the arrival of organizations with large financial and technological capabilities, the displacement {{of hundreds of thousands}} of small-scale and medium-scale farmers and their reallocation to new productive functions are not only affecting the social sustainability of the rural sector but are affecting the urban communal plots of villages and towns located on the Chacopampeana Plain. Now, the production of agrofuels as a response to international global demand will promote the ecological and social depletion that Argentina has been facing from the beginning of the 1990 s. We argue in terms of <b>ecological</b> economics that <b>externalities</b> should be included in the costs of companies, not just economic costs...|$|R

During the last past decades we were the witnesses of the man`s slow growing interest in questions of environment. In the both national and international level there were established the policies, which goal is to solve the environment related problems and give an environment the protection. Within the politics there were established and there are used the assorted instruments. From the early beginning there were commands and restrictions mainly, nowadays there are another instruments starting to be used too, and above all the economic instruments. To the economic instruments the environmental taxes are counted too. To the {{better understanding of the}} problem is this thesis at the environmental taxes questions exlamation builded on the total bases. In the chapter two there are as the first brought to light the basic terms, on which the whole environmental taxes problems are in the most of cases builded, and the short history of "environmental thinking" with the description of the evolution in the attitude of the European Union and especially the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{planning}} horizons {{serves as a}} measure of many unsettled aspects of economic analysis. First and foremost, the notion is ordinal: we speak of ‘horizon effects’ as directional shifts in planning horizons without tallying ‘wits’ or calibrating horizonal axes of change. Second, the derivation of horizon effects is inductive; we simply assert their inherence in the range of factors subsumed within the imagined projections behind all choice. The planning horizon is set wherever surprise supplants expectation; the horizon occurs at the outer range of accurate anticipation, to which we lack clear epistemological access. Planning horizons – horizon effects – suggest a new foundation for an ethical economics of conscience, social maturation and growth. The idea of planning horizons invites a distinction of foresight from myopia in economic constructions. But time horizons are only one aspect of our planning horizons: to see ahead in time we must embrace all relevant causal effects. Foresight depends on knowledge of how reality actually works, which is a matter more of degree than ‘truth’; the planning horizon offers an index of our ‘rational bounds. ’ Our range of anticipation is also related to our internalization of social and <b>ecological</b> <b>externalities</b> in our decisions, so to the scope of our ethical conscience and to our sense of human community. Indeed, the organizational health and integrity of our society is horizonal in this sense. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore and develop the concept of planning horizons in its intellectual origins and economic concerns. Its philosophic conceptual roots, methodological underpinnings, psychological insights and economic implications are outlined to show why an economics of planning horizons offers an ethical economics of interdependent dynamic complex systems. With standard doctrines seen as a special case in a larger horizonal frame, social theory embraces an ethical economics with dissimilar institutional implications favoring cooperation...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{in support of}} the {{development}} of an ecological economic framework. It discusses, from an interdisciplinary perspective, the increasing use of green IT and their applications (IT for green). IT and sustainable development have had a concomitant rise and reach. The future world emerging from their respective interpretations enables, in both cases, a shift from today's questionable industrial capitalism towards post-industrial capitalism. This paper addresses the following questions: What is known about green IT and IT for green? Are smart solutions (buildings, energy grids, transport) always beneficial to an ecological economy? And, if so, in what ways? In {{the first part of this}} article, we analyse the economic, social and environmental impact of IT and argue for the need for green applications of green IT in order to achieve sustainable outcomes. The second part focuses on the managerial dimension of eco-innovation theory and presents one of the distinctive features of green applications of green IT: the collective organisation of innovation. A typology of eco-innovation aimed at reconciling IT development and green growth is then proposed explicitly addressing four kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social, institutional and organisational innovation.
