40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy {{launched}} the 5 th Solar-Decathlon-competition, defying student teams {{from all over}} the world to conceive a house powered exclusively by the sun. Team Belgium, of Ghent University, conceived the E-Cube, a modular and <b>flexible</b> <b>house,</b> that could be adapted depending on the inhabitants, the building site and the climate. This paper focuses on that last aspect: the robustness and flexibility of the energy concept and the design, depending on the climate it is built in. Different climates are selected for the analyses, reaching from climates with extreme winters (Canada: Saskatoon) to arid climates (US: Las Vegas), through milder climates (Belgium: Ukkel and US: Washington D. C.). To cover both locally (Belgian) and internationally used energy-assessment procedures both the Flemish EPB-software as well as the PHPP-software are used. Furthermore, dynamic simulations in Trnsys are carried out to obtain more detailed and accurate feedback on the buildings’ dynamic thermal response. Through simulations with these three calculation methods, energy robustness is tested and alternative solutions for the building envelope are proposed, adapting the building to its boundary conditions.

The main aim {{of this study is to}} inform the redesign of <b>flexible</b> energy-efficient <b>housing</b> units. The housing, designed for social tenants, was built by the Accent Group in 2005, using modern construction methods and sustainable materials, based on extensive research from the adaptable and “Grow Home” principles of Avi Friedman as well as open building implementation. The first pilot scheme was designed in collaboration with the Building Energy Analysis Unit at the University of Sheffield, together with the Goddard Wybor Practise, and was a successful housing development with respect to being environmentally friendly and a low-energy design scheme for the UK climate. This paper presents redesigning of <b>flexible</b> terraced <b>housing</b> units, and their performance evaluation, using a building simulation method as well as the passive-house planning package. The aim was to plan a row of terraced houses that can not only utilize a flexible design concept in floor planning layout, but also to reduce energy consumption with a passive design with particular attention paid to material selection. In addition, building simulation work has been carried out with the use of DesignBuilder software for both thermal and energy performance evaluation. The study examines the annual energy performance and comfort conditions in the designed house to be situated in the Northeast of England, UK. A terraced house unit design is considered a flexible home that can adjust to the needs of different tenants for the purpose of achieving a sustainable building under different aspects, such as low energy, low carbon, use of renewables, and low impact materials, with flexibility by design...|$|R

The present study reveals {{that a person who}} tries to meet his immediate shelter needs satisfies with a mere house, but once he tends to modify his living space, particularly the extension of the house. An attempt to create a personalized living environment. Further, it reveals that socioeconomic advancement of people, mostly in terms of income and social status, as the major cause, which catalyze this process. In some societies, Socio economic mobility of people may result their movement to new locations. This phenomenon was noted insignificant in the studied housing scheme in Sri Lanka, where people have taken the alternative of adapting their houses to meet new housing needs. This phenomenon is most often not visualized by the designers. So that mass housing schemes are under a threat of becoming organized slums due to haphazard modifications. Therefore it is argued that the possibility of Socio - economic mobility of people should also be considered in designing housing for them.

40|$|The Open Building (OB) and {{the concept}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>housing</b> has alwaysassociated with user’s ability to respond to {{changing}} demand. It is necessary that housing can adap to changing market conditions and different users’ requirements. Flexibility makes a crucial concept that one cannot ignore. However, extra investments for future flexibility are still hardly made because the early investments affect different parties that are not involved in the future adaptation thus made it unaffordable to the mass. Also, the final life-cycle costs incurred in considering alternative solutions are more important than simply investing extra money in providing for flexibility (R. P. Geraedts). Our societyandeconomy are always changing. Nonetheless, the way we produce, the linear system that contains make-take-ispose consumption, had not changed since the started off an industrial revolution a long time ago. Thus, resulted in scarcity, depletion and waste of resources, environmental pollution, and climate change. Innovative leasing using circular economy(CE) is a recent way of looking at sustainability.

40|$|AbstractOver decades, {{the housing}} sector in Yemen has {{suffered}} from housing supply shortages and the inability to meet the households’ housing demands. Since the Unification of Northern and Southern territories of Yemen in the 1990 s, the issue of housing affordability {{has become a major}} concern in the growing urban sectors of the Yemeni cities including Aden. While, before Unification, the people in Aden have utilized public welfare housing where only they paid a nominal rent for their housing. The people were unaccustomed to a home purchase. After Unification, however the government has discontinued the welfare housing system, and the private sector has dominated the market for the housing service provision. This paper aims to investigate the residents’ perception of the affordability of housing provided by the private sector, {{and the extent to which}} the private housing schemes are able to meet the housing needs of Aden (the economic and commercial capital of Yemen) population. A questionnaire survey was conducted. The sample of the study was 369 of resident's respondents. The results of the study showed that the housing cost in Aden was beyond the reach of the majority of the population and that most families in Aden were financially incapable of purchasing the private houses without credit availability. It also showed that the majority of the respondents in both projects assisted that their housing condition is inadequate in quality. The study recommends that efforts should be undertaken by the local housing authority to facilitate financial support to potential home buyers of low-cost housing projects as well as enforcing more <b>flexible</b> <b>house</b> purchase mechanism for the benefit of the people. On the supply side, it is also important for the housing developers to enhance their performance level during the housing construction stages.

40|$|The rapid {{socio-economic}} {{development in}} China {{has given rise}} to the problem of housing obsolescence. The reduction of housing obsolescence and the increase in housing service life are important from the perspective of sustainable development. In extant literature, flexibility has been introduced as an important method to reduce housing obsolescence. However, no empirical evidence exists to illustrate the effects of flexibility on reducing housing obsolescence. Therefore, by correlating knowledge on flexibility and housing obsolescence, this study attempts to explore the effects of flexibility on reducing urban housing obsolescence with special focus on Chinese <b>flexible</b> <b>housing</b> practices during the mid- 1980 s to the early 1990 s. The research question which this study attempts to address is whether housing obsolescence can be obviously reduced by flexibility in Chinese <b>flexible</b> <b>housing</b> practices during the mid- 1980 s to the early 1990 s. First, the theoretical framework of this research explains Chinese flexible approaches within the context of Chinese housing development since 1949. Second, it explores the mechanism of obsolescence in <b>flexible</b> <b>housing</b> practices during the mid- 1980 s to the early 1990 s. The internal and external threat of housing obsolescence is discussed. A cross-national comparison is also made to understand the context of these practices. Third, theoretical framework suggests two scenarios and three theoretical propositions, and it specifies three key factors for analyzing the effects of flexibility on the reduction of housing obsolescence: changeability, housing obsolescence, and changing behavior by dwellers. Finally, it establishes a methodology for empirical investigation. Six Chinese neighborhoods built during the mid- 1980 s to the early 1990 s which contain both flexible houses and similar ordinary houses are selected as cases according to screening criteria. Data are obtained by survey among households, interviews, analysis of archival records, and on-site observation. The main unit of analysis is a type of flat. The data analysis revolves around the three propositions put forward. The results of the empirical study indicate that the six cases do not agree with the three propositions. First, {{only a small number of}} households use the pre-set changeability in flexible flats. Second, flexible flats do not have a much lower score in housing obsolescence than similar ordinary flats. Third, the score on housing obsolescence for households who use changeability is not obviously lower than that for households who do not. These findings are discussed within the theoretical framework. In general, this research does not support the notion that flexibility in the <b>flexible</b> <b>housing</b> can reduce housing obsolescence obviously in the given context. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

This is attributed to the low hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile when unsaturated. Capillary rise was prevented when using a geocomposite between two soil layers, due to the presence of an air gap in the geonet between the two geotextiles.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} ideas of {{recognition}} and the intercultural {{as a way}} of examining the impact of welfare conditionality on Indigenous housing policy in Australia. The increased application of welfare conditionality has occurred in tandem with „mainstreaming‟ of housing management and provision, and regulation of Indigenous Community Organisations. (ICOs). These developments raise policy and practice questions about the effectiveness of such approaches in achieving desired housing outcomes because of questions about their alignment with Indigenous norms and values. The paper argues that the embedded nature of individuals in their social and cultural locations requires the development of policy paradigms that are adapted to these realities. The idea of a recognition space extends the idea of conditionality to one involving moral relationships of duty and care between the individual, Indigenous formal and informal governance structures and the state and its agents.
