5|$|One of the outlaws, a {{black man}} named James Middleton, leaves {{the safety of the}} group to be with his wife, Pauline. James is {{subsequently}} killed by Loco when he takes Pauline hostage. Vengeful, Pauline writes to Silence, requesting him to kill Loco. Meanwhile, the newly-elected Governor, hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws, assigns the righteous but bumbling soldier Gideon Burnett as the sheriff of Snow Hill. On his way, Burnett encounters the outlaws, who steal his horse for food. After <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the snow, he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence, and later, Loco. Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline, who promises to raise his reward.|$|E
5|$|The group, {{with the}} legal {{authority}} and financial assistance of SirDoi, buy {{the help of the}} town of Ochiai {{in order to create a}} trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head into town and the trap. During the assassins' own journey to the town, they are attacked by ronin who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to head through the mountains but end up <b>getting</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>In</b> the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide; Shinzaemon eventually recruits him as the thirteenth assassin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the prefectural {{government}} of Hokkaidō, Japan's northernmost island, were offering various grants and incentives for mainland Japanese groups willing to relocate there. At the time, Hokkaidō was still largely unsettled by the Japanese, being occupied primarily by the indigenous Ainu. In 1910, Ueshiba travelled to Hokkaidō in the company of his acquaintance Denzaburo Kurahashi, who had lived on the northern island before. His intent was to scout out a propitious location for a new settlement, and he found the site at Shirataki suitable for his plans. Despite the hardships he suffered on this journey (which included <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> snowstorms several times and an incident in which he nearly drowned in a freezing river), Ueshiba returned to Tanabe filled with enthusiasm for the project, and began recruiting families to join him. He became the leader of the Kishū Settlement Group, a collective of eighty-five pioneers who intended to settle in the Shirataki district and live as farmers; the group founded the village of Yubetsu (later Shirataki village) in August, 1912. Much of the funding for this project came from Ueshiba's father and his brothers-in-law Zenzo and Koshiro Inoue. Zenzo's son Noriaki was also a member of the settlement group.|$|E

5|$|The Buccaneers, {{making their}} NFL debut against the Houston Oilers, {{averaged}} {{less than two}} yards per offensive play. They were unable to score despite being given good field position by two Oiler fumbles. Steve Spurrier completed 8 of 21 passes for 36 yards, and starting running backs Jimmy DuBose and Louis Carter rushed for 12 yards on 15 carries. Despite being outgained 169 to 8 by the second quarter, they were only behind 7–0 and missed a chance to tie the score when Lee McGriff dropped a Spurrier pass in the end zone. A later drive ended when Spurrier overthrew John McKay, Jr., instead hitting defender C.L. Whittington. A third chance to tie the score was lost when Mark Cotney dropped an interception of a Dan Pastorini pass with a clear path to the end zone. Whittington gave the Buccaneers {{the ball on the}} Oiler 11-yard line by fumbling a punt, but then killed the Buccaneers’ scoring chances by intercepting another Spurrier pass. Ronnie Coleman ran 25 times for 142 yards for the Oilers. McKay expressed concern over the team’s offense after the defeat, and responded to a reporter’s taunt of “I thought you said you were going to win some games?” by saying, “Houston has been in the league 6,000 years and still hasn’t won a championship. The Bucs will be heard from”. It was a day with a bad beginning, middle, and ending for the Buccaneers. The day began with the Buccaneers <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the maze-like Astrodome interior, and ended with the team’s charter plane bouncing and rolling before righting itself on landing. In addition, starting tackle Dave Reavis was injured during pregame warmups and was lost for the season.|$|E

Guidelines may be permanent or laid and recovered during the dive, using cave reels to deploy and recover the line. Permanent branch lines may be laid with {{a gap between the}} start of the branch line and the nearest point on the main line. Gap spools with a relatively short line are commonly used to make the jump.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a compass}} in Greenland {{involves}} accounting {{for a very}} extreme magnetic declination. Failure to calculate correctly can send a hunter in the wrong direction, leading to complete loss of bearings. <b>Getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> bad weather can waste precious time, forcing the hunter to overnight in very wet, cold, and unpleasant conditions. Hypothermia can further complicate matters and decrease the hunter's ability to think clearly, causing them to lose their bearings even more. A fight for survival may then ensue. Deaths are relatively rare, but they do happen.|$|E

500|$|The {{layout of}} the first two Megami Tensei games were noticeably {{different}} from later games: Megami Tensei used a 3D first-person perspective, while Megami Tensei II used a combination of first-person 3D displays for battle and top-down 2D displays for navigation. The change was suggested by staff members who did not want players <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a large 3D environment. The 2D/first person viewpoint continued until Nocturne, which switched to a third-person perspective. This was done due to a condition similar to car sickness called [...] "3D sickness" [...] with first person shooters in Japan at the time: the developers wanted something for players to focus on. The first-person perspective was reintroduced in Strange Journey, and incorporated into IVs battles along with navigable 3D environments.|$|E

On 26 November 1937 MacLachlan once again passed as an [...] "above average" [...] pilot. He was promptly posted to No. 88 Squadron RAF at RAF Boscombe Down.

Several crew members were injured during the shoot, {{and because of the}} cabin's remoteness, {{securing}} medical assistance was difficult. One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask.

Through most of 1996, they competed in the tag team division with no major storylines and never reached the same heights as when they were champions. They were able to defeat other mid-card teams like the Faces of Fear, and they competed in a dark match prior to Slamboree 1996, defeating The Shark and Maxx. They were consistently defeated by the company's top tag teams, and Pro Wrestling Illustrated noted that they were <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "very deep" [...] tag team division that included The Road Warriors, Public Enemy, Harlem Heat, The Nasty Boys, the Blue Bloods, Lex Luger and Sting, Four Horsemen, The Steiner Brothers, and The Outsiders, among others.|$|E
500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why." ...|$|E

500|$|The level design {{received}} mixed comments. Mueller called {{some of them}} [...] "extremely frustrating". Helgeson {{stated that}} the fast-paced [...] "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for Game Informer, called the level design [...] "disastrous". Official Xbox Magazine was more mixed, balancing the possibility of <b>getting</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D Sonic gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed Sonic Heroes. GameTrailers found that [...] "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the Sonic universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops {{and an assortment of}} other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." [...] Bettenhausen included [...] "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" [...] of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina deplored the [...] "stupid level design", adding that [...] "Just because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." [...] GameSpy observed that [...] "the areas are much less open than in previous Sonic games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." [...] Nintendo Power singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.|$|E
