5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some <b>Jewish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> colonists.|$|E

5|$|Under the British Mandate, Haifa {{became an}} {{industrial}} port city. The Bahá'í Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port {{was a major}} source of income, and the nearby towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian Hauran. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, <b>Jewish,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Haifa had a population of 24,634, consisting of 9,377 Muslims, 6,230 Jews and 8,863 Christians. In 1938, 52,000 Jews and 51,000 Muslims and Christians lived in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|In 634 CE Gaza was {{besieged by}} the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As {{following}} the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine. It {{was captured by}} Amr's forces about three years later. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by 'Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, although its Byzantine garrison was massacred. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought significant changes to Gaza; at first some of its churches were transformed into mosques, including the present Great Mosque of Gaza (the oldest in the city), which was later rebuilt by Sultan Baibars, who endowed it with a huge manuscript library containing over 20,000 manuscripts in the 13th century, {{a large segment of}} the population swiftly adopted Islam, Arabic became the official language. In 767 Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; he founded the Shafi'i religious code, one of the four major Sunni Muslim schools of law (fiqh). Security, which was well-maintained during early Muslim rule, was the key to Gaza's prosperity. Although alcohol was banned in Islam, the <b>Jewish</b> <b>and</b> <b>Christian</b> communities were allowed to maintain wine production, and grapes, a major cash crop of the city, were exported mainly to Egypt.|$|E
