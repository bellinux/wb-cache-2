5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, {{there were}} U.S. Congressional {{hearings}} regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group NICAP had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few {{allies in the}} U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics—most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP asserting that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book's budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book's critics, that {{but it was only}} temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be <b>even</b> <b>louder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Canines often fear, {{and exhibit}} stress {{responses}} to, loud noises. Noise-related anxieties in dogs may {{be triggered by}} fireworks, thunderstorms, gunshots, and <b>even</b> <b>loud</b> or sharp bird noises. Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety, such as a change in barometric pressure being associated with a thunderstorm, thus causing an anticipatory anxiety.|$|R
60|$|The {{men were}} not allowed to build fires lest the lights should be seen by those in the fort, and so {{cautious}} was the leader that <b>even</b> <b>loud</b> talking was forbidden, therefore the men could do little else than spend the time in sleeping, a fact by no means disagreeable to the majority after their march of the day.|$|R
50|$|They {{normally}} include different triggering {{mechanisms to}} cope with different emergency situations. Common triggering mechanisms include pressing and holding the phone's switch button for a few seconds, shaking the phone vigorously, tapping on an alert button, and <b>even</b> <b>loud</b> screaming sound which the app can detect. When the alert signal is triggered, these apps automatically go to work, sending text messages and emails with exact location of the user to emergency contacts listed on the app.|$|R
25|$|As {{would be}} expected, these fifes were notably more {{internally}} in tune than most previous fifes, since {{the designs of}} the 1830s fell from favor, and had the added value of being tunable with each other (by sliding the joint or the head cork). In addition, they gave the player greater dynamic control and could be played <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than traditional fifes, {{the result of the}} lower cone in the bore. At first, only six hole (Model J) fifes were made, but by 1960, McDonagh designed and Seaman manufactured a 10-hole (Model L). Two of the holes were used by RH2 – covering only one of the two produced F natural. Some players found this quite difficult, so eventually (c. 1970s), an 11-hole model was introduced, the Model M, with both the original double RH2 holes and an RH thumb hole to choose from for the F natural. These were actually ideas derived from several makers of the days of the 19th century, including Giorgi, even though {{there was no need for}} F natural in traditional fife music.|$|E

2500|$|... 80 {{minutes before}} each performance, cheap {{standing}} room tickets are sold ( [...] to 4).

2500|$|... "Clip-on" [...] tuners {{typically}} {{attach to}} instruments with a spring-loaded clip {{that has a}} built-in contact microphone. Clipped onto a guitar headstock or violin scroll, these sense pitch <b>even</b> in <b>loud</b> environments, for example when other people are tuning.|$|R
5000|$|During in-character {{interviews}} on {{shows such}} as SMTV Live, Zippy is often portrayed as <b>even</b> more <b>loud</b> mouthed and crude than normal. An infamous [...] "Christmas tape" [...] of the series also displays cruder humour from the entire cast.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{the girls}} were {{arranging}} themselves in the drawing-room for the <b>evening,</b> a <b>loud</b> knocking was heard at the front-door, and Harriet and Anne both sprang up--the one exclaiming, 'Someone has brought Fido back!'--the other, 'Can that be Rupert?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Autzen {{is known}} for its crowd noise. [...] Due to the stadium's {{relatively}} small footprint, the fans are very close to the action, and the field is sunken. [...] These factors contribute to the loudness of the stadium even though it is smaller than other 'noise comparable' stadiums. [...] According to many in the Pac-12, it was actually <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> prior to the most recent expansion because the noise reverberated {{all the way up the}} stadium and bounced back down to the field—the so-called [...] "Autzen bounce." [...] Oregon officials say that any future expansions will trap more noise.|$|E

50|$|The {{avalanche}} is {{a well-known}} problem with large piles of snow and ice crystals on steep slopes. In dry conditions, snow slopes act similarly to sandpiles. An entire mountainside of snow can suddenly slide due {{to the presence of}} a skier, or <b>even</b> a <b>loud</b> noise or vibration.|$|R
60|$|The {{splashing}} continued--grew <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than before. A warrior {{came into}} view, then another, and another. They walked close together. Two more followed.

6000|$|But now a {{blinding}} {{flash of lightning}} lit up the scene, and then came another crash of thunder, <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than before. Billy reared up, and then came down with a leap.

60|$|Before Malcolm {{had time}} to answer him there was a {{tremendous}} crash which threw them off their feet.

5000|$|The {{complaints}} of Phantosmia include unpleasant odors most commonly including [...] "burnt", [...] "foul", [...] "rotten", [...] "sewage", [...] "metallic" [...] or [...] "chemical". These odors may {{be triggered by}} strong odorants, changes in nasal airflow or <b>even</b> <b>loud</b> sounds, whereas sometimes it occurs spontaneously. Patients having {{complaints of}} Phantosmia self-admit a poor quality of life, with each meal having the unpleasant odor as well. The disorder's first onset, usually spontaneous, lasts only a few minutes. Its recurrences are then gradually increased from monthly, then weekly, and then daily {{over a period of}} 6 months to a year. The duration of the perceived odor also increases over same time, often lasting most of a day after 1 year.Some patients also state that the odor they smell is different from any known odor.|$|R

60|$|With a shout of joy he rode {{forward to}} the party who had viewed with astonishment this {{conflict}} between {{what appeared to be}} three of the infidels. <b>Even</b> <b>louder</b> than his first shout of exultation was the cry of joy which he raised at seeing among the party to whom he rode up the Earl of Evesham, who reined in his horse in astonishment, and drew his sword as the supposed enemy galloped toward him.|$|E
60|$|The crying sounded <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> out of doors. It {{was as if}} all {{the pain}} in the world had found a voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the next room, and had it been dumb, I believe--I have thought since--I could have stood it well enough. It is when {{suffering}} finds a voice and sets our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us. But in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees waving in the soothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion, blurred with drifting black and red phantasms, until I was out of earshot of the house in the chequered wall.|$|E
60|$|At {{the very}} instant expected, the special train was signalled, and {{drove into the}} crimson station amid the thunder of artillery, the blare of trumpets, the beating of drums, and cheers from {{thousands}} <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> and longer than {{the voices of the}} cannon. Leaning on the arm of her brother, and attended by the Princess of Montserrat, and the Honourable Adriana Neuchatel, Baron Sergius, the Duke of St. Angelo, the Archbishop of Tyre, and Lord Waldershare, the daughter of William Ferrars, gracious, yet looking as if she were born to empire, received the congratulatory address of the mayor and corporation and citizens of Nethampton, and permitted her hand to be kissed, not only by his worship, but by at least two aldermen.|$|E

50|$|Through 1985, {{there was}} a Funhouse located on the site now {{occupied}} by the Dragon.

60|$|He had {{now come}} {{to the mouth of}} the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the {{darkness}} he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.|$|E
60|$|After {{three days}} of incessant labour, they heard, soon after {{starting}} from their last halting-place, a roar <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> and more menacing than they had yet experienced. Cautiously they got {{as close as possible}} to the side, and paddling against the stream were able to effect a landing just above the rapid. On examining it they found that it was nearly half a mile long, and in this distance the water made a fall of some eighty feet, the stream being broken everywhere with ledges and jagged rocks, among which the waves lashed themselves into a white foam. It seemed madness to attempt such a descent, and they agreed that at any rate they would halt for the day. The rocks through which the cañon ran were fully a thousand feet high, but they decided that, great as the labour might be, it would be better to make a portage, if possible, rather than descend the cataract.|$|E
60|$|The firing became again tremendous, and {{the sound}} was <b>even</b> <b>louder</b> than during {{the attack on the}} zeriba. As each fresh {{battalion}} was brought into line the tumult steadily increased. The three leading brigades continued to advance westward in one long line looped up over Surgham Hill, and with the right battalion held back in column. As the forces gradually drew nearer, the possibility of the Dervishes penetrating the gap between Lewis and MacDonald presented itself, and the flank battalion was wheeled into line so as to protect the right flank. The aspect of the Dervish attack was at this moment most formidable. Enormous masses of men were hurrying towards the smoke-clouds that almost hid MacDonald. Other masses turned to meet the attack which was developing on their right. Within the angle formed by the three brigades facing west and MacDonald facing nearly south a great army of not fewer than 15,000 men was enclosed, like a flock of sheep in a fold, by the thin brown lines of the British and Egyptian brigades. As the 7th Egyptians, the right battalion of Lewis's brigade and nearest the gap between that unit and MacDonald, deployed to protect the flank, they became unsteady, began to bunch and waver, and actually made several retrograde movements. There was a moment of danger; but General Hunter, who was on the spot, himself ordered the two reserve companies of the 15th Egyptians under Major Hickman to march up behind them with fixed bayonets. Their morale was thus restored and the peril averted. The advance of the three brigades continued.|$|E

50|$|Deafness {{is defined}} as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to {{understand}} speech even in the presence of amplification. In profound deafness, <b>even</b> the <b>loudest</b> sounds produced by an audiometer (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.|$|R
