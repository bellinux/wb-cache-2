30|$|There {{was a good}} {{agreement}} between the Cauchy and Hencky strain tensors in all calculations. Furthermore, the final accumulated strains were relatively insensitive to variations {{in the number of}} strain <b>increments.</b> This number was chosen as a compromise between few <b>increments</b> with larger image distortion, and many <b>increments</b> with more accumulated noise. The maximum number of <b>increments</b> was limited by the image capturing speed; the minimum number of <b>increments</b> was limited by the image correlation algorithm. With too few <b>increments,</b> there were unresolved areas around the narrow bands of largest strain due to high image distortion. The agreement between the Cauchy and Hencky strains indicate that the strain <b>increments</b> used were small enough for the accumulated strain to be close to the true strain.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{quantify}} {{relationships between the}} biometric parameters of young, 15 -year old spruce stands at the Experimental Site Vrchslatina. In 2011, 40 spruce trees were selected to cover four classes of bio-sociological status (dominant, co-dominant, sub-dominant, and suppressed - 10 individuals each). The trees were measured for their height <b>increments</b> (by recording the distances between the successive whorls) and the <b>increments</b> of lateral branches at all whorls. The sample trees were then cut down and discs {{were taken from the}} stem base. In the laboratory, the discs were measured for the annual ring widths using WinDendro software. We focused on detailed analyses {{of the relationship between the}} bio-sociological status of the trees on the radial and height <b>increments.</b> Minor differences were found in the <b>increments</b> in the newest lateral whorls. The ratio between height <b>increments</b> and lateral branch <b>increments</b> was found to be higher in dominant trees (height <b>increments</b> is two times higher than the <b>increments</b> on the lateral branches). Conversely, the smallest ratio was found in suppressed trees (the ratio was around 1). The ratio between tree height and diameter at the stem base, as well as the ratio between height and radial <b>increments,</b> was the smallest for dominant and the highest for suppressed trees. Hence, relationships between height and diameter <b>increments</b> (both annual and cumulative) proved to reflect competition intensity among trees...|$|R

Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, {{a decision was made}} to start a new production series. The first five of this third <b>increment,</b> known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E

The self- excitation captures the microscopic origin of the emergent endogenous self-organization properties, such as the energy cascade in turbulent flows, the triggering of aftershocks by previous earthquakes and the "reflexive" interactions of financial markets. The SEMF process has all the standard stylized facts found in financial time series, which are robust to the specification of the parameters and {{the shape of the}} memory kernel: multifractality, heavy tails of the distribution of <b>increments</b> with intermediate asymptotics, zero correlation of the signed <b>increments</b> and long-range correlation of the squared <b>increments,</b> the asymmetry (called "leverage" effect) of the correlation between <b>increments</b> and absolute value of the <b>increments</b> and statistical asymmetry under time reversal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBased on {{geometric}} considerations, longitudinal (δu (L) (τ)) and trans-verse (δu (L) ⊥ (τ)) Lagrangian velocity <b>increments</b> {{are introduced}} as com-ponents along, and perpendicular to, {{the displacement of}} fluid particles during a time scale τ. It is argued that these two <b>increments</b> probe pref-erentially the stretching and spinning of material fluid elements, respec-tively. This property is confirmed (in the limit of vanishing τ) by exam-ining the variances of these <b>increments</b> conditioned on the local topology of the flow. These longitudinal and transverse Lagrangian <b>increments</b> are found to share some qualitative features with their Eulerian counterparts. In particular, direct numerical simulations at R λ up to 300 show that the distributions of δu (L) (τ) are negatively skewed at all τ, which is a signature of time irreversibility in the Lagrangian framework. Transverse <b>increments</b> are found more intermittent than longitudinal <b>increments,</b> as quantified by the comparison of their respective flatnesses and scaling laws.

40|$|For a rotatory dual-head {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) system, how to determine the rotation <b>increments</b> is an open problem. In this study, we simulated {{the characteristics of a}} rotatory dual-head PET system. The influences of different rotation <b>increments</b> were compared and analyzed. Based on this simulation, the imaging performance of a prototype system was verified. A reconstruction flowchart was proposed based on a precalculated system response matrix (SRM). The SRM made the relationships between the voxels and lines of response (LORs) fixed; therefore, we added the interpolation method into the flowchart. Five metrics, including spatial resolution, normalized mean squared error (NMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR), and structure similarity (SSIM), were applied to assess the reconstructed image quality. The results indicated that the 60 ° rotation <b>increments</b> with the bilinear interpolation had advantages in resolution, PSNR, NMSE, and SSIM. In terms of CNR, the 90 ° rotation <b>increments</b> were better than other <b>increments.</b> In addition, the reconstructed images of 90 ° rotation <b>increments</b> were also flatter than that of 60 ° <b>increments.</b> Therefore, both the 60 ° and 90 ° rotation <b>increments</b> could be used in the real experiments, and which one to choose may depend on the application requirement...|$|R

Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and numerical results on intermittency in hydrodynamic turbulence and scalar trans-port are described, with {{special emphasis on}} the Lagrangian evolution. First, we derive the advected delta-vee system. This simple dynamical system deals with the Lagrangian evolution of two-point velocity and scalar <b>increments</b> in turbulence [1, 2]. It shows that ubiquitous trends of three-dimensional turbulence such as exponential or stretched exponential tails in the probability density functions of transverse velocity incre-ments, as well as negatively skewed longitudinal velocity <b>increments,</b> emerge quite rapidly and naturally from initially Gaussian ensembles. Further extensions of the system are shown to provide simple expla-nations for other known intermittency trends in turbulence: (i) that transverse velocity <b>increments</b> {{tend to be more}} intermittent than longitudinal ones, (ii) that in two dimensions, vorticity <b>increments</b> are inter-mittent while velocity <b>increments</b> are not, (iii) that scalar <b>increments</b> typically become more intermittent than velocity <b>increments</b> and, finally, (iv) that velocity <b>increments</b> in four-dimensional turbulence are more intermittent than in three dimensions. While the origin of these important trends can thus be elucidated qualitatively, predicting quantitatively the statistically steady-state levels and dependence on scale remains an open problem that would require including the neglected effects of pressure, inter-scale interactions and viscosity...|$|R
