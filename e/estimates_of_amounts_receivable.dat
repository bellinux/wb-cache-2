40|$|The paper uses {{existing}} Markov chain {{theory to}} analyze problem of claim payment delayed process, which serves to <b>estimate</b> a distribution <b>of</b> paid/unpaid claims after payment due. Payment condition patterns {{and timing of}} claim payments play significant role in financial management. First, the corresponding data reported in usual accounting reports are extracted to yield records of delayed payment structures. Data processing procedure issues estimations of transitions probabilities of absorption Markov chain with several transition states and two absorption ones representing paid and unpaid claims, respectively. Fundamental matrix of absorption Markov chain is calculated by matrix inversion operation and used for averaged paid/unpaid claims estimation provided a vector of pending payments distributed in transient states is given. The goal of procedure is to determine bad debt losses expected after accounts receivable are arranged by aging schedule and the payment time forbearance is given. All these calculations are illustrated on the case study analyzing after-payment-due process of accounts receivable in selected SME company from West Bohemia region. The main contribution of the paper is dependence investigation <b>of</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>receivables</b> and expected losses from uncollectible accounts upon variable payment time forbearance defined prospectively by financial management of the company.

50|$|Studies don’t {{generally}} {{attempt to}} quantify the average strength of selection propagating advantageous mutations in the human genome. Many models make assumptions about how strong selection is, {{and some of the}} discrepancies between the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> adaptive evolution occurring have been attributed to the use of differing such assumptions (Eyre-Walker 2006). The way to accurately estimate the average strength of positive selection acting on the human genome is by inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new advantageous mutations in the human genome, but this DFE is difficult to infer because new advantageous mutations are very rare (Boyko et al. 2008). The DFE may be exponential shaped in an adapted population (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007). However, more research is required to produce more accurate <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> the average strength of positive selection in humans, which will in turn improve the <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> adaptive evolution occurring in the human genome (Boyko et al. 2008).|$|R
