5|$|On January 14, 2015, a GO bus on Highway 407 near Weston Road hit a <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> {{and rolled}} into a ditch.

5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median {{have given way to}} a steel <b>guard</b> <b>rail,</b> and most {{recently}} to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Depailler {{joined the}} newly formed Alfa Romeo team, that was on a {{comeback}} trail: Depailler had worked his way back from a hang-gliding accident the previous year, and had equipped his car with special brakes designed to toughen his leg muscles, he was still driving in pain {{by the time of}} his fatal accident and the car was fast (he qualified 3rd for the 1980 United States Grand Prix West) but not reliable enough to finish. He was killed testing for the 1980 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, when a suspension failure pitched his car into the Armco at the high-speed Ostkurve, inflicting fatal head injuries when the vehicle overturned and vaulted the barrier. The Alfa Romeo skidded {{along the top of the}} <b>guard</b> <b>rail</b> for several hundred feet prior to flipping onto its top.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May 1967 Bandini {{was racing}} at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, {{when he lost}} control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered the chicane when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the <b>guard</b> <b>rail,</b> sending him into an erratic skid. It {{impacted}} a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, fuel leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the fuel tank exploded after Bandini had been {{pulled away from the}} Ferrari.|$|E
