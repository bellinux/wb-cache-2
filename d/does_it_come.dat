While three states have limitation on distribution of e-cigarettes, {{there is no}} restriction {{in any of the}} remaining Indian states. Currently, this product is not a drug as per the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, and neither <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> {{under the jurisdiction of the}} tobacco department as it does not contain tobacco.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin of IndieWire {{praised the}} {{animation}} and art direction, but {{wrote that he}} wished [...] "the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy" [...] and that [...] "Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that's merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying [...] "Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it [...] "never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop {{in the manner of}} the best Pixar stories. Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it [...] "may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying [...] "It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A− and said it [...] "is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic. The delightful story of when Mike met Sulley puts those concerns to rest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three stars out of four and wrote [...] "Although it falls short of the best Pixar has brought to the screen over its long association with Disney, it's nevertheless worth a trip to the theater, especially for kids." ...|$|E

5000|$|Author David Weber {{says the}} genesis {{for this book}} began with a question: [...] "Assume that Earth doesn't {{actually}} have a Moon, but rather a giant starship disguised as our Moon which {{has been there for}} at least 50 or 60,000 years. Where <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> from, why <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> here, and why hasn't it left?" [...] Weber says the answer to those questions built the foundation for this book and its sequels.|$|R
2500|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} {{that one might}} use [...] "a kind of ostensive definition" [...] for S, {{by focusing on the}} sensation and on the symbol. Early in The Investigations, Wittgenstein attacks the usefulness of ostensive definition. He considers the example of someone pointing to two nuts while saying [...] "This is called two". How <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> about that the listener associates this with the number of items, rather than the type of nut, their colour, or even a compass direction? One conclusion of this is that to participate in an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the process and context involved, of the form of life. Another is that [...] "an ostensive definition can be variously interpreted in every case".|$|E
2500|$|According to Hegel, {{the main}} {{characteristic}} of this unity {{was that it}} evolved through and manifested itself in contradiction and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of reality—consciousness, history, philosophy, art, nature, society—leads to further development until a rational unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (Aufhebung) to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, logical, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>come</b> to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [...] is not a thing or being that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process {{to an understanding of}} itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary {{to the extent that it}} is a philosophy of absolute negation: as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.|$|E
