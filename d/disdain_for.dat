5|$|Having {{declared}} his <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> the 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum {{as the first}} step in creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam. He repeatedly said that the creation of a legislature and a constitution for his new state would follow the referendum.|$|E
5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today. Although the English had an inherent <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients and dishes.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{rejected}} the colonial Western format of education system. He {{stated that it}} led to <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.|$|E

5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from a respectable family.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{incidents}} spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States. While the U.S. Congress {{and the general public}} expressed both support and <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Patton's actions, Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, Dabney's editorials {{took on a}} more {{conservative}} tone. Although he was personally opposed to Massive Resistance against desegregation of Virginia's public schools, {{the owners of the}} Times-Dispatch did not allow him to editorialize against it. He was offended by the student activists of the 1960s, and was ambivalent about the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., whom he admired for his courage but <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> his [...] "trouble-making" [...] and what Dabney termed [...] "unfair" [...] attacks on the Vietnam War.|$|R

6000|$|JULY 6th, {{complete}} OPEN-SESAME having come, Freytag and Schmidt duly invited Voltaire to {{be present}} {{at the opening of}} seals (his and theirs), and to have his moneys and effects returned from that [...] "old trunk" [...] he speaks of. But Voltaire had by this time taken a higher flight. July 6th, Voltaire was protesting before Notaries, about the unheard-of violence done him, the signal reparations due; and <b>disdained,</b> <b>for</b> the moment, to concern himself with moneys or opening of seals: [...] "Seals, moneys? Ye atrocious Highwaymen!" ...|$|R
5|$|According to a {{tradition}} originating with anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th-century, James's taste for political absolutism, his financial irresponsibility, and his cultivation of unpopular favourites established {{the foundations of}} the English Civil War. James bequeathed Charles a fatal belief in the divine right of kings, combined with a <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Parliament, which culminated in the execution of Charles and the abolition of the monarchy. Over the last three hundred years, the king's reputation has suffered from the acid description of him by Sir Anthony Weldon, whom James had sacked and who wrote treatises on James in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. From the time Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T. Barry, and Jesse Bledsoe. However, Holley's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky. Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E
5|$|At {{a school}} dance, Sean persuades Dallas {{to make peace}} with Clay while Clay dances with Chelsea. Spencer convinces Ashley to come despite her <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> school dances, but when Madison sees them together, she alleges that Spencer is gay and kicks Spencer off the cheerleading squad. It is {{revealed}} that Ashley was once pregnant by Aiden and lost the baby in a miscarriage, and when Glen tries to force Spencer to leave, another fight breaks out between him and Aiden. Spencer and Ashley flee the dance with Aiden and end up at a lookout over LA.|$|E
50|$|Some hailed, {{but others}} criticized, Korematsu's actions. Many Japanese {{residents}} {{living on the}} West Coast cooperated with the government internment order, hoping to prove their loyalty as Americans, including members of the Japanese American Citizens League. Korematsu was thus <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> his opposition to a government order, and was even seen as a threat {{in the eyes of}} many Japanese Americans. When Korematsu's family was moved to the Topaz internment camp, he later recalled feeling isolated because his imprisoned compatriots recognized him and many, if not most, of them felt that if they talked to him they would also be seen as troublemakers.|$|R

50|$|As a mixed-race student {{among white}} peers, Paulin had few friends, and {{performed}} poorly at school, failing his exams.

5|$|Despite Tchaikovsky's <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> public life, he now {{participated in}} {{it as part of}} his {{increasing}} celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season. In this post, he invited many international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's childrenWilhelm in particularheld various {{political}} positions and greatly influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced {{the horrors of}} war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents. Wilhelm grew up full of <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> their opinions on government, and shortly after his father's death, proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I. He made no reference to Frederick III. William II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1844 in Japan as the Tokugawa shogunate is in decline, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu of Akashi rapes, tortures, and murders his {{citizens}} at will. He is shielded {{because the}} Shogun is his half-brother. Sir Doi Toshitsura, the Shogun's Justice, {{realizes that the}} situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits seppuku {{as a way of}} showing <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers, led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings.|$|E
40|$|Very little {{research}} in software engineering {{has focused on}} the model of a programmer working alone. These so-called cowboys are <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> not working in teams to build software. In reality many cowboys work by themselves due to the circumstances of their work environment, not because they are unable or unwilling to work with well with others. These solo programmers could benefit from a methodology to assist them in consistently developing reliable software on time and within budget while satisfying the customer 2 ̆ 7 s needs. Cowboy was designed to help fill this void. This agile-based system incorporates the benefits of agile methodologies into a lightweight, customer-centered approach to software development for the lone developer.

5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many of his neighbors for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in the war would shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.|$|E
5|$|Miller's character, {{joie de vivre}} {{and love}} of cricket were {{expressed}} on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately {{allowed himself to be}} bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{are summarized in}} support of the view that mitochondria (including hydrogenosomes) and plastids (including complex ones) descend from symbiotic associations of once free-living organisms. The reasoning behind endosymbiotic hypotheses stems from a comparison of biochemistry and physiology in organelles with that in free-living cells; their strength is shown to lie in the specific testable predictions they generate about expected similarity patterns among genes. Although <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> many decades, endosymbiotic hypotheses have gradually become very popular. In the wake of that popularity, endosymbiotic hypotheses have been formulated to explain the origins of eukaryotic cell compartments and structures that have no biochemical similarity to free-living cells. In particular, it has become fashionable in recent years to entertain the century-old notion that the nucleus might also descend from an endosymbiotic bacterium. A critique of that hypothesis is formulated and a simple alternative to it is outlined, which derives the nuclear compartment in a mitochondrion-bearing cell...|$|R

5|$|On Long Island, {{thousands}} {{were left}} without power {{for over a}} week, until the last outages were restored {{two weeks after the}} storm on October8. The long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close, extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings, and price gouging on food, ice, and generators. The lack of power led to a general <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), which increased further when the company left the $40million (1985USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance. Citizens quickly protested LILCO's decision, and within years the publicly owned Long Island Power Authority was formed.|$|E
5|$|Robson's first {{match in}} charge saw {{immediate}} controversy, as he dropped Kevin Keegan for the match against Denmark. On 21 September 1983, Robson suffered his only {{loss in the}} 28 qualifying matches he was to undertake as England manager. The defeat, again to Denmark, ultimately led to England's failure {{to qualify for the}} 1984 European Championships and resulted in Robson offering to resign in favour of Brian Clough. The resignation was rejected by FA chairman Bert Millichip (primarily down to his and the FA's <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> Clough), and Robson went on to lead the England team to qualify for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The gentry {{distinguished}} {{themselves in}} society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while {{the homes of}} prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the <b>disdain</b> <b>for</b> trade, commerce and the merchant class exhibited by the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played {{a prominent role in}} Song culture and society. A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this did not stop many scholar-officials from managing business relations through the use of intermediary agents.|$|E
40|$|Voltaire {{wanted to}} allot {{different}} functions and domains to verse and prose, but the prose notes which accompany his poems reveal exchanges and even interpénétration or interference between the two. The prose notes, which are developed {{to the extent}} that they sometimes submerge the poem and weave parallel networks totally unrelated to it, are not only a necessary digression, an extension indispensable for its comprehension and interpretation, but become in addition an important space for Voltaire to express his philosophy. Thus the invasive system of prose notes, which is active even if it does not concern all of its readers, is a decisive factor in the dethroning of poetry in favour of prose in Voltaire's work. Prose, at first <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> its facility and theoretical lack of elegance, manages finally, as a result of a progressive and inverse development, to replace poetry, which gradually loses its initial dominance and preeminence.

40|$|The trait-based {{perspective}} of leadership {{has a long}} but checkered history. Trait approaches dominated the initial decades of scientific leadership research. Later, they were <b>disdained</b> <b>for</b> their inability to offer clear distinctions be-tween leaders and nonleaders and for their failure to account for situational variance in leadership behavior. Recently, driven by greater conceptual, methodological, and statistical sophistication, such approaches have again risen to prominence. However, their contributions are likely to remain limited unless leadership researchers who adopt this perspective address several fundamental issues. The author argues that combinations of traits and at-tributes, integrated in conceptually meaningful ways, {{are more likely to}} predict leadership than additive or indepen-dent contributions of several single traits. Furthermore, a defining core of these dominant leader trait patterns re-flects a stable tendency to lead in different ways across disparate organizational domains. Finally, the author sum-marizes a multistage model that specifies some leader traits as having more distal influences on leadership processes and performance, whereas others have more proximal ef-fects that are integrated with, and influenced by, situational parameters...|$|R
