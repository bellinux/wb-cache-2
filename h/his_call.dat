5|$|Sledd first gained {{national}} recognition {{after he}} wrote a 1902 magazine article advocating better legal and social treatment of African-Americans. He is also prominently remembered {{for his role in}} founding the modern University of Florida, his scholarly analysis of biblical texts as literature, <b>his</b> <b>call</b> for an end to racial violence, and his influence on a generation of Methodist seminary students, scholars and ministers.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Marsh's {{action was}} again under {{scrutiny}} {{when he played}} his second shield match against Victoria in Melbourne. While Richard Callaway—the New South Wales umpire officiating the match—was satisfied with Marsh's bowling action, his Victorian counterpart Bob Crockett was concerned with the twisting of the bowler's wrist. Crockett no-balled Marsh {{three times in the}} match, but was reluctant to elucidate on the reasons for <b>his</b> <b>call.</b> Marsh took 3/39 and 3/51 respectively, dismissing Test batsmen Peter McAlister, Warwick Armstrong, Jack Worrall and Frank Laver. Marsh bowled three of his victims.|$|E
5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. <b>His</b> <b>call</b> was answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of The Lawyer to his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and <b>his</b> <b>call</b> to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused <b>his</b> <b>call</b> to arms.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a Navy SEAL team {{deploying}} on a Russian whaler, the Eastern Spirit, in the Bering Strait. As the team explore the deck, they are attacked and killed by something that literally rips them apart. Seeing his team is gone, CIA Special Agent Jason Bennett, who is supervising the mission from another location, orders any other government vessel in the vicinity to investigate. <b>His</b> <b>call</b> is {{picked up by the}} US Coast Guard ship, the USCGC Ravenswood, which heads to the Eastern Spirit. The crew of the Ravenswood split into teams, but within moments of boarding, only one remains; Tom Hansen, who hears his shipmates being killed over the radio. He sets out to explore the ship and determine what is happening.|$|E

5000|$|Howard's first {{experience}} of the United Church came when he was invited by a neighbouring white family to attend with them. This became {{a regular part of}} Howard's early life and eventually led to <b>his</b> <b>calling</b> to the ministry. [...] "The result", writes Adam Kilner in one of his biographies of Howard, [...] "was <b>his</b> <b>calling</b> into the ministry of a segregated church at a segregated time, even in polite Canada." ...|$|R
5|$|The media {{objected to}} Aberhart's plan to place his government's {{future in the}} hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the Calgary Herald called for an {{immediate}} election. To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured technocratic rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role. In the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, <b>his</b> <b>call</b> was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.|$|E
5|$|The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in Frankfort {{and chose}} Helm and John W. Stevenson as the party's {{candidates}} for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Helm resigned {{his seat in}} the state senate to accept the nomination. Though his health was frail, he determined to canvass the entire state. He continued <b>his</b> <b>call</b> for an end to Civil War bitterness and proscriptions against those who had sided with the Confederacy. He won the general election over Republican Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.|$|E
5|$|Willis renewed <b>his</b> <b>call</b> for {{an income}} tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were split on the issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws and stronger concealed weapons laws, and increased funding for black education. The war's end had brought additional revenue sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a schoolteacher, Kimball spent one {{semester}} at the University of Arizona {{in the spring of}} 1917, but he received an army draft notice later that year. During that time, he courted Camilla Eyring (18941987), a schoolteacher at Gila Academy (modern Eastern Arizona College), where Kimball had attended high school. They began dating in August 1917 and exchanged letters regularly after Kimball left for a semester at Brigham Young University (BYU) the next month. After one month at BYU, Kimball was notified that <b>his</b> <b>call</b> into the army was imminent, and he had to leave the university and return to his hometown. He returned to Arizona, but his army group was never called up for duty before World War I, ended with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|In the 1944 {{legislative}} session, {{the rival}} parties fought to a stalemate over the budget. The primary issue was deciding who would control the state's sizable budget surplusthe legislature or the governor. In {{an effort to}} unify the two sides, Willis backed off <b>his</b> <b>call</b> for a repeal of the income tax; another legislator proposed the repeal anyway, but it was defeated. Two months {{after the end of}} the session, Willis called a special session to reconcile the educational items in the budget. Once in session, legislators approved a full budget. The vote to accept the budget was deemed invalid, however, because approving a full budget was not part of Willis's initial call for a special session. In response, Willis called a second special session, and the Assembly passed a full budget on June 16, 1944.|$|E
5|$|Similar to his {{stint at}} Bastia, Diarra was {{included}} in the team as a starter by coach Joël Muller. The season was a major success for Diarra as he was the only player in the team to start every league match he played for the club. He also served as captain for a majority of the season. His consistent performances led to <b>his</b> <b>call</b> up to the senior national team. Diarra scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1–1 draw with Ajaccio. He scored the goal in the opening minute of the match. On 6 February 2005, Diarra scored the opener in team's 2–0 win over Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. He finished the campaign with 37 total appearances and two goals. Diarra also collected 11 yellow cards.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for <b>his</b> <b>call</b> to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer <b>his</b> <b>call,</b> but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape to the hallway. There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1095 Pope Urban II {{called for}} the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He {{encouraged}} military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, AlexiosI, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonising Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded <b>his</b> <b>call.</b> Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East–West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself {{as head of the}} unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church. Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God's forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain.|$|E

5|$|Willis had thus {{earned a}} second season at Surrey, and in 1970 played 14 Championship matches, taking 40 {{first-class}} wickets at 28.37, and 31 one day wickets at 14.65. Surrey came {{fifth in the}} Championship that year. He achieved a noteworthy performance in the Gillette Cup quarter-final against Middlesex. In a high-scoring match, Surrey made 280 {{for the loss of}} five wickets. Middlesex appeared to be coasting to victory when they reached 240–3, but Willis turned the game, and they collapsed and finished on 272–9. Willis took 6–49 in his 12 overs and won the Man of the Match award. Despite this, Surrey's preference for Geoff Arnold and Robin Jackman kept Willis out of the side on occasions. He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited <b>his</b> <b>call</b> up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate.|$|E
