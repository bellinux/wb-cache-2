50|$|The Great Machine has {{a variety}} of {{defensive}} systems, such as ground-to-air missiles. While most of these systems are unknown, one of the primary weapons is a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> weapon of enormous power capable of destroying an entire fleet of ships in a single, continuous burst.|$|E
50|$|Vorlon ships differ {{greatly from}} their Shadow counterparts. While smaller ships are equally maneuverable to Shadow vessels, Vorlon capital ships are large {{carriers}} {{that are less}} agile. While Shadow vessels utilize a powerful pinpoint <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> as their primary weapon, Vorlon ships have elongated structures resembling tentacles at the face of their ships that channel massive amounts of energy into capacitance, which are then fired as powerful beams of energy. This method of power generation and offensive capability was later adopted by the Interstellar Alliance into the creation of their prototype destroyer vessels several years after the Shadow War.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} of sensors and countermeasures provides a hemispherical protection. The overlapping {{sectors of the}} sensor-countermeasure modules enable the system to defeat multi-attacks. Due to the short reaction time of approximately 560 microseconds, threats can be eliminated at ranges of approximately 10 m, not depending on {{the speed of the}} threat. AMAP-ADS is one of the fastest active protection systems, faster than Quick Kill, Iron Fist or Trophy. Since the countermeasures create a non-fragmenting strong <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam,</b> collateral damage to nearby troops or civilians is minimized. These are important aspects in urban environments. In comparison to other hard-kill systems, there are no moving parts. This makes ADS light and reduces power requirements. Therefore, it can be installed on lightweight vehicles.|$|E

50|$|In the holodeck recreation, Krag {{demonstrates}} that a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> from where Riker was standing before transport struck the Krieger wave converter, destroying {{it and the}} station, but his theory is that Riker fired a phaser {{just as he was}} being transported. Riker presents his case first, with his simulation showing Apgar highly agitated with a Federation presence before he is ready for them, and Manua openly flirting with Riker. Manua then makes aggressive passes at Riker in the guest quarters when Apgar walks in on them, attempts to attack Riker, but Riker subdues him. Apgar leaves with Manua giving Riker a veiled threat. Riker's simulation concludes with his final confrontation with Apgar where Apgar tells Riker that he will lodge a formal complaint about Riker's behavior and accuses Riker of potentially damaging the project with baseless information in Riker's progress report.|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} for large angle slewing maneuvers with very demanding pointing accuracy and tracking speed is increasingly required for space-based systems. This is particularly {{the case for}} space-based <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> pointing. A method is thus proposed in this paper for commanding general pointing and tracking maneuvers with automatic correction for slew-excited structural deformations. All existing rigid body multiaxial slewing algorithms and flexible body vibration damping algorithms can then be used simultaneously, without design iterations. In particular, an example is given of a retargeting maneuver with specified line-of-sight settling time and no torque saturation...|$|E
40|$|Asteroids that {{threaten}} Earth could be deflected from their orbits using directed energy to vaporize the surface, as the ejected plume creates a reaction thrust that alters the asteroid’s trajectory. In this situation, {{a critical issue}} is {{the rotation of the}} asteroid relative to the <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam,</b> as this will reduce the average thrust magnitude and modify the thrust direction. Flux levels required to evaporate surface material depend on the surface material composition, rotation rate, albedo, and thermal and bulk mechanical properties of the asteroid. The observed distribution of asteroid rotation rates is used, along with an estimated range of material and mechanical properties, as input to a 4 D thermalphysical model to calculate the resultant thrust vector. The model uses a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam,</b> striking the surface of a rotating sphere with specified material properties, beam profile, and rotation rate. The model calculates thermal changes in the sphere, including vaporization and mass ejection of the target material. The amount of vaporization integrated over the target is used to determine the thrust magnitude and the phase shift relative to the non-rotating case. As the object rotates beneath the beam, the energy spreads out, decreasing temperature and vaporization causing both a phase shift and magnitude decrease in the average thrust vector. This produces a 4 D analytical model of the expected thrust profile for rotating objects...|$|E
40|$|Too often, {{military}} {{and law enforcement}} authorities have found themselves constrained by inadequate weaponry: the tools available to them, in addressing confrontations with entrenched opponents of various sorts, are either too weak (not sufficing to disarm or defeat the enemy) or too strong (generating unacceptable 2 ̆ 2 collateral damage 2 ̆ 2 in harming innocent people or property). An emerging category of 2 ̆ 2 non-lethal weapons 2 ̆ 2 carries promise for resolving this dilemma, proffering deft new capabilities for disabling, dissuading, or defeating opponents without inflicting death or permanent injury. Some primitive non-lethal weapons (such as truncheons, tear gas, and water cannon) have long been staples in the inventories of police and military forces in the United States and other countries. More sophisticated options (e. g., electronic stun guns or pepper spray) are becoming more common and are increasingly employed {{in a variety of}} law enforcement and security situations. Most dramatically, an array of much more sophisticated technologies (including <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beams,</b> calmative chemicals, and foam sprays that seal buildings or make an area impassively slippery) are being developed, and could emerge for use by soldiers and police in the near future. These augmented capabilities carry both immense promise and grave risks: they expand the power of law enforcement and military units, enabling them to accomplish assigned missions with greater finesse and reduced casualties. But they may also be misused, they may proliferate to malign applications, and they may inspire leaders to over-rely upon a myth of 2 ̆ 2 bloodless combat. 2 ̆ 2 This article explores the emerging world of non-lethal weapons by examining a series of case studies [...] recent real-world scenarios from three diverse confrontations around the world in which the availability of a modern arsenal of non-lethal weapons might have made a difference, enabling a more successful outcome in the face of deeply entrenched opposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} high-energy {{particles}} and their energy distribution {{is one of}} the primary challenges facing space physics and astrophysics. We consider two types of events where particle acceleration is observed: shocks and reconnection. We simulate both type of events with a fully kinetic and fully relativistic approach aimed at measuring directly particle acceleration. In each process we observe two types of effects: increase of <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> (creation of <b>beams)</b> and increase of plasma temperature. The two effects are intertwined as beams interact with the plasma through a variety of beaming instabilities and turn their <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> into thermal energy. However, often non Maxwellian distributions are observed. Our approach follows two paths. First, we investigate by <b>direct</b> simulation the <b>energy</b> distribution produced by reconnection, shocks and streaming instabilities. Second, we consider a general mathematical formulation that allows us to predict the distribution function of the high-energy particles. In particular, we derive a new approach to demonstrate the physical origin of power laws. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Composition {{of distant}} stars can be {{explored}} by observing absorption spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that {{passes through the}} cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system—asteroids, comets, planets, moons—are too cold to be interrogated in this manner. Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The concept utilizes a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> to melt and vaporize a spot on a distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With sufficient flux (~ 10 MW/m 2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature rises rapidly to ~ 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and ejected material creates a molecular plume {{in front of the}} spot. Bulk composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of these machines fabricate from raw material in powder form using a <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>beam</b> to create a local melt zone. Total hip replacement is recommended {{for people who have}} medical issues related to excessive wear of the acetabular, osteoarthritis, accident or age. Researches have shown that large numbers of hip arthroplasties (where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced), hip remodelling, or realignment are carried out annually and will increase in the next few decades. Manufacturing of acetabular shells by using AM is a promising and emerging method that has a great potential to improve public health. Lost wax casting or investment casting is currently used to produce acetabular shells followed by lengthy and complex secondary processes such as machining and polishing. Living organs and medical models have intricate 3 D shapes that are challenging to identity in X-ray CT images. These images are used for preparing treatment plans {{to improve the quality of}} the surgeries regarding waiting and surgery time per procedure and care regime. For instance, a limited number of hip replacement procedures can be carried out on each acetabulum due to a decrease of bone thickness. Rapid prototyping is a suitable treatment planning tool in complex cases to enhance the quality of surgical procedure and provide long-term stability that can be used to customize the shape and size of the acetabular shell. In this paper, to analyse the manufacturing of a prosthetic acetabular shell, built-up lines resulting from a thermal stress flow and process stopping during the selective laser melting (SLM) AM process, with regarding Gibbs free energy, interfacial energy, and equilibrium temperature will be discussed.

The nuclear reaction analysis showed very similar hydrogen depth profiles for all three types of samples. The atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon was approximately 0. 2 at the film surface and rose to approximately 1. 0 {{at a depth of}} 500 A. The integrated intensity of the C-H stretching band at about 2900 per cm indicates that the amount of chemically bonded hydrogen is less than the total hydrogen content. Combustion analysis confirmed the overall atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon determined by nuclear reaction analysis. The chemical state of the non-bonded hydrogen was not determined; however, the effective diffusion coefficient computed from the hydrogen depth profile was extremely low. This indicates either that the films are exceedingly impermeable or that the non-bonded hydrogen requires an additional activated step to leave the films, e. g., desorption or chemical reaction...|$|R
