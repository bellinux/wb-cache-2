5|$|The {{plates were}} paired {{in a double}} row along the back. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most common {{arrangement}} in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|After the {{purchase}} of the original site in 1919, {{the purchase}} of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> next most important in Gilwell Park's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase.|$|E

5|$|AlCl3 <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most {{commonly}} used Lewis acid and {{also one of the}} most powerful. It finds application in the chemical industry as a catalyst for Friedel–Crafts reactions, both acylations and alkylations. Important products are detergents and ethylbenzene. It also finds use in polymerization and isomerization reactions of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|De Iniusta is {{actually}} a composite work. The account of the trial itself, often termed the Libellus, is {{the central part of}} the work, and <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> original account. To the Libellus was added an introduction which summarises St-Calais' career prior to the trial. A conclusion which relates the bishop's life after the trial is appended to the end of the work. The introduction and conclusion are often referred to as the Vita, or Life.|$|E
5|$|Hexachloroplatinic acid {{mentioned}} above <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most important platinum compound, as {{it serves as}} the precursor for many other platinum compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, indelible ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.|$|E

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which {{have one of}} the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel was {{discovered}} by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless steel', which to this day <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most common alloy of this type.|$|E
5|$|The A center <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} defect in natural diamonds. It {{consists}} of a neutral nearest-neighbor pair of nitrogen atoms substituting for the carbon atoms. The A center produces UV absorption threshold at ~4 eV (310 nm, i.e. invisible to eye) and thus causes no coloration. Diamond containing nitrogen predominantly in the A form as classed as type IaA.|$|E

50|$|He was {{possibly}} a Conradine, a relative for sure of Adalard the Seneschal, a Girardid. Berengar <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> namesake of Berengar II of Neustria, who <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> son of Berengar I's successor, Henry of Franconia. He {{is believed to}} be the same person as Bérenger I, Count of Ivois.|$|R
50|$|Rede <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{son of the}} clothier Thomas Rede. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> William who <b>was</b> from Yate, Gloucestershire {{and married}} a {{daughter}} of the clothier, Walter Bailey. He had a son, Edward Rede. In 1554, he was described as 'of Bristol', suggesting a possible connection to William Rede I.|$|R
5|$|The Norman chapel in Durham Castle, {{built around}} 1078 by Saxon stonemasons, has what <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{earliest}} surviving artistic {{depiction of a}} mermaid in England. It {{can be seen on}} a south-facing capital above one of the original Norman stone pillars.|$|E
5|$|The most {{recognizable}} and famous animal of Puerto Rico <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> common coquí, a small endemic frog, {{and one of}} the 86 species that constitute Puerto Rico's herpetofauna. Some native freshwater fish inhabit Puerto Rico, but some species, introduced by humans, have established populations in reservoirs and rivers. The low richness-high diversity pattern is also apparent among invertebrates, which constitutes most of the archipelago's fauna. Also there are iguanas.|$|E
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property <b>is</b> (<b>probably)</b> <b>the</b> purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The justification for the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
50|$|From the {{earliest}} times, {{the portrayal of}} Benben was stylised in two ways; the first was as a pointed, pyramidal form, which <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> model for pyramids and obelisks. The other form was round-topped; this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> origin of Benben as a free standing votive object, and an object of veneration.|$|R

5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies {{are found}} on every {{continent}} except Antarctica. In {{contrast to the}} damselflies (Zygoptera), which tend to have restricted distributions, some genera and species are found across continents. For example, the blue-eyed darner Rhionaeschna multicolor is found all across North America, and in Central America; emperors Anax are found throughout the Americas from {{as far north as}} Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina, across Europe to central Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The globe skimmer Pantala flavescens <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most widespread dragonfly species in the world; it is cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents in the warmer regions. Most Anisoptera species are tropical, with far fewer species in temperate regions.|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E
