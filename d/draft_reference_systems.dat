40|$|Abstract. The paper {{starts with}} a short {{presentation}} of the conceptual foundations of celestial <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> and of the IAU decisions taken in 1991. The necessity to de ne and use them in the frameworkofGeneral Relativity induces some di culties that are analyzed.

40|$|The {{free energy}} of a {{molecular}} system can, at least in principle, be computed by thermodynamic perturbation from a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> whose free energy is known. The convergence of such a calculation depends critically on the conformational overlap between the reference and the physical systems. One approach to defining a suitable <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is to construct it from the one-dimensional marginal probability distribution functions (PDFs) of internal coordinates observed in a molecular simulation. However, the conformational overlap of this <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> tends to decline steeply with increasing dimensionality, due {{to the neglect of}} correlations among the coordinates. Here, we test a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> that can account for pairwise correlations among the internal coordinates, as captured by their two-dimensional marginal PDFs derived from a molecular simulation. Incorporating pairwise correlations in the <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> is found to dramatically improve the convergence of the free energy estimates relative to the first-order <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> due to increased conformational overlap with the physical distribution...|$|R

The experiments manipulated the number of views that observers were allowed to experience, {{the presence or absence of}} local and global <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g., a rectangular mat on which objects were placed and the walls of the room, respectively), and the congruence of local and global <b>reference</b> <b>systems.</b> Judgments of relative direction were more accurate for imagined headings parallel to study views than for imagined headings parallel to novel views, even with up to three study views.
