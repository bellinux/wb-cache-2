5000|$|The {{summer of}} 2003 saw Bradley Manor haul {{a number of}} trains in August under the name Torbay Express. Promoted by Past-Time Rail, the {{itinerary}} was Bristol Temple Meads to Kingswear and return. The originally planned four trains were so popular a fifth was added in September. Bradley Manor developed a <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> on the first run on 10 August and so was unable to haul the next two outings which saw 5051 Earl Bathurst step in. However Bradley Manor returned for the 31 August and 7 September trips. On commenting about {{the success of the}} Torbay Express, Past-Time Rail director Andy Staite said that [...] "Bradley Manor was the 'right' motive power for the line - Newton Abbot shed had 'Manors' in steam days and they were a familiar sight on the South Devon Coast route." ...|$|E
50|$|At 20:30 the {{previous}} evening the Galicia mail express, consisting of 12 carriages hauled by two 4-8-0 ‘Mastodon’ steam locomotives, left Madrid bound for A Coruña. It was running two hours late when it arrived at Astorga and was having problems with its brakes; nine minutes were spent at Astorga checking them. Later, one of the locomotives was removed due to a <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> The train was now three hours late, and despite serious problems with its brakes during the steep descent through Branuelas, {{the decision was made}} to continue. The train was scheduled to stop at Albares but failed to do so, despite all hand-brakes on the carriages and sand being applied. The Albares station master immediately telephoned Torre del Bierzo to say that the train had lost its brakes on the steep descent. At Torre del Bierzo the station master ran for his office and attempts were made to put sleepers on the line to slow the runaway train, but these efforts were to no avail and the train ran through with its whistle blowing incessantly and its brake shoes applied, heading for tunnel No 20, located just beyond the station.|$|E
50|$|However, despite more {{consideration}} {{over the}} failings {{of his previous}} designs, the class was still plagued by the liabilities of heavy coal and water consumption combined with the serious ongoing ailment of <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> that afflicted all his previous 4-6-0s.|$|R
50|$|Although powerful, {{the class}} was not without its problems. The frames, lightly {{constructed}} to avoid excessive axle load, {{were not able to}} handle the power of the cylinders and flexing of the frame under load led to problems such as <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b> The class also suffered from leaking boiler tubes after passing over points, which necessitated structural reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|The Midland was {{grouped into}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. On {{locomotive}} affairs, Anderson and Fowler {{were able to}} influence the LMS to follow Midland practice rather {{than that of the}} London and North Western Railway (LNWR). This included the use of standard small axle bearings and short travel valves that resulted in <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> and inefficiency respectively.|$|R
50|$|They were {{introduced}} for the accelerated Dublin - Belfast schedule, {{on which they}} reduced running times by up to 22 minutes. However, as for the S Class before them, the demanding timetable resulted in severe maintenance problems: <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> connecting rod problems and boiler re-tubes. As a result, the boiler pressure was reduced by 50 lbf/in2, reducing tractive effort by 20%.|$|R
50|$|The T14 s {{were the}} most {{successful}} of Drummond's abysmal 4-6-0 designs for the LSWR, though they still displayed the old, costly liabilities of heavy coal and water consumption on a railway that did not employ water troughs, which was combined with a high frequency of <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b> Both were complaints that had afflicted all his previous 4-6-0s, and did not endear them to locomotive crews.|$|R
50|$|Along with Anderson, Fowler was {{responsible}} for the adoption by the LMS of the Midland's small engine policy. Various Midland standard types were built by the LMS, including the 4P Midland Compound 4-4-0, the 2P 4-4-0, the 4F 0-6-0, and the 3F 0-6-0T. The small engine policy resulted in frequent double-heading, as the locomotives were not powerful enough to cope with loads, and thus increased expense. Standardisation also left these standard locomotives with short-travel valves and small <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> the former leading to inefficiency and the latter to frequent <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{they were}} {{powerful}} machines, the 5600s were very unpopular with footplate crews at the time. They were beset by numerous failures, {{the most common}} of which was <b>hot</b> <b>axle</b> <b>boxes.</b> They lacked the wider tolerances in their boxes that the original Welsh company locomotives had. They also had the tendency to derail, so those driving them preferred them in reverse, where the pony truck was able to guide them around tight curves. When the Welsh railwaymen discovered that the new GWR 5700 Class 0-6-0 pannier tank (introduced 1929) was even more suitable for the same work - being shorter and lighter, with roughly the same (slightly lower) tractive effort - no further Class 56xx/66xx locos were built.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{instrumentation}} for detection of rail defects, in particular rail top defects, in a railway-track by measuring an <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal of a rail vehicle, wherein a longitudinal <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal {{is used as}} a measure to detect the occurrence of said rail defects, in particular rail top defects. The method also includes measuring a vertical <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal of said rail vehicle, whereby the longitudinal <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal is used in combination and simultaneously with said vertical <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal. It is further preferred that the longitudinal <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal is used to remove from said vertical <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signal a signal-part that relates to vibrations of the rail vehicle's wheelset, including the bearing and <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> (3), and that the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration signals are filtered for removing signal-parts contributed by vibrations of the track, including the rail (1), rail pads, fasteners, sleepers, and ballast.

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and the piston (<b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide). <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> springs are placed on the lower spring seat placed on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower spring seat for cushioning effect. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The end portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves in the lower spring seat filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> housing increased. The reason was the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> spring seating. They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} spring seating due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide moves down. The downward movement of the <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R
40|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>boxes</b> (Fig. 1) {{support the}} weight of the car while {{rotating}} the axles. On occasion, problems such as foreign substances in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> cause abnormal heating, and may be a cause of critical accidents such as derailment. We currently check abnormal heating of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> by visual inspection using thermo-labels (Fig. 2) attached {{to the end of the}} axle that change color when temperature rises. But, with the current method, we can check such heating only after the train enters locations such as the vehicle maintenance depot. We thus studied the possibility of more frequent temperature checking system for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> heating while the train is running to reduce the risk of critical accidents. We thus started developing a system which detects the running <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> heating from the wayside precisely by using temperature sensors. This system monitors temperature of the <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of passing trains, immediately informing the vehicle maintenance depot and the dispatcher’s office of any abnormal heating detected...|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the <b>axle.</b> The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. <b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> grease is filled in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing. Each <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> is placed on a housing which closes the <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> seating area. the lower spring seat sits on the washers. The lower spring seat is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of spring seat, a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower spring seat {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide is welded to the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide works as a piston in the Lower spring seat filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R
40|$|Rail welds {{are widely}} used in {{high-speed}} railways and short-wave irregularities usually appear due to limitations in welding technology. These irregularities can excite a high wheel/rail force and are regarded as {{the main cause of}} deterioration in track structures. To measure this fierce force (or deterioration of the rail weld), <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration is treated as an effective and economic measure, though an exact quantitative relation between these two quantities remains elusive. This paper aims to develop such a relation in order to provide a new theoretical basis and an analysis method for monitoring and controlling weld geometry irregularity. To better understand the characteristics of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, the paper consists of two parts: an observation and a numerical simulation of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration by rail welds. Based on measured data from field tests, <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration at rail welds was found to have high-frequency vibrations in two frequency bands (i. e., 350 – 500 Hz and 1000 – 1200 Hz). Upon analyzing the vibration characteristics in time–frequency domains, the exact location of the rail weld irregularity could be identified. Subsequently, a 3 D high-speed wheel/rail rolling contact finite element model was employed to investigate the effect of rail weld geometry on <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, and led to the discovery that the weld length and depth determine the vibration frequency and amplitude of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration, respectively. A quantitative relation between <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> acceleration and wheel/rail force has also been determined. Finally, we propose an approach for real-time health detection of rail welds and discuss the influence of other defects and rail welds on the acceleration signal of the <b>axle</b> <b>box...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Class GL had {{a rocking}} grate and {{self-cleaning}} hopper ashpan {{with water and}} steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> motion areas and other friction-sensitive places.

5000|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>box</b> {{suspensions}} absorb shocks {{between the}} axle bearings and the bogie frame. The <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> suspension usually {{consists of a}} spring between the bogie frame and axle bearings to permit up-and-down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottom of}} the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide has a guide cap with {{perforations}} so that during the downward movement of the axle guide in the lower spring seat, the oil in the dashpot rushes in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> guide.

50|$|The {{coupled axles}} had {{overhung}} springing using leaf springs. An equalising beam, {{level with the}} <b>axle</b> <b>boxes,</b> linked the two springs.

40|$|Failure of {{the train}} <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing will cause great loss. Now, {{condition-based}} maintenance of train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing has been a research hotspot around the world. Vibration signals generated by train <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing have nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. The methods used in traditional bearing fault diagnosis do not work well with the train <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> To solve this problem, an effective method of <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing fault diagnosis based on multifeature parameters is presented in this paper. This method {{can be divided into}} three parts, namely, weak fault signal extraction, feature extraction, and fault recognition. In the first part, a db 4 wavelet is employed for denoising the original signals from the vibration sensors. In the second part, five time-domain parameters, five IMF energy-torque features, and two amplitude-ratio features are extracted. The latter seven frequency domain features are calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition and envelope spectrum analysis. In the third part, a fault classifier based on BP neural network is designed for automatic fault pattern recognition. A series of tests are carried out to verify the proposed method, which show that the accuracy is above 90 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this study, we {{verified}} {{the applicability}} of the energy harvesting technology to the railroad system for real-time wireless sensor networks. The origin of the power for this technology is found in the concept of energy harvesting, which resources thermal deviation occurring when a train runs. For this, we measured the temperature generated on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing from the train’s running environment by using a high-speed train, analyzed the thermal deviation and calculated the estimated energy harvesting power for the sensor network of the railroad system. The thermal deviation occurred in the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing when a train runs; the deviation was approximately 12. 97 ∼ 14. 68 ℃. We calculated in the assumption of the basic thermo element of the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing area, which is the area of the temperature sensor attached on the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> bearing. Theoretically, the energy harvesting power of 63. 8 mW can be obtained and thus by using the energy harvesting power {{it will be possible to}} operate the wireless sensor network for railroad monitoring...|$|R

Early detection of abnormality of bearings is needed in regions with heavy snowfall too, so we examined functions for cold and snow resistance to apply the system for the greater Tokyo area to cold regions. We installed a prototype system that reflected the examination results at Ugo-Ushijima Station on the Uetsu Line (in Akita City) in the period from December 2010 to September 2011. Using that, we investigated the effects low temperature, snow cover, and snowfall have on performance. Development for System for Cold Regions 2 The developed system measures temperature of components of an <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> that holds bearings. Specifically, it is a system using contactless infrared temperature sensors (infrared radiation thermometers) installed facing <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> of running train cars as shown in Fig. 1. The system measures surface temperature of <b>axle</b> <b>boxes</b> obliquely from below, and it gives an alert if it detects that a designated temperature is exceeded. Wheel detectors that are installed on the rail determine the position of each <b>axle</b> <b>box.</b> By using three wheel detectors on each side, velocity of passing trains is calculated to identify {{the position of the}} axles. The system has a built-in heater to keep ambient temperature at 5 ºC or higher for stable operation of temperature sensors. As the sensors are an infrared type, there should be no obstacles between the system and the <b>axle</b> <b>box</b> to be measured. Furthermore, to apply the current system to cold regions, cold and snow resistance has to be enhanced. Taking into account those conditions and installation to lines along the coast of the Japan Sea (Uetsu Line and Ou Line), we set the following specification values for cold regions based on weather data in the previous five years at Niitsu, Akita, Odate and Hirosaki...|$|R
