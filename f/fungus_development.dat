40|$|Green {{bell peppers}} (Capsicum annuum cv. Cardio) were stored in open crates at 5 degreesC, using a novel system for {{maintenance}} of relative humidity (RH). A hollow fiber membrane contactor allowed adequate transfer of water vapor between {{the air in}} the storage room and a liquid desiccant. The membrane was made of polyetherimide (PEI), coated on the inside with a thin non-porous silicone layer. The desiccant was a dilute aqueous glycerol solution, which was pumped through the hollow fibers at a low flow rate. Produce was placed in ventilated 5001 containers with a closed lid. During the 3 weeks of the experiment, RH could be maintained within a narrow range each day (e. g. 90. 5 +/- 0. 1 %). RH could be changed by adjusting the glycerol concentration and/or the temperature of the desiccant. The control was a 5501 container connected to the hollow fiber membrane set up which had no glycerol solution (average RH 93 %). The contactor thus removed water vapor in this set up. The quality of the bell peppers (visible peel shrivelling and <b>fungus</b> <b>development),</b> after 3 weeks of storage, was highly dependent on RH. Compared with the control container and with packaging in conventional cardboard boxes for bell peppers (average RH 86 %), the contactor system reduced <b>fungus</b> <b>development</b> without increasing shrivelling. The improvement compared with cardboard boxes was presumably due to reduction of local differences in RH. Such differences were avoided in the containers where the packaging was very open (open crates, with space in between them, and only two layers of fruit) and where the airflow was rather high. In preliminary experiments with red currants and pears the contactor system also functioned well (a) at subzero temperatures, (b) when it was combined with controlled atmosphere (7. 5 % oxygen and 20 % carbon dioxide), or (c) when it released water vapor.

We have studied early events that occur after the infection and show here that a tobacco gene encoding the extracellular S-like RNase NE is expressed in response to inoculation with the pathogenic fungus. Upon induction of SAR with cryptogein, the accumulation of NE transcripts coincided with a rapid induction of RNase activity and with the increase in the activity of at least two different extracellular RNases.

40|$|During {{filamentous}} <b>fungus</b> <b>development,</b> multinucleated hyphae {{employ a}} system for long-range nuclear migration to maintain an equal nuclear density. A decade ago the microtubule motor dynein was shown to {{play a central role}} in this process. Previous studies with Ashbya gossypii revealed extensive bidirectional movements and bypassings of nuclei, an autonomous cytoplasmic microtubule (cMT) cytoskeleton emanating from each nucleus, and pulling of nuclei by sliding of cMTs along the cortex. Here, we show that dynein is the sole motor for bidirectional movements and bypassing because these movements are concomitantly decreased in mutants carrying truncations of the dynein heavy-chain DYN 1 promoter. The dynactin component Jnm 1, the accessory proteins Dyn 2 and Ndl 1, and the potential dynein cortical anchor Num 1 are also involved in the dynamic distribution of nuclei. In their absence, nuclei aggregate to different degrees, whereby the mutants with dense nuclear clusters grow extremely long cMTs. As in budding yeast, we found that dynein is delivered to cMT plus ends, and its activity or processivity is probably controlled by dynactin and Num 1. Together with its role in powering nuclear movements, we propose that dynein also plays (directly or indirectly) a role in the control of cMT length. Those combined dynein actions prevent nuclear clustering in A. gossypii and thus reveal a novel cellular role for dynein...|$|E
40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic compounds, {{produced}} by fungi and {{recognized as the}} main cause of chronic intoxications in the world. Maize is one of the crops subjected to the most critical mycotoxin problems throughout the world. Limitations set by the European Commission and by other nations of the world on the maximum levels of mycotoxins in cereal grain have had an important socio-economic impact on the global cereal market. As a consequence, producing maize grain with acceptable mycotoxin content and simultaneously maintaining profitability has become more and more difficult, with important socio-economic consequences. Mycotoxin contamination in maize grain {{is the result of a}} complex plant pathosystem (a system defined by parasitism and in which a plant is the host) formed by maize plants, toxigenic fungi and insect borers. <b>Fungi</b> <b>development</b> and mycotoxin synthesis is influenced by climatic conditions and by the fungi competitive relationships, which determine their prevalent geographical distribution. As a consequence, warming of the climate system could have an important impact on the pathosystem and the potential effects are very difficult to foresee. The modelling of mycotoxin contamination in maize grain during the field phase represents a great opportunity for maize producers, policy makers, and for scientists, to manage the mycotoxin problem in maize and to study the pathosystem and the effects of climate change. The project MIMYCS (Maize Infection and MYcotoxin Contamination Simulator) have started in 2010 and aims at the development of a simulation model system to simulate the complex pathosystem which leads to mycotoxin contamination in maize grain. The project aims at providing a first operational tool to simulate at EU scale mycotoxin contamination in maize grain in different climatic, environmental and agro-management situations. In this context, the development of MIMYCS will allow an easy re-use of it for performing simulations (i) to inform European policy makers involved in food and feed safety of the effects of European mycotoxin policies and help them to fix safe and, at the same time, feasible contamination limits, (ii) to assess about climate change scenario effects on the pathosystem and on future maize-based food and feed products safety, (iii) to assist maize producers in controlling mycotoxin contamination through agro-management and improving maize grain safety. The MIMYCS model has been implemented as a component of the framework BioMA ([URL] the modelling platform used at the European Commission Joint Research Centre. MIMYCS has been developed as composed by three main model components: MIMYCS. Maize, MIMYCS. Borers, MIMYCS. Fungi. MIMYCS. Maize simulates maize phenological development and it implements the impact of the insect borer damage to the ears, fungi infection and mycotoxin accumulation in maize grain. MIMYCS. Borers simulate two maize borers (Ostrinia nubilalis and Sesamia nonagrioides) development and feeding activity which produces the damage to the ear, enhancing <b>fungi</b> growth and <b>development.</b> MIMYCS. <b>Fungi</b> simulates <b>fungi</b> <b>development</b> and their interactions, using information received from Maize and the Borers modules. Finally, the MIMYCS simulation system, will quantify mycotoxin contamination in maize grain, insect borers damage and fungi infection. The project has been developed in two years and it is funded by Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowships of the European Commission. The poster presentation will present the preliminary results of the project. JRC. H. 4 -Monitoring Agricultural Resource...|$|R
40|$|Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi represent {{two main}} groups of beneficial microorganisms of the rhizosphere. The role of different strains of Azospirillum on AM <b>fungi</b> <b>development</b> was evaluated {{by measuring the}} percentage of AM colonisation of the root system in durum wheat and maize plants, grown under both greenhouse and field conditions. The effect of wild type A. brasilense strain Sp 245 and genetically-modified derivatives overproducing indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) was assessed at greenhouse level in (a) three different cultivars of durum wheat, in presence of indigenous AM fungi, and (b) maize plants artificially inoculated with Glomus mosseae and G. macrocarpum. Additionally, the establishment of natural AM fungal symbiosis was evaluated using A. lipoferum CRT 1 in maize plants, at field level. Despite the stimulatory effect of the different Azospirillum inocula on root growth, {{no significant differences in}} AM colonisation were found, independently of the AM fungus involved, either in wheat or maize plants. Similarly, genetically-modified A. brasilense, which strongly stimulates root development did not affect AM formation. Although these results were obtained in conditions in which the mycorrhization rate was moderate (15 - 30 %), overall considered they indicate that the use of wild-type or genetically-modified Azospirillum phytostimulators does not alter mycorrhization...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of potassium sorbate (K-sorb) as an antifungal, alone or combined with thiabendazole (TBZ), and hot water at 53 °C, was studied against blue mold on apples. Results demonstrated the fungistatic effect of K-sorb: 2000 mgL - 1 significantly reduced Penicillium expansum growth, and a 24 h delay in <b>fungi</b> <b>development</b> {{was observed in}} the amended liquid culture. K-sorb at 1 % significantly diminished decay incidence, especially when applied at 53 °C. The performance of TBZ was not improved by the co-application of K-sorb. Treatments efficacy was related to K-sorb distribution on fruit surface. ESEM and X-ray qualitative spectra analyses revealed an irregular distribution of K-sorb over the fruit surface and areas with salt accumulation. K-sorb residues remained quite unchanged until 3 d of storage then they declined progressively. Their degradation was influenced by water temperature: it was faster on fruit treated at 53 °C. An inverse relation between P. expansum growth and K-sorb concentration was observed. After 72 h of incubation, P. expansum depleted 99 % of K-sorb from liquid culture media. The low {{efficacy of}} K-sorb treatments against blue mold decay on apple fruit may be ascribed to the low persistence of K-sorb residues, to the irregular spatial distribution of the salt on the fruit surface, {{and the ability of}} P. expansum to degrade the sal...|$|R
