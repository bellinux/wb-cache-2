Tibbets selected Wendover for its remoteness.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{knew of the}} {{technique}} of distillation, {{but it was not}} practiced on a major scale in Europe until some time around the 12th century, when Arabic innovations in the field combined with water-cooled glass alembics were introduced. Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce the essence of the liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E

25|$|Kary Mullis {{conceived}} PCR in 1985 as an {{in vitro}} simplified {{reproduction of the}} in vivo process of DNA replication. Taking advantage of the chemical properties of DNA {{and the availability of}} thermostable DNA polymerases, PCR allows for the enrichment of a DNA sample for a certain sequence. PCR provides the possibility to obtain a large quantity of copies of a particular stretch of the genome, making further analysis possible. It is a highly sensitive and specific technology, which makes it suitable <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> genetic diagnosis, including PGD. Currently, many different variations exist on the PCR itself, {{as well as on the}} different methods for the posterior analysis of the PCR products.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{trials are}} a means {{through which the}} {{healthcare}} industry tests a new drug, treatment, or medical device.

The U.S. government has an established network for tackling {{the emergence of new}} products in the healthcare industry. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not conduct trials on new drugs coming from pharmaceutical companies. Along with the FDA, the National Institutes of Health sets the guidelines <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> clinical trials relating to infectious diseases.

25|$|Biggs was {{nominated}} {{to run for}} Governor in 1886, and fortunately for him, {{it was the last}} year such a disparity existed between the parties. For the last time there was no Republicans candidate, and he received only the token opposition of the Temperance Reform Party candidate, James R. Hoffecker, whom he defeated easily. Biggs served from January 18, 1887 until January 20, 1891. Two years later the Republicans began their long road back and took advantage of splits in the Democratic leadership to elect a small majority in the State House. Meanwhile, Biggs did as countless governors before him, and pleaded with the General Assembly <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> reform, including better representation for New Castle County, and reform of the voting procedures.

25|$|In 1980, the Authority {{standardised}} the Urdu {{keyboard layout}} for typewriters based on Naskh script. Later on, {{with the arrival}} of the digital age, the layout was improved for teleprinters and Information processing. Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of Urdu Zabta Takhti (اردو ضابطہ تختی) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as Computerised National Identity Cards by NADRA and a number of E-Governance initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> electronic computing, communications, and storage. Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode.

25|$|In {{advance of}} {{becoming}} {{president of the}} Society of Authors in August 2013, Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans. Under arrangements in force at the time, authors were paid 6p per library loan by the government for physical books, but nothing for ebook loans. In addition, the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans. Altogether, this may have resulted in authors losing up to two-thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book. Addressing this issue, Pullman said: New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work. Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, {{and needs to be}} changed. That is our whole argument.|$|E
