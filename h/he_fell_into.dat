5|$|Several {{video game}} {{publications}} have provided praise and criticism on Alucard's character. In Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow, where Alucard was present as Genya Arikado, reviewers noted that although <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a stereotypical character mold, the greater concentration on supporting characters was a welcomed change from previous Castlevania games.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} {{the first of}} what was to become a lifelong series of bouts of insanity in 1392 when, on a hot August day outside Le Mans, he attacked his household knights, including his brother Orléans, killing four men. After the attack <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma that lasted four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of his illness and quickly seized power, re-establishing themselves as regents and dissolving the Marmouset council.|$|E
5|$|Chip Diller – Landis {{receives}} {{a letter from}} Diller, who is currently serving as a missionary in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as {{his father was a}} prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian and fell into his current profession as minister and missionary.|$|E

5|$|On 11 January 1941, Joyce {{underwent}} surgery in Zurich for a perforated ulcer. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma the following day. He awoke at 2a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse {{to call his}} wife and son, before losing consciousness again. They were still en route when he died 15minutes later, {{less than a month}} short of his 59th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury made it impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|Daghlian was {{estimated}} to have received a dose of 510rem (5.1Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and sister were flown out to care for him (his father had died in 1943). <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma, and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a criticality accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E
6000|$|... "'San infern'l shame," [...] said he indignantly. [...] "I'll no forgerrit when I... {{meet the}} French." [...] Then <b>he</b> too <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> reflection.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{finding his}} {{companion}} still mute, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> himself <b>into</b> a smiling and motionless meditation, {{at the end}} of which he said suddenly: ...|$|R

5|$|In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The {{following}} year William Wallace and Andrew Murrey raised forces {{to resist the}} occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Murrey died of wounds after the battle and {{for a short time}} Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the English, who executed him for treason {{despite the fact that he}} owed no allegiance to England.|$|E
5|$|It {{is written}} in the same style as the Tory {{publications}} that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about {{the handling of the}} issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for seditious libel. His imprisonment, during which <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
60|$|With that, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> {{his place}} beside Barnaby; {{and when the}} {{secretary}} looked after him, both {{were lost in the}} crowd.|$|R
60|$|His words, however, were arrested, for at {{the moment}} another arrow struck him in the throat, and <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> the arms of those around him.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who {{has been}} nursing Mark (Paul Schneider) at the {{hospital}} since <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the pit, says he has acted much nicer since the incident. Ann also reveals she has broken up with Andy (Chris Pratt). Mark and Leslie kissed before he fell, but both insist they are just friends. Mark tries to ask Ann out, but she declines {{out of respect for}} Leslie's friendship. Meanwhile, the Bulge holds a party in Leslie's honor, which she attends along with Tom (Aziz Ansari) to announce she has not taken a political stand. However, she accepts the free drinks they offer her and ends up getting drunk and having a great time. The next day, she is invited to go on the Pawnee Today talk show to discuss her supposed stance on same-sex marriage with Marcia Langman and television host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins).|$|E
5|$|Edward speculated {{heavily in}} real estate, and {{gradually}} lost the family's {{wealth in the}} depression that followed the Panic of 1873. When Louis was seven, the family lost their home, moving to Saratoga, New York, with help from Eliza's family. Edward's health collapsed, but he nonetheless {{took a job as}} a reporter for a Saratoga newspaper, later purchasing a small Democratic paper of his own, The Saratoga Sun. Louis's health, in contrast, improved during his teenage years, allowing him to leave the house more often and consider attending Yale University. On his way to a cousin's wedding rehearsal, he suffered a bicycle accident in which <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> gravel, permanently scarring his face. Ultimately, the dual obstacles of his still-questionable health and finances caused him to abandon his university ambitions and instead take a job with his father's paper.|$|E
60|$|The Professor pushed past. He, too, {{looked around}} the room, and gazed at the two bodies with an {{expression}} of blank and absolute terror. Then <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> Craig's arms.|$|R
60|$|The {{king was}} still cheerfully talkative and abounded in ideas. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> {{presently}} <b>into</b> an amiable controversy with the American, {{who seemed to}} feel a lack of impressiveness in the occasion.|$|R
60|$|He blushed like a school-girl, and strenuously {{protested that}} it was not so. In his haste <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> headlong <b>into</b> the sin of hastiness--as was but natural--and said perhaps too much.|$|R
5|$|While {{he agreed}} to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro, Himmler did this by {{transferring}} him to Berlin and appointing him as Generalinspekteur der Gendarmerie und Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden (General Inspector of the Gendarmerie and Schutzpolizei in the Reich) {{with the intention of}} establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. Nothing is known about Meyszner's activities in this role. At the end of the war, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the Western Allies and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators. He was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality, Robert H. Jackson, in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after. His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the Wehrmacht, and the publication of his name along with lists of those executed, meant that his fate was certain.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner's time in Belgrade was characterised by {{friction}} and competition with German military, economic and foreign affairs officials, {{and by his}} visceral hatred and distrust of Serbs. During his tenure, he oversaw regular reprisal killings and sent {{tens of thousands of}} forced labourers to the Reich and occupied Norway. His Gestapo detachment used a gas van to kill as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children that had been detained at the Sajmište concentration camp. In April 1944, his outspoken complaints about a reduction in reprisals against civilians allowed his enemies within the German occupation regime in Serbia to have him removed. Himmler transferred him to Berlin with the task of establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. After the war, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the Allies and was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality. Extradited to Yugoslavia, he was tried for war crimes, along with many of his staff from his time in Serbia. He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed by hanging in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|The besiegers {{became aware}} of this, and, unlike the Byzantines, the Angevin commanders were eager for a decisive confrontation. At this point, Sully {{resolved}} to reconnoitre the area personally, accompanied only by a bodyguard of 25 men. As he approached the Byzantine camp, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> an ambush by Turkish mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army. The Turks attacked the small troop, killed Sully's horse, scattered his guard, and captured him. A few of Sully's guards escaped and reached their camp, where they reported his capture. Panic spread among the Angevin troops at this news, {{and they began to}} flee towards Valona. The Byzantines took advantage of their disordered flight and attacked, joined by the troops in the besieged citadel. Many Latins fell, many others were captured as the Byzantines aimed their arrows at the less well-protected horses of the Latin knights, unhorsing them. The Byzantines also took an enormous booty, including all the numerous siege machines. Only a small remnant managed to cross the river Vjosë and reach the safety of Kanina.|$|E
50|$|In late December 1960, Knorr, 47, died of burns {{suffered}} when <b>he</b> accidentally <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{a bathtub}} of scalding water while vacationing in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hotel. Upon his death, Fetzer became majority owner.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{went back}} into the forest a short {{distance}} until he had found a tree suited to his primitive requirements, and then, curling himself in a great crotch, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> immediately <b>into</b> a deep sleep.|$|R
60|$|After {{delivering}} {{himself of}} these remarks, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> again <b>into</b> his smiling train of reflection; {{from which he}} roused himself at length to finish his chocolate, which was getting cold, and ring the bell for more.|$|R
5|$|At 06:00, Howell, who was {{in charge}} of a post to the right of the line, noticed the {{battalion}} on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhusting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.|$|E
5|$|Despite this debacle, in {{the same}} summer he was {{entrusted}} with the post of magister militum for Thrace, and tasked with campaigning against the Avars {{at the head of}} an improvised force. His deputy (hypostrategos) Salvianus with 1,000 cavalry was sent to hold the passes of the Haemus Mountains, but after two days was forced by the Avars' numerical superiority to withdraw. The Avars sacked the city of Anchialos, but an attempted siege of Drizipera was broken off and the Avars marched south, reaching Heraclea Perinthus and cutting Priscus's forces off from Constantinople. Outflanked, Priscus retreated to Tzurullum, where he was besieged by the Avars. The 7th-century historian Theophylact Simocatta reports that after a few days, Priscus devised a stratagem to force the Avars to withdraw: he allowed one of his guards to be captured, bearing a fake letter purportedly coming from Maurice that informed Priscus of a seaborne attack against the Avars' homeland. The Avar khagan was persuaded that the letter was true and prepared to return home in haste; he arranged for a truce in exchange for the renewed payment of an annual tribute. The 12th-century history of Michael the Syrian gives this as 800 pounds of gold (some 60,000 solidi), a considerably reduced sum compared to the 100,000 solidi agreed in 584. The Avars departed for their country, while Priscus disbanded his army and returned to Constantinople. Priscus disappears for the next few years, as <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disfavour with Maurice. By 593, he had recovered his position, as a letter by Pope Gregory the Great which congratulates him on returning to the emperor's favour testifies. The Pope's letter also testifies that by this time, Priscus had been given the Empire's supreme honorary rank, that of patrikios.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} King Alexander III in 1286, {{and then of}} his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he {{extracted}} legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, {{the man with the}} strongest claim, who became king in 1292. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the Auld Alliance. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk. The English barons refuted the French-inspired papal claim to Scottish overlordship in the Barons' Letter, 1301, claiming it rather as long possessed by English kings. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the hands of the English, who executed him for treason {{despite the fact that he}} believed he owed no allegiance to England.|$|E
