40|$|To meet {{stringent}} vehicular emission norms worldwide, various {{exhaust treatment}} techniques have been employed in modern engines. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are formed during combustion inside cylinder {{which is responsible}} for major respiratory problems in human beings. NOx also contributes to global warming and acid rain formation. One of the techniques of reducing the oxides of nitrogen in the exhaust from the engine is to use <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation (EGR) technique. This paper presents a brief review on the effect of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation (EGR) on engine performances and exhaust emission characteristics of compression ignition engines based on the reports of different researchers available in the literature.

Reduction in <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> temperature, smoke <b>density</b> and NOx were observed but emissions of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon di oxide (CO 2) are increased with the increase in EGR percentage without any engine modification...|$|R

Individual cells alternately open and close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> side is reached, pressurized <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there.

Before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> can flow, the aperture is closed again and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> column is reflected before entering the engine. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|R
