40|$|Keywords-surface defect inspection; SWT; image fusion; image {{segmentation}} Abstract—Typical characteristics of web manufacturing process,when {{compared with other}} sheet or <b>flat</b> <b>product</b> manufacturing, are the large value of web width and production speed. So {{the development of new}} and efficient algorithm invokes the interests of many researchers. This paper describes a novel approach based on stationary wavelet transform for the segmentation of web surface defect. The segmentation is performed firstly by decomposing the gray level image into sub-band images and then by an image fusion scheme for the sub-images. Compared with orthogonal wavelet transform (OWT), the notable advantage of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is its shift invariance. These properties are especially important for defect detection. Image fusion makes full use of available information in each sub-band images to obtain better output results when compared with ordinary image enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of our method. The proposed method is targeted for web surface defect inspection but has the potential for broader application areas such as steel, wood and fabric defect detection. With the development of high performance signal processors, spectral analysis or a combination of statistical and spectral analysis would be the trend of web surface defect inspection...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSevere {{thin strip}} cold rolling {{conditions}} usually induce heterogeneity of in-bite plastic deformation always translated to irregular stress field. This stress field may dwell sufficiently compressive in several out-of-bite areas to cause buckling (flatness defects) which generates stress reorganisation in rolled strip and probably affects the bite zone. Hence, out-of-bite buckling, in-bite elastic-(visco) plastic deformation and thermo-mechanical roll-stack/strip interaction may be strongly coupled. However, a completely coupled model providing realistic rolled strip shape specially when flatness defects occur {{is not easy}} to establish. This call for two ways of flatness defect modelling in thin strip rolling: with a completely coupled approach but using a simple buckling criterion, or using an uncoupled approach by chaining strip rolling model calculation with shell element models presenting good buckling computing capabilities. Our objective is the improvement of the <b>flat</b> <b>product</b> rolling - specialized FEM software Lam 3 /Tec 3 [1] using Counhaye simple buckling criterion [3] and Asymptotic Numerical Method (ANM) for shell element model [9, 10] respectively with coupled and uncouple approaches detailed in the present paper.

40|$|One of {{the main}} factors having a {{significant}} effect on fuel and energy saving in the production of rolled ferrous metals is matching the operation of the continuous casting machines (CCM) with that of the reheating furnaces so called “continuous technologies ” in the form of “direct rolling ” or “hot charging”.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{design of}} a counter-current two-phase thermosyphon is investigated for the in-plane cooling of <b>flat</b> <b>product</b> structures. The thermosyphon features multiple pools staggered along the entire evaporator section, in which liquid flowing toward {{the bottom of the}} thermosyphon can be stored. The pools are used to cascade the working fluid to the evaporator end cap. Liquid accumulates in the pools until they overflow, thereby spreading the working fluid across the entire evaporator length rather than creating one liquid pool at the bottom end cap. Multiple of such thermosyphons operating in parallel can be used for low-gradient planar cooling of vertically oriented surfaces. A numerical model using a control volume approach is developed to predict and to validate the experimental results of this innovative design. The main advantages of the control volume approach are the adaptability of the entire model and the fast computational speed in comparison to elaborate fluid dynamics models. Empirical correlations are used for the modeling of the heat transfer coefficients and friction factors of the counter-current flow. A proof of principle is given by observing a prototype that was milled into a copper bar. Next to logging temperature measurements, the prototype had a glass top plate to visually record the working fluid behavior. The model presented is well suitable for the early stages of thermosyphon design studies and for the impact evaluation of design changes...|$|E
