40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} if (a) substituting total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts with standing or various types of physical activity and (b) substituting long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts; is associated with obesity indicators using a cross sectional isotemporal substitution approach among blue-collar workers. A total of 692 workers from transportation, manufacturing and cleaning sectors wore an Actigraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer on the thigh for 1 - 4 working days. The sedentary (sit and lie), standing, walking, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time on working days was computed using validated Acti 4 software. The total sedentary time and uninterrupted sedentary time spent in brief (≤ 5 mins), moderate (> 5 and ≤ 30 mins), and long (> 30 mins) bouts, were determined for the whole <b>day</b> and during <b>work</b> and non-work time separately. The obesity indicators, BMI (kg/m 2), waist circumference (cm) and fat percentage were objectively measured. Isotemporal substitution modelling was utilized to determine the linear association with obesity indicators of replacing 30 min of total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts with standing, walking or MVPA and separately replacing 30 min of long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts. Workers [mean (standard deviation, SD); age = 45. 1 (9. 9) years, BMI = 27. 5 (4. 9) kg/m 2, %BF = 29. 6 (9. 5), waist circumference = 94. 4 (13. 0) cm] sat for 2. 4 hours (~ 32 % of the measured time, SD = 1. 8 hours) across the <b>day</b> during <b>work</b> <b>period</b> and 5. 5 hours (~ 62 % of the measured time, SD = 1. 5 hours) during non-work period. Most of the sedentary time was accrued in moderate bouts [work = 1. 40 (SD = 1. 09) hours] during work and in long bouts during non-work [2. 7 (SD = 1. 4) hours], while least in long sedentary bouts during work [work = 0. 5 (SD = 0. 9) ] and in brief sedentary bouts [0. 5 hours (SD = 0. 3) ] during non-work. Significant associations with all obesity indicators were found when 30 min of total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts were replaced with standing time (~ 1 - 2 % lower) or MVPA (~ 4 - 9 % lower) during whole <b>day,</b> <b>work,</b> and non-work <b>periods.</b> The exception was that a statistically significant association was not observed with any obesity indicator when replacing total sedentary time or long sedentary bouts with standing time during the <b>work</b> <b>period.</b> Significant beneficial associations were found when replacing the long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts (~ 3 - 5 % lower) during all domains. Replacing total sedentary time and long sedentary bouts, respectively, not only with MVPA but also standing time appears to be beneficially associated with obesity indicators among blue-collar workers. Additionally, replacing long sedentary bouts with brief sedentary bouts was also beneficially associated with obesity indicators. Studies using prospective design are needed to confirm the findings...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To see {{if there}} is any change in blood {{concentrations}} of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and fibrinogen during a working shift in tunnel construction workers. Methods: 12 Tunnel construction workers were followed up during a 24 hours period after returning from a 9 <b>day</b> <b>work</b> free <b>period.</b> The first blood sample was taken on Monday afternoon before starting the shift. Another was taken around midnight after 8 hours of work, and another the next afternoon after about 12 hours of rest. Exposure to respirable dust was measured by personal samplers. Results: The exposure of the workers to respirable dust, in terms of an 8 hour time weighted average, varied between 0. 3 and 1. 9 mg/m 3. For IL- 6, there was an increase in the median serum concentra-tion from 1. 14 ng/l before starting the shift to 4. 86 ng/l after 8 hours of work (p= 0. 002). For fibrino-gen, there was an increase in the median concentration from 3. 40 g/l before entering the shift to 3. 70 g/l 24 hours later (p= 0. 044). There was a positive correlation between values of IL- 6 {{at the end of the}} working shift and the fibrinogen concentrations the next afternoon (Pearson’s R= 0. 73, p= 0. 007). The observed increase in IL- 6 was significant for both smokers and non-smokers.
