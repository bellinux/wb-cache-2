5|$|The Ottomans entered for {{the first}} time into Wallachia in 1395. Although the invading troops were {{defeated}} somewhere in a rovină ("ragged marshland") in Oltenia, the chaos created by the threat of attacks allowed a group of boyars to put Vlad I the Usurper (13951397) on the throne. Thus Mircea <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to take refuge in Transylvania, where he agreed to be Sigismund I of Hungary's vassal. He was restored to the throne and participated in the disastrous crusade of Nicopolis organized by Sigismund I.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy Dobruja in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again Dobruja and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E
5|$|In February 1921, Lemnos was {{stationed}} in Smyrna to support the occupation of the city. Operations {{came to a close}} in September 1922 when the Greek Army was forced to evacuate Smyrna by sea, along with a sizable number of civilians from Asia Minor. The fleet transported a total of 250,000 soldiers and civilians during the evacuation. Lemnos departed Smyrna on the evening of 8 September with her sister Kilkis. While en route from Smyrna to mainland Greece, Captain Dimitrios Fokas, the commander of Lemnos, formed a Revolutionary Committee with Nikolaos Plastiras and Stylianos Gonatas, two colonels who supported Venizelos, who had been ousted in 1920. The men launched the 11 September 1922 Revolution, and other vessels in the fleet mutinied in support of the coup. King Constantine <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to abdicate in favor of his son, George II.|$|E

5|$|Northern England was a {{focal point}} for {{fighting}} during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The border counties were invaded by Scotland in the Second Bishops' War, and at the 1640 Treaty of Ripon King Charles <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to temporarily cede Northumberland and County Durham to the Scots and pay to keep the Scottish armies there. To raise enough funds and ratify the final peace treaty, Charles had to call what became the Long Parliament, beginning the process that led to the First English Civil War. In 1641, the Long Parliament abolished the Council of the North for perceived abuses during the Personal Rule period. By the time war broke out in 1642, King Charles had moved his court to York, and Northern England was to become a major base of the Royalist forces until they were routed at the Battle of Marston Moor.|$|E
5|$|From its founding, the Antankarana Kingdom {{was ruled}} by an {{unbroken}} series of nobles of Andriantsirotso's line. He was succeeded by Lamboeny (1710–1790), then Tehimbola (1790–1802), Boanahajy (1802–1809) and Tsialana I (1809–1822). The Kingdom of Imerina rapidly expanded {{over the first}} several decades of the 19th century, launching regular military campaigns to bring coastal communities under Merina control. As the Merina neared the Antankarana homeland they established posts along major trade routes where taxes were charged to Antankarana and other merchants, establishing economic control over the territory; this was soon followed by the installation of Merina administrators to govern the territory. Tsialana <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to become a vassal of the Merina sovereign. From 1835 to 1837, his son and successor, King Tsimiaro I (1822–1882), made repeated attempts to expel the Merina from his territory, but was unsuccessful. The Merina backlash forced Tsimiaro to lead his people to refuge among the rocks of Ankarana in 1838 or 1837, where they lived for over a year. During this time the king was betrayed {{by one of his}} own people and the group was surrounded by Merina soldiers. According to oral history, the king prayed for God's help and swore that if they survived, the Antankarana would convert to Islam. Although many of his party were gunned down, the king and most of his subjects escaped to the island of Nosy Mitsio, where they converted; many others were drowned in the attempt to cross. The site of the crossing is most commonly believed to be the village of Ambavan'ankarana, which retains a sacred character and has become a site of pilgrimage and ritual commemoration of the exodus.|$|E
25|$|In the 1820s, Emperor Francis <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> {{to convene}} the Hungarian Diet, which inaugurated a Reform Period. Nevertheless, {{progress}} was slowed by the nobles who clung to their privileges (exemption from taxes, exclusive voting rights, etc.). Therefore, the achievements were mostly of a symbolic character, {{such as the}} progress of the Magyar language.|$|E

25|$|A momentous {{intensification}} {{of the search}} for allies in Central Europe occurred when the French ruler Francis I was defeated at the Battle of Pavia on February 24, 1525, by the troops of Emperor Charles V. After several months in prison, Francis <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to sign the humiliating Treaty of Madrid, through which he had to relinquish the Duchy of Burgundy and the Charolais to the Empire, renounce his Italian ambitions, and return his belongings and honours to the traitor Constable de Bourbon. This situation forced Francis I to find an ally against the powerful Habsburg Emperor, in the person of Suleiman the Magnificent.|$|E

Shamshi-Adad I placed his sons in key geographical locations and gave them responsibility to look over those areas. While he remained in Šubat-Enlil, his eldest son, Ishme-Dagan I was put on the throne of Ekallatum.|$|E
25|$|The war went {{badly for}} Greece, and the Turks made large gains. On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to abdicate {{and the new}} {{military}} government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others. The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed. Prince Andrew's life {{was believed to be}} in danger, and Alice was under surveillance. In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life. The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box. Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark.|$|E

25|$|The {{chronicle of}} Thietmar poses some {{problems}} of {{interpretation of the}} information regarding the attack of Margrave Gero on the Slavic tribes, {{as a result of}} which he purportedly subordinated to the authority of the Emperor Lusatia and the Selpuli (meaning the Słupian tribes) and also Mieszko with his subjects. According to the majority of modern historians, Thietmar made an error summarizing the chronicle of Widukind, placing the Gero raid there instead of the fighting that Mieszko conducted at that time against Wichmann the Younger. Other sources make no mention of such conquest and of putting the Polans state on the same footing with the Polabian Slavs. On the other hand, the supporters of the Gero's invasion theory believe that the Margrave did actually carry out a successful invasion, as a result of which Mieszko <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to pay tribute to the Emperor and also was compelled to adopt Catholicism through the German Church. The thesis that proposes the introduction of Catholicism {{as a result of this}} war finds no confirmation in German sources.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

Two charters show that Tancred styled himself [...] "prince of Antioch" [...] in 1108.

500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> to butcher it {{because we had a}} deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything.
