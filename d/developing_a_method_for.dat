2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Brosius became {{interested}} in a small brain-specific RNA that {{was thought to be}} a waste product of a mechanism orchestrating the expression of genes by RNA polymerase III transcription of identifier sequence (ID) repetitive elements, classified as SINEs, short interspersed repeats, located in the introns of brain-specific genes by making chromatin [...] accessible to RNA polymerase II. This attractive hypothesis was not tenable. Instead, the Brosius laboratory focused on this brain cytoplasmic BC1 RNA, cloned it as cDNA by <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>for</b> generating cDNA libraries based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, and isolated its single gene, which evolved from a retroposed copy of a transfer RNA (tRNAAla). It was shown that BC1 RNA is the source gene for ID repetitive elements in rodents, and his laboratory established that the dendritic localization of BC1 RNA in neurons co-localizes with numerous components of the translation machinery. Based on these findings, Brosius concluded as early as the eighties that: ...|$|E

50|$|Upon {{returning}} from his {{service to the}} US military, Guy was hired {{to work for the}} U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1946, Guy worked as a soil correlator for the Soil Conservation Service in Iowa, and in 1952 he was made Director of Soil Survey Investigations. As part of his duties, he traveled the world studying and describing soils for the U.S. government. While working for the USDA, Guy was tasked with <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>method</b> <b>for</b> classifying soils. He produced the 1st of seven iterations of what would eventually become a soil taxonomy system used worldwide. Creating a way to classify soils was important because soils are a valuable global resource that we needed to better understand in order to utilize and improve upon. Guy collaborated with European soil scientists in developing Soil Taxonomy. For this and other research publications, Guy received international recognition for his outstanding efforts in soil science.|$|E
