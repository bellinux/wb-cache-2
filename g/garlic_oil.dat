40|$|Fumigant {{toxicity}} of <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> alone and {{in combination with}} carbon dioxide (92 % CO₂) to adults and pupae of Tribolium confusum and Ephestia kuehniella at 24 h of exposure time was studied. Results indicated that adults of E. kuehniella were the most sensitive, since <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> alone resulted in their complete mortality at each concentration, whereas adults of T. confusum were the most tolerant with LC₉₀ value of 30 μL L⁻¹. In contrast to {{the results for the}} adults, pupae of T. confusum were more sensitive with LC₉₀ value of 11. 1 μL L⁻¹ than those of E. kuehniella with LC₉₀ value of 27. 4 μL L⁻¹. When 92 % CO₂ was combined with <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil,</b> the LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ values for adult of T. confusum and pupa of T. confusum and E. kuehniella were significantly reduced. Combination of <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> with 92 % CO₂ produced decrements in LC₉₀ value of E. kuehniella pupa from 27. 4 to 0. 95 μL L⁻¹, while it resulted in reduction in LC₉₀ value of T. confusum pupa from 11. 1 to 1. 0 μL L⁻¹. Combination of <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> with 92 % CO₂ also produced significant decrements in LC₉₀ value for adults of T. confusum (4. 9 -fold) compared with those exposed to <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> alone. These results indicated that 92 % CO₂ had a synergistic effect on {{toxicity of}} <b>garlic</b> essential <b>oil</b> to T. confusum and E. kuehniella.
