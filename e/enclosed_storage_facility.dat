[...] However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as wool, which rely on some amount of moisture {{to maintain their}} flexibility (Putnam and Finch). [...] Additionally, temperature {{and humidity}} should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile. [...] For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with monitoring equipment to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, <b>enclosed</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> and work areas.|$|R

With {{respect to the}} management of spent fuel {{it was decided to}} terminate transports to reprocessing plants by 2005 and to set up interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> on power plant sites. This paper gives an overview of the German concept for spent fuel management focused on the new on-site interim storage concept and the applied interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities.</b> Since {{the end of the year}} 1998, the utilities have applied for permission of on-site interim storage in 13 <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> and 5 <b>storage</b> areas; one application for the interim <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> Stade was withdrawn due to the planned final shut down of Stade nuclear power plant in autumn 2003. In 2001 and 2002, 3 on-site storage areas and 2 on-site <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> for spent fuel were licensed by the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS). A main task in 2002 and 2003 has been the examination of the safety and security of the planned interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> and the verification of the licensing prerequisites. In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, BfS has also examined the attack with a big passenger airplane. Up to now, these aircraft crash analyses have been performed for three on-site interim storage facilities; the fundamental results will be presented. It is the objective of BfS to conclude the licensing procedures for the applied on-site interim <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> in 2003.
