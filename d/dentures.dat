5|$|When a tooth is lost, <b>dentures,</b> bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. <b>Dentures</b> {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. <b>Dentures</b> may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of <b>dentures,</b> implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain <b>dentures</b> using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional <b>dentures.</b> Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E

Poor <b>denture</b> cleanliness can increase colonization of Candida albicans and cause inflammatory reaction of denture-bearing mucosa, i. e. <b>denture</b> stomatitis. Objective: To find out the effect of <b>denture</b> cleanliness level on <b>denture</b> stomatitis on maxillary denture-bearing mucosa {{in a group of}} removable <b>denture</b> wearers who received prosthodontic treatment at Poliklinik Gigi RSMH Palembang and to investigate the <b>denture</b> hygiene habits of removable <b>denture</b> wearers. Methods: Thirty subjects participated in this study. <b>Denture</b> cleanliness level was assessed with disclosing solution to disclose <b>denture</b> plaque on internal surface of maxillary <b>denture.</b> Cleanliness level was graded according to Budtz-Jorgensen. Intraoral examination was done to determine any visible signs of <b>denture</b> stomatitis. Data referring to <b>denture</b> hygiene habits of removable <b>denture</b> wearers was collected from interview using questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the Komolgorov-Smirnov test. Results: Result of the study showed that 40 % subjects had poor upper <b>denture</b> cleanliness. <b>Denture</b> stomatitis was observed on maxillary denture-bearing mucosa in 43. 3 % subjects. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that there was a significant effect of <b>denture</b> cleanliness level on <b>denture</b> stomatitis on maxillary denture-bearing mucosa (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Action {{mechanism}} and properties of <b>denture</b> adhesivesa A <b>denture</b> adhesive {{is not a}} glue;although,as the name says,it must have adhesive properties allowing it to adhere to both the <b>denture</b> surface and the tissues under the <b>denture.</b> The adhesive ingredints bond the <b>denture</b> and the tissue via physical and non-covalent chemical interactions. A <b>denture</b> adhesive must also have cohesive strength (internal stick). In other words, it must stay together (by forming a sticky mass) and resit oozing (solubilization) as it hydrates with saliva. <b>Denture</b> adhesive act at their best when they have an ideal balance between their adhesive and cohesive properties.

5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing <b>dentures,</b> then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E
40|$|Chronic atrophic {{candidiasis}} is the pathologic {{changes on}} the oral mucous of the <b>denture</b> wearers, accompanied with erythematous under the <b>denture,</b> usually asymptomatic and relates to the yeast of Candida. The irritation factors of chronic atrophic candidiasis are ill fitting <b>denture,</b> using the <b>denture</b> at night and bad oral hygiene. This is a case report of chronic atrophic candidiasis on patient using removable <b>denture</b> without systemic disease. The trigger factors were using <b>denture</b> at night, mistaken of cleaning the <b>denture</b> and dental calculus surround the artificial teeth of <b>denture.</b> Final diagnosis is based on anamnesis, clinical examination and microbiology examination. Therapy given was a topical antifungal applied continuously for 7 days after the clinical signs dissapear. The patient was suggested to not using the <b>denture</b> at night, maintain the cleanliness of the <b>denture</b> regularly and scaling the teeth.

5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel <b>dentures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Pinner, Middlesex on 4 March 1923 to Capt. Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore MC (died 1947) and Gertrude (nÃ©e White) (died 1981). His family moved to Bognor Regis, and {{subsequently}} to East Grinstead where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by heart problems, which left him in poor health and he was educated at home by private tutors. He developed an interest in astronomy {{at the age of}} six and joined the British Astronomical Association at the age of eleven. He was invited to run a small observatory in East Grinstead at the age of 14, after his mentor â€“ who ran the observatory â€“ was killed in a road accident. At the age of 16 he began wearing a monocle after an oculist told him his right eye was weaker than his left. Three years later, he began wearing a full set of <b>dentures.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dentures</b> {{that fit}} well {{during the first}} few years after {{creation}} will not necessarily fit well {{for the rest of the}} wearer's lifetime. This is because the bone and mucosa of the mouth are living tissues, which are dynamic over decades. Bone remodeling never stops in living bone. Edentulous jaw ridges tend to resorb progressively over the years, especially the alveolar ridge of the lower jaw. Mucosa reacts to being chronically rubbed by the <b>dentures.</b> Poorly fitting <b>dentures</b> hasten both of those processes compared to the rates with well-fitting <b>dentures.</b> Poor fitting <b>dentures</b> may also lead to the development of conditions such as epulis fissuratum.|$|E

The present study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of oral candidiasis in patients using complete <b>denture</b> with different datas. 50 subjects all wearing complete <b>denture</b> participated in this study. The palatal mucosa was swabbed and swabs were cultured in Sabourauds medium containing 0. 005 % chloramphenicol then cultures were tested with common mycological lab tests. In 80 % of patients oral candidiasis have been diagnosed. In the investigation a direct relation between the oral candidiasis and removal of <b>denture</b> at night, <b>denture</b> cleanliness, presence of any suction and symptoms of <b>denture</b> stomatitis was shown. No relation between the oral candidiasis and sex, smoking habit, succeptible disease, angular cheilitis; the recent condition of <b>denture</b> and the retention of <b>denture</b> were found.

40|$|Introduction: Detachment of <b>denture</b> teeth from <b>denture</b> base {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for costly <b>denture</b> repairs. This study aimed at {{evaluating}} the bond strength of an acrylic <b>denture</b> tooth to polyamide injection-molded thermoplastic <b>denture</b> base material compared with three conventional polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) <b>denture</b> base resins. Materials and Method: A total of 40 acrylic <b>denture</b> molar teeth were randomly allocated into four groups (n= 10) of heat-polymerized (HP), Auto-polymerized (AP), Injection molded (IM) and Polyamide thermoplastic (PT). All <b>denture</b> base/acrylic teeth combinations underwent 5000 thermal cycles (5 - 55 â—¦C). Samples were subjected to shear bond strength test by a universal testing machine with a 1 mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s tests(Î±= 0. 05). Results: Mean Â±SD of shear bond strength values were (MPa) 4. 82 Â± 1. 21, 4. 52 Â± 1. 67, 3. 7 Â± 0. 84 and 4. 13 Â± 2. 21 for groups HP, AP, IM and PT respectively. No significant difference was found among the experimental groups (P= 0. 429).

25|$|A {{low-cost}} denture {{starts at}} about $300â€“$500 per denture, or $600â€“$1,000 {{for a complete}} set of upper and lower <b>dentures.</b> These tend to be cold cured <b>dentures,</b> which are considered temporary because of the lower quality materials and streamlined processing methods used in their manufacture.

25|$|<b>Dentures</b> (also {{known as}} false teeth) are {{prosthetic}} devices constructed to replace missing teeth; they {{are supported by}} the surrounding soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity. Conventional <b>dentures</b> are removable (removable partial denture or complete denture). However, there are many denture designs, some which rely on bonding or clasping onto teeth or dental implants (fixed prosthodontics). There are two main categories of <b>dentures,</b> the distinction being whether {{they are used to}} replace missing teeth on the mandibular arch or on the maxillary arch.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{randomised}} {{clinical trial}} assessed how biofilm development and composition {{is affected by}} time and <b>denture</b> material type in <b>denture</b> wearers with and without <b>denture</b> stomatitis. MethodsSpecimens of acrylic resin (control) and <b>denture</b> liners (silicone-based or acrylic resin based, depending on the experimental phase) were inserted into the surface intaglio of 30 <b>denture</b> wearers. Biofilm was formed in two phases of 21 days, and counts of viable micro-organisms in the accumulating biofilm were determined after 7, 14 and 21 days of biofilm formation. Data were analysed by three-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test to assess differences among health condition (healthy or with <b>denture</b> stomatitis), materials and time point. ResultsNon-albicans Candida species counts were higher in diseased patients with silicone-based <b>denture</b> liners (p= 0. 01). <b>Denture</b> stomatitis patients showed higher mutans streptococci counts after 7 days (p= 0. 0041). ConclusionsLonger biofilm formation time periods {{did not result in}} differences on biofilm composition. The <b>denture</b> liners evaluated in this study accumulate greater amount of biofilm, and therefore their use should be carefully planned. Clinical significanceThe silicone-based <b>denture</b> liner tested should be used cautiously in patients with <b>denture</b> stomatitis as it showed increased non-albicans species counts, known to be difficult to treat...|$|R
40|$|Aim: A {{comparative}} study for plaque removing efficacy between toothpaste, liquid handwashing soap, and two chemical-soak <b>denture</b> cleansers (clinsodent <b>denture</b> cleansing powder and fittydent <b>denture</b> cleansing tablet). Materials and Methods: A total of 140 healthy complete <b>denture</b> patients were selected and checked for <b>denture</b> cleansing using toothpaste, liquid handwashing soap, and two chemical <b>denture</b> cleansers: Clinsodent powder and fittydent tablets. Cleansing with plain water was kept as control for twenty patients. Results: The {{data were analyzed}} using Wilcoxon signed ranks test for checking the efficacy. The Kruskalâ€“Wallis test was used for comparing the plaque removing efficacies of each <b>denture</b> cleanser used in the study. All four <b>denture</b> cleansers were significantly effective in removing plaque when compared with plain water, but {{there was no significant difference}} among them. Conclusions: There was no significant difference among action of four <b>denture</b> cleansers used in this study. Thus we can infer that patients can use liquid handwashing soap or commercial products to overcome disadvantages of toothpastes. Recommendation from the results of this study is the use of liquid handwashing soap for cleansing after every meal and soaking of the <b>denture</b> in commercial <b>denture</b> cleanser during the night...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the <b>denture</b> care practices, denture-related problems, and denture-related {{quality of life}} of elderly <b>denture</b> wearers in Hong Kong. Method: The study population was elders aged 60 or above, living in the community, had self-care ability, and no serious systemic diseases. Elders attending elderly social centres in different districts in Hong Kong were recruited and face-to-face interviews were conducted by three trained interviewers using a pilot-tested structured questionnaire. Result: 216 elders (45 men and 171 women) {{with a mean age of}} 77. 2 Â± 7. 6 years were interviewed in the survey. Most (54 %) of them had worn <b>denture</b> for more than 10 years, and most elders were satisfied with the <b>denture</b> they were wearing. The vast majority (92 %) wore <b>denture</b> to improve mastication; and among them, 71 % thought their <b>denture</b> was of great help. Over 85 % wore their <b>denture</b> for a whole day but removed it before sleep. Only 13 % had used <b>denture</b> adhesive and nearly half (45 %) of these elders found it not helpful. They usually used a toothbrush (70 %) and toothpaste (58 %) to clean their <b>denture.</b> Proportionally more female than male <b>denture</b> wearers cleaned their <b>denture</b> more than twice daily (50 % vs. 24 %, p< 0. 001). Half of the elders also used <b>denture</b> cleansing agent. Poor <b>denture</b> stability and compromised chewing ability were the two most common problems (around 55 %) which affected these elders. However, most of them either did not tackle the problem or just changed their diet. Two thirds or more (66 - 82 %) of the elderly reported no negative denture-related impacts on their quality of life. Conclusion: Most of the community-dwelling elderly <b>denture</b> wearers in Hong Kong are satisfied with their <b>denture</b> and their quality of life is seldom negatively affected by their <b>denture.</b> Their dental care practices are satisfactory but they should seek professional care when <b>denture</b> problems arise. published_or_final_versionCommunity DentistryMasterMaster of Science in Community Dentistr...|$|R
25|$|Cold cured or cold pour <b>dentures,</b> {{also known}} as {{temporary}} <b>dentures,</b> do not look very natural, are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of <b>dentures</b> are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials.

Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, <b>dentures</b> can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new <b>dentures.</b> Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E
