40|$|Abstract: The {{substantial}} {{reliance on}} local property tax revenues to finance school systems {{has led to}} significant funding disparities between property-rich and property-poor school districts. The recognition of these disparities has spawned decades of litigation in states whose constitutions guarantee a high-quality education. Legislators and judges are often asked to reconcile very different definitions of <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy,</b> which are the concepts that underpin a high-quality, state-provided education, and are often confounded by attempts to achieve <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy</b> on a state-wide basis, given the differences in property tax revenues.

It presents a methodology for developing plans for optimum allocation of land area and water, considering performance measures such as productivity, <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy.</b> These irrigation schemes are characterized by limited water supply and heterogeneity in soils, crops, climate and water distribution network, etc. The methodology proposed in this paper, therefore, uses a previously developed simulation– optimization model (Area and Water Allocation Model, AWAM) that considers the heterogeneity of the irrigation scheme in the allocation process, and modifies this {{to take account of}} <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy</b> of supply to irrigated areas. The AWAM model has four phases to be executed separately for each set of irrigation interval over the irrigation season: 1. generation of irrigation strategies for each crop–soil–region combination (CSR unit), 2. preparation of irrigation programmes for each irrigation strategy, 3. selection of specified number of irrigation programmes for each CSR unit and 4. optimum allocation of land area and water to different parts of the irrigation scheme (allocation units) for maximizing productivity. In the modified AWAM model, the adequacy is included at Phase- 2 (by including only the irrigation programmes for full irrigation of each CSR unit) and equity is included at Phase- 4 (by including the constraints for equity).

These objectives conflict with each other so multiple objectives {{need to be considered}} when making decisions. An approach based on multi criteria decision making (MCDM) technique of compromise programming is presented in this paper. It consists of identifying different performance objectives (POs) (for example, productivity, equity etc.) that contribute to “overall performance index” (OPI) of irrigation management. Weights are assigned to each PO that reflects its relative importance. The values of the indicators are obtained from simulation-optimization modeling and weights are obtained by analytical hierarchical process (AHP). OPIs are obtained for different alternatives and the preferred alternative is the one that is nearest to the ideal point. The applicability of the developed approach is demonstrated with the help of case study from Maharashtra State, India, using the “AWAM” model to estimate the values of POs for different irrigation strategies or alternatives and comparison of POs obtained from the survey of head, middle and tail reach farmers.

40|$|While {{there is}} a wealth of {{research}} on school finance equity and adequacy, and school finance theory clearly documents {{differences between the two}} concepts, no study has examined whether the reforms engendered by each approach actually differ in terms of resource distribution. The present study examines the issues using district-level data on expenditure by function from two, large national data-sets: the US Census of Governments School System Finance File F- 33 (1972 - 2002) and the National Center for Education Statistics' Longitudinal School District Fiscal-Nonfiscal File (1990 - 2000). A difference-in-differences estimator with state and year fixed effects indicates that both court-mandated equity and adequacy reforms decrease resource inequities. However, estimates based on data from the F- 33 file show negligible differences between equity and adequacy reforms, while estimates based on data from the Fiscal-Nonfiscal File indicate adequacy reform does not decrease horizontal inequities as much as court-mandated equity reform. To explore these contradictory findings, we implement a two-stage regression approach that examines whether court-mandated adequacy reform is associated with a state funding mechanism accounting for certain educational needs of students. Court-mandated adequacy reform does not result in the allocation of additional resources to low-income districts when compared with states under court-mandated equity reform. We conclude that, contrary to school finance theory, resource distribution patterns following court-mandated equity and adequacy reforms are not statistically different. education finance, school finance litigation, <b>equity,</b> <b>adequacy,</b> resource distribution,...|$|E

The need for school-level financial reporting accelerated during the 1990 s as public-school stakeholders continually expressed concern over the manner in which school districts allocated resources. District-level fiscal data were insufficient in addressing such issues as <b>equity,</b> <b>adequacy,</b> and student achievement. School-level fiscal reporting provides educational decision makers with a clearer view of a school's operation and resource allocation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop school-level financial guidelines for Illinois public school districts by analyzing fiscal reporting documents from states currently collecting school-level data. The qualitative research method was used for this study. Through document analysis design, the study identified current reporting practices from states collecting school-level fiscal data. The study explored the implementation of school-level reporting in Illinois by examining current data collection methods, the need to collect additional data, and whether increased district resources would be necessary to collect and maintain the data. Also, the benefits of school-level fiscal reporting for Illinois public school stakeholders were discussed. The study revealed that 15 states currently require school-level fiscal reporting. Key elements of school-site reporting included the need to redesign the account code structure and collect specific staff and student nonfiscal data. A clear focus on how the data are to be used would determine the type of fiscal information to be collected and encourage acceptance of the new reporting model by school-district personnel. School-level fiscal reporting gives public-school officials and policymakers more and better information to use when evaluating instructional programs and services for students. This study recommends that Illinois public school districts collect fiscal data at the school site for the purpose of reporting costs associated with the instruction of students. System-wide expenses are to remain as district-level costs and reported as such. As a result of this study, a new account code structure for school-level fiscal reporting in Illinois was developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} {{of social security}} benefits rests on normative principles of social justice. Most strongly manifest in earnings-related social insurance, the principle of reciprocity has been increasingly questioned on grounds of <b>equity,</b> <b>adequacy</b> and fiscal viability, {{in the wake of}} socio-economic changes (e. g. post-industralisation, globalisation) and political developments (e. g. Europeanisation). Universalist programmes seem extraordinarily expensive under tight public budgets, and could be criticised as inequitable at a time when middle classes increasingly rely on individual and occupational forms of income security. The principle of need appears to have become more prominent within modern European social security systems keen on targeting resources. Is there empirical evidence which would reflect these alleged trends? Concentrating on three principles inherent in social security transfers (need, universalism and reciprocity) the major concerns of this article are conceptual and empirical. First, it addresses the problem of operationalising social security principles and delineating indicators of change over time. Second, it applies two of these indicators in order to identify and compare {{the extent to which the}} three principles have gained or lost prominence since the early 1980 s, with empirical evidence taken from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia. The article argues first that, applying either indicator, there is no cross-national trend towards squeezing reciprocity-based social insurance, but that a convergence between erstwhile strong (Bismarckian) and weak (Beveridgean) principled programmes can be identified. Second, a clear trend towards needs-based social security can be identified within the ¿legal¿ but not within the ¿volume¿ perspective, at least in some programmes and some claimant groups. This is due to both policy changes and favourable labour market conditions. Third, two countries indicate very diverse trends. British social security is distinctive in terms of the erosion of Beveridgean reciprocity, as well as the growing strength of the needs principle. In the Netherlands, there have been considerable shifts in principles underlying certain programmes, but no general trend in either direction can be observed. On the whole, Dutch social security continues to exhibit a strong mix of principles. ...|$|E

The input data required at various scales to assess irrigation performance, often not available, need costly intensive field campaigns.

In this study, ETc maps {{were obtained by}} combining the FAO- 56 dual approach with relationships between crop biophysical variables and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), using high spatial resolution time series of SPOT and Landsat images. This approach was applied for 2002 / 2003 growing season in Haouz plain, Morocco. Remote sensing-based indicators, reflecting <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy</b> of the irrigation water delivery were estimated. Adequacy was determined according to Relative Irrigation supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Relative Evapotranspiration (RET) and equity according to the coefficient of variation of ETc. The analysis of these indicators exhibits a great variability among fields. Variability in irrigation performance at all levels, associated factors and possible improvements are discussed.

Without Federal guidance or oversight, each of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s 50 states has had to address the issue of how tax-payer supported public education should be financed. One of the underlying assumptions of American jurisprudence is that all Americans should be treated equally under law. Equal protection guarantees are found in the 14 th Amendment of the Federal Constitution, and in various articles and amendments in all 50 state constitutions. Yet, when the issue {{of public school}} funding is considered, philosophical and legal principles run headlong into the pragmatic and real issues of how tax-generated funds should be distributed. The net result of this clash has created a significantly unequal system of public schools in states across the United States of America and, in the opinion of many state courts, denied students their rights to equal protection under law by denying them substantially equal educational opportunities. ^ The aim of this research was to investigate one particular state 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to reform a substantially unequal educational environment through legislative efforts designed to improve funding <b>equity</b> and <b>adequacy</b> across school districts. The state is Vermont, and the legislation is titled Act 68 An Act Relating to Education. Act 68 was passed by the Vermont State Legislature in February of 2004.

40|$|The {{irrigated}} {{agriculture in the}} Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) of Pakistan is characterized by huge water utilization both from surface and groundwater resources. Need of utilization of water from five rivers in Punjab province along with accelerated population growth has forced the construction of world’s largest irrigation network. Nevertheless, huge irrigation infrastructure, together with inappropriate drainage infrastructure, led to a build-up of shal-low groundwater levels, followed by waterlogging and secondary salinization in the soil profile. Following this era, decreased efficiency of irrigation supply system along with higher food demands had increased burdens on groundwater use, {{which led to a}} drop in groundwater levels in major parts of LCC. Previous studies in the study region revealed lacking management and maintenance of irrigation system, inflexible irrigation strategies, poor linkages between field level water supply and demands. No future strategy is present or under consideration to deal with this long time emerged groundwater situation particularly under unchanged irrigation water supply and climate change. Therefore, there is an utmost importance to assess the current profile of water use in the irrigation scheme and to device some workable strategies under future situations of land use and climate change. This study aims to investigate the spatio-temporal status of water utilization and performance of irrigation system using remote sensing data and techniques (SEBAL) in combination with other point data. Different irrigation performance indicators including <b>equity,</b> <b>adequacy</b> and reliability using evaporation fraction as main input parameter are utilized. Current profiles of land use/land cover (LULC) areas are assessed and their change detections are worked out to establish realistic future scenarios. Spatially distributed seasonal net recharge, a very important input parameter for groundwater modeling, is estimated by employing water balance approaches using spatial data from remote sensing and local norms. Such recharge results are also compared with a water table fluctuation approach. Following recharge estimation, a regional 3 -D groundwater flow model using FEFLOW was set up. This model was calibrated by different approaches ranging from manual to automated pilot point (PP) approach. Sensitivity analysis was performed to see the model response against different model input parameters and to identify model regions which demand further improvements. Future climate parameters were downscaled to establish scenarios by using statistical downscaling under IPCC future emission scenarios. Modified recharge raster maps were prepared under both LULC and climate change scenarios and were fed to the groundwater model to investigate groundwater dynamics. Seasonal consumptive water use analysis revealed almost double use for kharif as compared to rabi cropping seasons with decrease from upper LCC to lower regions. Intra irrigation subdivision analysis of equity, an important irrigation performance indicator, shows less differences in water consumption in LCC. However, the other indicators (adequacy and reliability) indicate that the irrigation system is neither adequate nor reliable. Adequacy is found more pronounced during kharif as compared to rabi seasons with aver-age evaporation fraction of 0. 60 and 0. 67, respectively. Similarly, reliability is relatively higher in upper LCC regions as compared to lower regions. LULC classification shows that wheat and rice are major crops with least volatility in cultivation from season to season. The results of change detection show that cotton exhibited maximum positive change while kharif fodder showed maximum negative change during 2005 - 2012. Transformation of cotton area to rice cultivation is less conspicuous. The water consumption in upper LCC regions with similar crops is relatively higher as compared to lower regions. Groundwater recharge results revealed that, during the kharif cropping seasons, rainfall is the main source of recharge followed by field percolation losses, while for rabi cropping seasons, canal seepage remains the major source. Seasonal net groundwater recharge is mainly positive during all kharif seasons with a gradual increase in groundwater level in major parts of LCC. Model optimization indicates that PP is more flexible and robust as compared to manual and zone based approaches. Different statistical indicators show that this method yields reliable calibration and validation as values of Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency are 0. 976 and 0. 969, % BIAS are 0. 026 and - 0. 205 and root mean square errors are 1. 23 m and 1. 31 m, respectively. Results of model output sensitivity suggest that hydraulic conductivity is a more influential parameter in the study area than drain/fillable porosity. Model simulation results under different scenarios show that rice cultivation has the highest impact on groundwater levels in upper LCC regions whereas major negative changes are observed for lower parts under decreased kharif fodder area in place of rice, cotton and sugarcane. Fluctuations in groundwater level among different proposed LULC scenarios are within ± 1 m, thus showing a limited potential for groundwater management. For future climate scenarios, a rise in groundwater level is observed for 2011 to 2025 under H 3 A 2 emission regime. Nevertheless, a drop in groundwater level is expected due to increased crop consumptive water use and decreased precipitations under H 3 A 2 scenario for the periods 2026 - 2035 and 2036 - 2045. Although no imminent threat of groundwater shortage is anticipated, there is an opportunity for developing groundwater resources in the lower model regions through water re-allocation that would be helpful in dealing water shortages. The groundwater situation under H 3 B 2 emission regime is relatively complex due to very low expectation of rise in groundwater level through precipitation during 2011 - 2025. Any positive change in groundwater under such scenarios is mainly associated with changes in crop consumptive water uses. Consequently, water management under such situation requires revisiting of current cropping patterns as well as augmenting water supply through additional surface water resources...|$|E

[...] Johnson told The Dispatch [...] "I need unlimited, unfettered discretion to seek every fact I can find in order to come to a decent conclusion. [...] What {{we want to do is}} make sure the senators and representatives are competently representing the will of the people." [...] The senator also claimed seventeenth-century English common law justified his plan.|$|R

Banks' optimal asset/liability policy is such that in equilibrium capital adequacy constraints are always binding. Asymmetric information about banks' net worth adds a cost to outside equity capital, which limits {{the extent to which}} banks can relax their capital constraint. In this context monetary policy does not affect bank lending through changes in bank liquidity. Rather, it has the effect of changing the aggregate composition of financing by firms. The model also produces multiple equilibria, one of which displays all the features of a ‘credit crunch’. Thus, monetary policy can also have large effects when it induces a shift between equilibria. corporate finance; <b>equity</b> capital <b>adequacy</b> constraints; monetary policy...|$|R

Broadly defined as sufficient input levels to ensure student achievement of learning goals, adequacy has roots in school finance litigation in the United States of America. A review of school finance literature shows different conceptions of adequacy; as an input measure, an educational outcome measure, and a legal theory. The realisation that equity was not easily attainable, led plaintiffs in North American states to embrace and pursue adequacy as an alternative to, or step {{in the direction of}} attaining equity. The evolution of the school funding debate from <b>equity</b> to <b>adequacy</b> in the United States has relevance to the South African context, with obvious limitations. This article explores the promises and limits of adequacy in the South African context...|$|R
