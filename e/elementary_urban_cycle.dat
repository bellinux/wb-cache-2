40|$|Amputated {{from the}} term cybernetics, the prefix cyber- vaguely {{indicates}} that a thing is in some way digital or computer-mediated. The term cybercities is used broadly to indicate that cities have become a different order of thing {{by virtue of the}} insertion of digital communications networks and other computer technology into the urban fabric. In this paper I endeavor to contribute to a reclaiming of the cyber- prefix to propose a more appropriate and useful interpretation of the mediated city more akin to the ethos of cybernetic theory. I put forward a model of an <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> by which a city is instantiated and sustained. This cycle is divided into four phases [...] design, build, inhabit, and reflect [...] which also correspond to the purviews of different groups of professional or grassroots urban actors in conventional urban contexts.

Corrected emissions were computed by deducting ambient reading from sample reading. Paper describes detail emission test procedure and results obtained. CO emissions were {{in the range of}} 38. 9 to 111. 3 ppm. HC emissions were in the range of 18. 2 to 62. 6 ppm. Nox emissions were 08 to 3. 9 ppm and CO 2 emissions were from 6719. 2 to 8051 ppm.

Recently, {{there has been an}} influx of more than one million Myanmar immigrants into urban centres of Thailand. The prevalence of patent Wuchereria bancrofti infection in these immigrants (2 - 5 %) has prompted concern in the public health community that the potential now exists for a re-emergence of Bancroftian filariasis in Thailand. It is possible that an <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> of transmission could become established. The Myanmar immigrants are infected with the nocturnal periodic (urban) type W. bancrofti for which Culex quinquefasciatus serves as the main vector. The Thai strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus have never been reported to transmit Bancroftian filariasis. Our results of feeding experiments demonstrated that the Thai Cx. quinquefasciatus are permissive for the development of Myanmar W. bancrofti to infective third-stage larvae thus establishing the potential for establishing an <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> of transmission in Thailand.

50|$|IUWM is {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} strategy for achieving the goals of Water Sensitive Urban Design. IUWM seeks to change the impact of urban development on the natural water cycle, {{based on the premise}} that by managing the <b>urban</b> water <b>cycle</b> as a whole; a more efficient use of resources can be achieved providing not only economic benefits but also improved social and environmental outcomes. One approach is to establish an inner, <b>urban,</b> water <b>cycle</b> loop through the implementation of reuse strategies.

Accounting for flows in the pre- and post-development systems is an important step toward limiting urban impacts on the natural water cycle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sylvatic dengue viruses (DENVs) are {{transmitted}} between non-human primates and arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes in Southeast Asia and west Africa. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} the risk for re-emergence of sylvatic DENV into the <b>urban</b> endemic/epidemic <b>cycle</b> may be high, which could limit the potential for eradicating the human transmission cycle with vaccines now under development. We assessed the likelihood of sylvatic DENV re-emergence in the face of immunity to current endemic strains or vaccines by evaluating the neutralization capacity of sera from DENV vaccinees and convalescent patients after primary infection with DENV- 2 and DENV- 3 serotypes. Our data indicate robust homotypic cross-immunity between human sera and sylvatic DENV strains, but limited heterotypic neutralization. Should a licensed vaccine lead to the eradication of the <b>urban</b> transmission <b>cycle</b> in the future, re-emergence of sylvatic strains into the <b>urban</b> <b>cycle</b> would be limited by homotypic immunity mediated by virus-neutralizing antibodies. Sylvatic dengue viruses (DENVs) are both ecologically and evolutionary distinct from urban DENVs and {{are transmitted}} in an enzootic cycle most likely between non-human primates and arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes. In Southeast Asia, iso-lations of zoonotic DENV- 1, DENV- 2, and DENV- 4 sugges...|$|R

It is found that the wastewater treatment consumes the biggest share of the total energy (44 %), but a significant part of this energy demand is provided by the energy in biogas produced from wastewater sludge. On the basis of this study it was possible to provide strategic recommendations to the water utility on how to improve the water/energy/carbon nexus and contribute better to sustainability performance of <b>urban</b> water <b>cycle</b> system...|$|R
