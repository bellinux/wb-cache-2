40|$|A {{critical}} review is given of {{the physics of}} colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials (manganites and other degenerate <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>semiconductors).</b> The basic idea is that their speciflc properties (the resistivity peak close to TC, CMR and so on) {{are not related to}} the electron{lattice interaction but are caused by static °uctuations of the magnetisation induced by ionised donors or acceptors. Their screening by charge carriers causes °uctuations of their density and, hence, °uctuations of the intensity of indirect exchange via them. The °uctuations of the magnetisation induced by the latter are maximally close to TC, which explains the speciflc features of these materials. 1. Manganites as <b>Ferromagnetic</b> <b>Semiconductors</b> A speciflc feature of the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> is a peak of the resistivity ‰ close to the Curie point TC.

Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics yields detailed information about the asymmetric tunnel barrier. The low temperature conductance-voltage characteristics show a zero bias anomaly and a V^ 1 / 2 dependence of the conductance, indicating a correlation gap in the density of states of GaMnAs.
