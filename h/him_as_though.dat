25|$|When Superintendent Spence arrives to see Poirot, {{the detective}} reacts to <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{it has been}} many years since the case on which they worked. The case in {{question}} was, however, the one retold in Taken at the Flood, which is the previous novel in the series, and was explicitly set in 1946. At most, it can only have been six years since they last worked together. Of course, chronologies are difficult to construct, especially with Poirot's career.|$|E
25|$|Belbo goes to Agliè privately and {{describes}} The Plan to <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{it were the}} result of serious research. He also claims to be in possession of the secret Templar map. Agliè becomes frustrated with Belbo's refusal to let him see this (non-existent) map. He frames Belbo as a terrorist suspect in order to force him to come to Paris. Agliè has cast himself as the head of a secret spiritual brotherhood, which includes Mr. Garamond, Colonel Ardenti and many of the Diabolical authors. Belbo tries to get help from De Angelis, but he has just transferred to Sardinia after an attempted car bombing, and refuses to get involved.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{was born}} in {{suburban}} East London and lived on Hackney Road as a child. He was orphaned at a young age, and moved to Islington to be raised by his two sisters, who ran a school there. They raised <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were a child of their own. The income from the school allowed them to live a comfortable lifestyle. He was taught by Henry Butter, a well-respected author who had written a much-read treatise on teaching spelling. As a child, Nicholson was fascinated by clowns, and often spent time watching them. Nicholson moved to Shadwell as a young man, and began working as an apprentice to a pawnbroker.|$|E

500|$|While {{waiting in}} the green room, Larson met Ed Long, a Baptist {{minister}} from California booked for the third episode of the session. They struck up a conversation. Long recalled that Larson asked {{how many times he}} had seen the show. When Long replied he had seen it only once, Larson responded by looking at <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he [...] "were from another planet." [...] Larson told Long, [...] "I really hope we don't have to play each other" [...] before leaving the green room, but they would in fact face off as Long won his match and a total of $11,516 in cash and prizes. The two men competed against Janie Litras, a dental assistant, in the next episode of the session.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson died in London of {{complications}} following a road accident. [...] Recalling his funeral, the Bishop of Knaresborough remarked [...] "As I gazed {{down on the}} rapt faces of that vast congregation, I could see how they revered <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were the Almighty, though, of course, infinitely stronger on the leg side." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walton did not {{profess to}} be an expert with a fishing fly; the fly fishing in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who {{produced}} a treatise of his own in 1659; but {{in the use of the}} live worm, the grasshopper and the frog [...] "Piscator" [...] himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog, often misquoted as being about the worm—"use <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the longer"—appears in the original edition. Cotton's additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties.|$|E

2500|$|Sarai treated Hagar well, and induced {{women who}} came to visit her to visit Hagar also. Hagar, when {{pregnant}} by Abraham, began to act superciliously toward Sarai, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her. Some believe Sarai was originally destined to reach the age of 175 years, but forty-eight years of this span of life were taken away from her because she complained of Abraham, blaming <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was the cause that Hagar no longer respected her. Sarah was sterile; but a miracle was granted to her after her name was changed from [...] "Sarai" [...] to [...] "Sarah". According to one myth, when her fertility had been restored and she {{had given birth to}} Isaac, the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notabilities to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, also, who brought their infants with them; and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the strange children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis of the Talmud disputed whether Reuben sinned in [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman said in Rabbi Jonathan's {{name that}} whoever {{maintains}} that Reuben sinned errs, for [...] says, [...] "Now {{the sons of}} Jacob were twelve," [...] teaching {{that they were all}} equal in righteousness. [...] Rabbi Jonathan interpreted the beginning of [...] "and he lay with Bilhah his father's concubine," [...] to teach that Reuben moved his father's bed from Bilhah’s tent to Leah's tent, and Scripture imputes blame to <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he had lain with her. [...] Similarly, it was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar said that the righteous Reuben was saved from sin. [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar asked how Reuben’s descendants could possibly have been directed to stand on Mount Ebal and proclaim in [...] "Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife," [...] if Reuben had sinned with Bilhah. [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar interpreted [...] "and he lay with Bilhah his father's concubine," [...] to teach that Reuben resented his mother Leah's humiliation, and did not want Rachel’s maid Bilhah to join Rachel as a rival to Leah. [...] So Reuben moved her bed. [...] Others told that Reuben moved two beds, one of the Divine Presence ( [...] , Shechinah) and the other of his father, as Jacob set a couch for the Divine Presence in each of his wives’ tents, and he spent the night where the Divine Presence came to rest. [...] According to this view, one should read [...] to say, [...] "Then you defiled my couch on which (the Divine Presence) went up." [...] But the Gemara also reported disputes among the Tannaim on how to interpret the word [...] "unstable ( [...] , pachaz)" [...] in [...] where Jacob called Reuben, [...] "unstable ( [...] , pachaz) as water."
