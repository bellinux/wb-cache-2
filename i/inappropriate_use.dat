Nationwide cross-sectional, register-based study in the entire Sweden in 2008.

We applied all drug-specific criteria included in the 2012 Beers Criteria, the Laroche's list, the PRISCUS list, the NORGEP criteria and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare criteria. Main outcome was the potentially <b>inappropriate</b> drug <b>use</b> according to each set of criteria, separately and combined. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify individual factors associated with the <b>use</b> of potentially <b>inappropriate</b> drugs. The prevalence of potentially <b>inappropriate</b> medication <b>use</b> varied between the explicit criteria from 16 % (NORGEP criteria) to 24 % (2012 Beers criteria). Overall, 38 % of the older people were exposed to potentially <b>inappropriate</b> drug <b>use</b> {{by at least one}} of the five sets of criteria. While controlling for other possible covariates, female gender, institutionalisation and polypharmacy were systematically associated with <b>inappropriate</b> drug <b>use,</b> regardless of the set of explicit criteria we considered.

Historian Alan Clark reported that von Wietersheim returned to Germany after his dismissal, only reappearing in any military context in 1945 as a private in a Pomeranian Volkssturm unit. There is a reference that Wietersheim was the Chief of the Military Transport Division in 1942, perhaps as an immediate replacement to his command of the XIV Panzer Corps, but it is clear that whether a 61-year-old private or military functionary, his career was over.|$|E

25|$|However {{in spite}} of public outrage the Spanish {{government}} has {{made no attempt to}} reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them. The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers. Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and <b>inappropriate</b> <b>use</b> of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Judaism still regards tithe {{obligations}} as {{in effect}} on produce {{grown in the}} Land of Israel, although the obligations have been somewhat modified {{since the days of}} the Hebrew Bible and Talmud and proceeds from the tithes are no longer given to a Kohen or Levite or taken to Jerusalem. Current practice is for the owner the produce to set aside terumah, then designate maaser rishon, then separate terumat maaser, and then, on the first, second, fourth and fifth years of the Shemittah cycle, redeem Maaser Sheni on a coin of minimal value capable of purchasing food, which need not be equal in value to the amount set aside. The coin, and a total of a little over 1% of the produce which cannot be redeemed is set aside or discarded in a way intended to prevent its future use and in a manner consistent with the sanctity of the separated portions. The reason for discarding in such a manner is that the set-aside produce is still considered mikudash or sacred. While dedicated offerings cannot actually be offered in their traditional form in the absence of the Temple, because one must consume terumah and maaser sheni in a state of purity, they also cannot be used for mundane purposes. However, the mundane use of maaser sheni was not considered me'ilah (unauthorized or <b>inappropriate</b> <b>use</b> of Temple property/hekdesh).|$|E

News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his <b>inappropriate</b> <b>use</b> of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After [...] "Didn't We Almost Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal.

In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series.
