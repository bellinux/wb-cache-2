40|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} building information modeling (BIM) for application {{in the construction}} of eco-friendly green buildings has given rise to techniques for evaluating green buildings constructed using BIM features. Existing BIM-based green building evaluation techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the “green template”) for evaluating the <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact,</b> and constructed a database of the impact factors of the <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of the major building materials, thereby adopting an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation table of the <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of the building materials. Finally, the green template was developed as an <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its applicability. The results of the green template-based <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> evaluation of a test building were validated against those of its actual quantity takeoff (2 D takeoff), and its reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of ≤ 5 %. This study aims to develop a system for assessing the impact of the substances discharged from concrete production process on six environmental impact categories, i. e., global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), abiotic depletion (ADP), ozone depletion (ODP), and photochemical oxidant creation (POCP), using the life a cycle assessment (LCA) method. To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations...|$|E
40|$|Addressing the {{challenges}} of <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of materials has led to growing interest {{in the use of}} earth as a construction material and the use of commercial methods of extruding bricks has potential to overcome many of the barriers of adoption. Without the usual firing process, the bricks could have a significantly lower <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> and similar dimensions (approximately 100 mm thick), to conventional masonry. However, the wider adoption of 100 mm thick unfired earth masonry is dependent on its suitability for use in structurally load-bearing applications. Currently the greatest barrier to earth masonry adoption is the durability of the material when subjected to high moisture contents. Accidental or intentional wetting of a 100 mm thick load bearing unfired earth wall could lead to disproportionate collapse unless the moisture resistance is improved. To overcome the concern of elevated moisture contents, a standard approach is to chemically stabilise the soil through the addition of either cement or lime. While there has been research into the use of cement and lime for other forms of earth construction, the use for extruded earth bricks has not been investigated in depth. The source materials and inherent physical properties of extruded earth bricks are different to other forms of earthen construction therefore the suitability of cement and lime to stabilise soil for the purpose of extruded earth bricks requires investigation. This research demonstrates the improvement in 28 day compressive strength, with a range of cement or lime contents and three initial curing temperatures. Small scale bricks are used for testing purposes and are tested in both the ambient environmental conditions and following 24 hours of full submersion in water. Key factors such density and moisture content, are shown to be important for compressive strength development but the effect of stabilisation and the specific stabiliser used {{has been shown to be}} more important than density and moisture content alone...|$|E
40|$|Blinds and {{shutters}} create privacy {{during the}} day and night in residential and commercial buildings. They are also used to keep rooms cool when sunny and to minimise heat loss at night or in winter; in turn this reduces use of air conditioning and heating, associated energy inputs, carbon and equivalent outputs and costs. As well as controlling temperature, blinds and shutters can be used to reduce glare, control light levels and to contribute to general health and well-being. Despite these various benefits in many instances in the UK blinds and shutters are not opened and closed and/or adjusted correctly and consequently the above benefits are not fully realised. One means of addressing this problem to ensure maximum operational energy savings and thermal comfort is the implementation of motorised and/or automatic blind opening and closing. By default however this increases the number and variety of components, materials and manufacturing processes and <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> In this study Life Cycle Assessment is used to measure and compare combined <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> and potential operational energy savings of a variety of types of manual, motorised and automated blinds in a typical domestic environment in the UK. Currently the majority of manually operated blinds and shutters are either sent to landfill or incinerated with energy recovery at end of life even though the materials, manufacturing and assembly processes for these products indicate that reuse and recycling are relatively easy to achieve. Not only does this study clearly illustrate the benefits of reuse and recycling all types of blind at end-of-life, it also highlights the necessity for doing so in the case of motorised and automated systems. In addition to recycling the paper explores other business models (such as component reuse, remanufacture, leasing, buying a service), all of which are associated with the development of a Circular Economy for this sector. Finally this paper discusses specific challenges for this industry...|$|E

30|$|Nansai et al. (2014) {{characterized}} the international flow of metals by the technology level of countries. The authors categorized Japan as a “high-level production technology and material-use efficiency” country. If Japanese products containing alloying elements are exported to the countries categorized {{as the same}} level as Japan, flows are classified as “green flows,” which means that material-use efficiency is the highest because both producing and consuming countries have high levels of technologies. In this case, alloying elements would be well utilized and recycled with high technologies. By contrast, when Japanese products are exported to low-technology-level countries, the flows become “yellow flows,” which are defined as “moderately efficient.” In these flows, alloying elements in exported products may dissipate {{because of the lack of}} recycling technologies in the consumed countries. To reduce the flows in this category, as one potential solution, high-level countries should export their technologies and systems to low-level countries (Nansai et al. 2014). This kind of activity may reduce the need for both primary metal production and <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> not only in the Japan-oriented supply system discussed in this study but also in the global supply chain.|$|R
40|$|The {{residential}} sector {{is recognized as}} a major energy consumer and thus a significant contributor to climate change. Rather than focus only on current energy consumption and the associated emissions, {{there is a need}} to broaden sustainability research to include full life cycle contributions and impacts. This thesis looks at houses from the perspective of the Ecological Footprint (EF), a well-known sustainability indicator. The research objective is to integrate EF and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) measures to provide an enhanced tool to measure the sustainability implications of residential energy retrofit decisions. Exemplifying single-detached houses of the early 20 th century, the century-old REEP House (downtown Kitchener, Canada), together with its high performance energy retrofits, is examined in detail. This research combines material, energy and carbon emission studies. Its scope covers the life cycle of the house, including the direct and indirect consumption of material and energy, and concomitant carbon emissions during its stages of material extraction, transportation, construction, operation, and demolition. The results show that the REEP House had a significant embodied impact on the environment when it was built and high operating energy and EF requirements because of the low levels of insulation. Even though the renovations to improve energy efficiency by 80 % introduce additional <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> they are environmentally sound activities because the environmental payback period is less than two years...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) environmental management tool to measure the performance, at laboratory scale, {{of a range of}} iron and palladium based nanoparticle catalysts for carbon dioxide utilisation (CDU). The catalysts combine the reverse-water gas shift reaction with the Fischer-Tropsch process to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2) into hydrocarbons (HCs) often employed as fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry; offering the potential synthesis of HCs void of fossil fuel extraction. The catalysts operational performance was shown to vary considerably dependent on the specific iron:palladium loadings. LCA results afforded insight into 'green' catalyst design, palladium addition vastly improves catalyst performance. However, with such a high <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> a trade-off is witnessed whereby the continual addition of palladium, although shows favourable CO 2 conversion and HC yields, does not return a sufficient environmental offset in terms of produced HCs to cover the embodied impacts present in its formation. With the present laboratory setup their embodied environmental impacts are several orders of magnitude more impactful than traditional process pathways, largely due to the electricity use; a switch to renewable generators can reduce the overall process impacts by 90 %, a significant step in increasing the competitiveness of the process, a use of renewable electricity in the synthesis of hydrogen further strengthens the case for its use in HC production has environmental merit. Indeed, from a material exchange perspective the H 2 consumes is of a lesser environmental impact than those offset through the HCs produced. As with all laboratory processes, it is very likely that process scale-up and refinement will further enhance the results witnessed in this study...|$|E
40|$|The use of gypsum {{plasterboard}} is ubiquitous within {{the construction industry}} and equates to an approximate 3. 5 % of the UK’s green house gas emissions. Production alone accounts for 67 % of {{gypsum plasterboard}}’s life cycle global warming potential. Developing alternative boards, using materials with lower life-cycle impacts, offers significant scope to reduce current environmental impacts of plasterboard use. There {{has been an increase}} in research that demonstrates the potential of plasters with bio-aggregates to enhance indoor environmental quality. Board solutions that contain bio-aggregates within the core will help to further develop this potential. Such boards {{can be used in a}} conventional manner reducing on-site barriers to adoption, while offering a value added product with improved hygrothermal performance. This paper presents the development of an alternative plasterboard composed of hemp shiv which is bound by mineralogical aggregate composition. Different boards were developed using the binding properties of clay to ensure a low <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> The results of the different binding mechanisms of the clay based plasterboards were experimentally investigated and compared to conventional gypsum plasterboard. A range of mechanical and hygrothermal properties were investigated to establish the potential of a bio-based plasterboard. Standard test methods developed for gypsum plasterboard were used to establish the flexural, shear and impact resistance of the boards, while the investigation of hygrothermal properties considered the thermal conductivity, moisture buffering performance and isotherms. The alternative plasterboard had up to five times better moisture buffering properties compared to a gypsum plasterboard and a significantly lower thermal conductivity. While significant improvement of the hygrothermal properties have been observed, there has been a reduction in the mechanical performance of the alternative boards. However, rationale is presented indicating that the alternative plasterboards developed could be adopted in a comparable manner to conventional plasterboards, resulting in an improved indoor environmental quality with a reduced environmental impact...|$|E
40|$|The UK is {{committed}} to reducing {{the environmental impact of}} construction, but due to growing population there is a requirement for new domestic housing. The <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> is going to become an increasingly significant proportion of the whole life cycle of a building. There is therefore a requirement for research into low environmental impact construction materials. There has been a resurgence of earthen construction techniques as a response to growing environmental awareness and consideration. This has led to a renewed interest in earth construction and an increased use of earth within contemporary architecture. However, there are many barriers to the mainstream adoption of traditional methods of earthen construction, and only with the widespread adoption can the benefits be fully utilised. Extruded earth bricks that are manufactured using the well established fired brick production methods, without the firing can produce consistent, high quality, low cost bricks. As the bricks are of the same dimensions as current masonry there are fewer barriers to the adoption. This form factor, crucial for contemporary construction, relies on wall thicknesses of only 100 mm. It has been shown that extruded earth bricks have a suitable strength for typical domestic loading. However, there are concerns about structural use due to loss of strength under elevated moisture contents; representing the greatest barrier to adoption. Stabilisation is a method by which the soil properties can be changed to increase strength under saturated condition. This thesis aim is to develop suitable methods of stabilisation for extruded earth bricks, with a lower environmental impact than existing masonry units. The scope is limited to the extrusion process and the soil currently used for fired brick production. To this extent seven brick soils used in the manufacture of commercially fired bricks were investigated into their physiochemical properties and engineering properties with respect to the identified mineralogy. There has been limited literature focusing on extruded earth bricks which is in part due to the difficulties of specimen manufacture. Two methods of laboratory scale specimen production were investigated and compared to full scale unfired bricks. A small scale extruder was used to make one third linear scale bricks and was shown to be suitable representation for unstabilised conditions. This allowed for laboratory scale testing of extruded specimens. Three categories of chemical stabiliser were investigated including cement, lime and alkali hydroxides. Compressive strength development over 7, 14 and 28 days was determined for specimens tested in ambient conditions and following 24 hours fully submerged in water. Varying mass fractions and initial curing regimes were investigated to determine the effect on compressive strength. Only 5 % lime initially cured at 60 ◦C met the required structural criteria of a ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ compressive strength of 2. 9 and 1. 0 MPa respectively. Metakaolin was subsequently added as a secondary stabiliser to improve the strength for all the primary additives. The change in compressive strength was variable, but did enable a total of six specimens to meet the required criteria, all with 5 % lime as the primary stabiliser. A cradle-to-gate LCA was undertaken for the unstabilised and stabilised extruded earth bricks. The analysis only considered embodied energy and global warming potential and compared the results to conventional masonry units. Environmental criteria were developed based on the conventional masonry unit with the minimum impact. Considering this criteria, only two mixes were able to offer an improvement of the global warming potential. The reliance on highly processed commercial metakaolin was investigated by the partial thermal treatment of the brick soil. While the investigated chemical properties of this material were comparable to the metakaolin, the particle size distribution was significantly different. This resulted in a decrease in density, and no strength development when used with 5 % lime. This study has shown the potential for extruded earth masonry to be used structurally and the requirement for stabilisation. A possible stabilisation technique has been proposed which will allow for the reduction of the embodied global warming potential, whilst meeting the structural requirements...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the need}} for a more {{circular}} economy is supported by diverse people in both politics {{as well as in the}} scientific community, implementation of circular principles in reality is rarely occurring. This study shows how quantitative models can help to develop new policies for enhancing circularity in the construction sector. By means of a bottom-up construction materials model, an analysis of the circular opportunities for the Netherlands was developed. First of all, the national material stock in the built environment and their <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> were assessed. Next, the most important flows (being reinforced concrete, bricks, timber, aluminium and glass and copper) were subjected to an environmental quick scan. With this quick scan, potential alternatives for more circular end-of-life treatment routes could be compared and ranked by their effectiveness. The study was finalized by interviewing stakeholders about the political practicability of the outcomes and by defining recommendations for new policy development. In comparison to a business-as-usual scenario, the circular treatments of the selected materials show a reduction potential up to around 30 % of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> over their full life cycles. When compared to the total national construction material demand in the coming years, considering all materials, these circular treatments could help to achieve a reduction of around 10 %. The outcomes and the feasibility for implementation were discussed with stakeholders. The construction material model was based on generic and average construction practises, but even though this bottom-up approach is sensitive for assumptions, it proved to be a useful tool to start policy discussions thanks to its informative visualizations. The model can be further refined in case study projects, but it is yet ready to identify environmental hotspots and provide input for discussions about circular strategies...|$|R

40|$|Network-bound {{systems are}} crucial in {{environmental}} governance as {{the usage of}} their services <b>embody</b> significant <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> Conditions for network-bound systems providing services to consumers have altered dramatically over the last decades. Liberalization and privatization {{have led to a}} differentiation in providers, technologies, products and services, very a-typical for sectors that were formerly characterized by public and uniform modes of provision and consumption. The paper gives an overview of what the socio-technical differentiation of network-bound systems and services imply for end-users and how new relations emerge between users and providers of water and electricity services. Drawing upon contemporary theory development in science and technology studies and in environmental sociology, the paper presents recent empirical findings of differentiation and innovation in drinking water supply, waste water management and electricity supply in the Netherlands. From these developments, the paper concludes that sustainable innovation in network-bound systems leads to a differentiation of not only resources, providers and technologies but also of consumer roles towards provision and use of water and energy services in various ways. Considering that those diverse services are combined in consumers' social practices, a plea is made for a practice-inclusive perspective on understanding and enhancing sustainable innovation in network-bound systems...|$|R

In this paper, a framework to attribute emissions and water use to individual and all food retail businesses and their products by geographical area and postcode of cities is presented.

40|$|Several bodies {{including}} the DOE, ASHRAE and the IEA SHC Task 40 {{are working on}} developing definitions for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). Most existing definitions are based on setting a performance metric (quantity and quality) such as site energy, source energy, energy costs, or emissions, and a boundary for the energy source. However, the problem of most existing definitions is that they neglect the energy use during the whole building lifecycle, neglect the climatic context, neglect the urban or city scale, derive from a ‘zero’ or neutralizing notion, link the energy use to area separately from occupants and do not specify the intended definition audience they address e. g. policymakers or building developers or construction professionals. On the other hand, the cradle to cradle approach encourages the creation of ecologically positive footprint buildings where buildings are very efficient by design and by using suitable technologies to become energy positive.

Renewable and certified resources {{will continue to}} provide a viable low impact supply chain for construction, yet {{the use of such}} low impact building materials (LIBM) remains a small proportion of the current market. Structural engineers should be encouraged to use LIBM and consider the impacts of building construction, and so the research aim was to create an informed and responsible approach for structural engineers to reduce the embodied impacts of their projects. The limited amount of academic literature on the consideration of embodied impacts within construction and the use of LIBM prompted a two-phase research methodology. The first Problem Exploration phase developed a rich understanding of the current context of embodied impacts within construction through an analysis of data gathered from an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The findings identified three key aspects to consider when developing an Embodied Impact Reduction Approach (EIRA); the alignment of the project-life cycle with influence, the limitation of time and costs, and the importance of support and education within the approach created. The second Action phase developed EIRA using the findings and supplementary data gathered from focus groups, which highlighted that EIRA should be flexible so as to be relevant to the breadth of projects that BuroHappold Engineering, who partially sponsored the research, work on. EIRA runs parallel to the RIBA Plan of Work, adapting to the different objectives, level of detail and information available at each project stage. Three components were developed; the Material Design Sheets, Carbon Calculator, and the Option Appraisal Support Technique (tOAST). tOAST was implemented on five projects to test its applicability, which identified that greater understanding of embodied impacts plus their relative importance to each other is required.

However, the majority of existing studies focus on operational requirements or on material stocks. To date, very few studies have quantified <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> requirements of building stocks and spatialised them. This study describes a bottom-up approach to spatially model building stocks and quantify their <b>embodied</b> <b>environmental</b> requirements. It uses a highly disaggregated approach where each building's geometry is modelled and used to derive a bill of quantities. Construction assemblies relevant to each building archetype (derived based on land-use, age and height) are defined using expert knowledge in construction. The initial and recurrent embodied energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions associated with each material within each assembly are calculated using a comprehensive hybrid analysis technique. This model is applied to all buildings of the City of Melbourne, Australia. Results show that rebuilding the City of Melbourne's building stock today would require 904 kt of materials/km² (total: 32 725 kt), 10 PJ/km² (total: 362 PJ), 17. 7 Million m³ of embodied water/km² (total: 640. 74 Million m³) and would emit 605 ktCO 2 e/km² (total: 23 530 ktCO 2 e).
