5|$|The {{political}} struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, via international power politics; the Russian Empire's failed 1904–1905 war against Japan {{led to the}} 1905 Revolution in Russia and to a general strike in Finland.

5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Colleges {{arrange the}} {{tutorial}} teaching for their undergraduates, {{and the members}} of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).|$|E
5|$|In 1826 commissioners <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and {{economic}} improvement of Oldham were established.

In 1880, parts of the Hollinwood and Crossbank areas of Chadderton and Ashton-under-Lyne townships were added to the Borough of Oldham. Oldham Above Town and Oldham Below Town were, from 1851 until c. 1881, statistical units used for the gathering and organising of civil registration information, and output of census data.|$|E

There, Casson was educated at St Mary's College, Paddington before going to secretarial college at her father's behest. After qualifying, she worked as a secretary for her fathers' organ-building business until his retirement. In 1908, Casson was a working as housing manager <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> reformer, Octavia Hill, taking care of the living conditions of residents at Red Cross Hall in Southwark. For the next five years she organised recreational activities at the hall, focusing on the arts. Octavia Hill's philosophy influenced Casson's work over the following years.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly {{the establishment of}} the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E
