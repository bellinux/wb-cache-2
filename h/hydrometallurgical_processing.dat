40|$|The {{useful life}} of {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (EEE) has been shortened {{as a consequence}} of the advancement in technology and change in consumer patterns. This has resulted in the generation of large quantities of electronic waste (e-waste) that needs to be managed. The handling of e-waste including combustion in incinerators, disposing in landfill or exporting overseas is no longer permitted due to environmental pollution and global legislations. Additionally, the presence of precious metals (PMs) makes e-waste recycling attractive economically. In this paper, current metallurgical processes for the extraction of metals from e-waste, including existing industrial routes, are reviewed.

50|$|The {{question}} of where Voisey ore would be processed had previously {{been one of the}} obstacles to developing the site, with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador demanding that a facility be built in the province to provide jobs there, while Inco workers in Sudbury and Thompson were simultaneously threatening to strike if the ore was not sent to their existing facilities in order to preserve and protect their jobs.

The presence of reactive clay minerals (e. g., muscovite and chlorite) plays a pivotal role in defining the pulp chemistry and concomitant {{particle interactions}} through incongruent leaching. In the present work, the influence of two hydrolysable metal ions (Al(III) and Fe(III)) which invariably leach out of clay particles, on pulp/interfacial chemistry and rheology of low Fe-substituted muscovite dispersions has been investigated at pH range 3 - 10 and 25 C. Metal ion-induced interfacial changes were cation type and pH-dependent, where Al(III) showed stronger impact on particle zeta potential behaviour at similar ion concentrations. These interfacial changes also influenced the muscovite particles' interactions, reflected in significantly enhanced dispersion shear yield stresses. The treatment of the particle zeta potential and shear yield stress data with elastic floc model revealed the emergence of unexpected additional attractive forces; the nature of those depended upon metal ion type and ionic strength. These metal ion-induced, additional attractive particle interactions are believed to emerge via different mechanisms such as enhanced van der Waals attraction, electrostatic-charge patch attraction, adsorbed ion correlation-particle bridging, surface nucleation and cementation. ...|$|R

Rheological studies of 0. 32 solid volume fraction (57 wt% solid) aqueous dispersions of muscovite clay mineral aging at pH 7 and 1 for 4 h were undertaken {{to investigate the}} temporal, pulp chemistry-mediated particle interactions. In particular, the dispersions’ flow and deformation behaviour in tandem with viscoelastic structure changes over time were probed. Dispersions at both pH 7 and 1 displayed non-Newtonian, Bingham plastic behaviour and strong time-dependent viscosities and yield stresses. Fresh dispersions showed a weak rheology at pH 7 initially, accompanied by thixotropy which transformed to anti-thixotropic and rheopectic behaviour upon aging. Furthermore, the viscosities, yield stresses and both the viscous (G″) and elastic (G′) moduli accentuated dramatically with time, reflecting an elastic to a more sol-like viscoelastic gel transformation. In contrast to pH 7, the particle interactions at pH 1 initially {{led to the formation}} of a highly networked gel structure which displayed thixotropic and predominantly elastic behaviour. Upon aging however, systematic attenuation of thixotropy, suspension viscosity, shear yield stress and viscoelasticity occurred. Above certain shear stresses, viscoelastic gel to sol structure transformation occurred, the creep behaviour being distinctly pH and time dependent. Differing pH-mediated pulp chemistries which prevailed at pH 7 and 1 upon aging were responsible for the contrasting, temporal particle interactions and microstructure evolution. ...|$|R

It is a complex process governed by the precise chemistry of the ores and leaching solution, the biological action of bacteria that live on the rocks, and the multiphase fluid flow through and around the rocks. In order to improve the predication of recovery {{and the performance of}} the operations, a better understanding of all aspects is vital. Several studies have suggested the importance of the fluid flow and mass transport within the heaps. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method has a proven track record of simulating saturated flows at very small scales for porous media and is a natural tool for gaining an insight into the flows within packed beds. In this thesis we present developments to the handling of wall boundaries in SPH with an aim towards handling arbitrary geometries and improving accuracy. As well as considering the inclusion of surface tension and contact angles for simulating unsaturated flows. A volume factor correction for curved boundaries is developed that demonstrably improves accuracy of simulations, as well as detailing a ‘boundary integral method’ for including wall boundaries. The developed SPH simulation code is used to run a variety of unsteady unsaturated simulations through 2 D packed beds, including the effects of molecular diffusion. These simulations demonstrate the important roles that saturation and capillarity play in packed beds, with unsaturated flows having enhanced transport coefficients as compared to higher saturations. These simulations also serve to highlight the fact that even at relatively long time scales, {{from the perspective of the}} flow, that the transport is not in the simple Fickian regime, which is often used when modelling heaps and other packed beds at a larger scale.

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{a considerable amount of}} scandium in lateritic nickel-cobalt ores necessitates the investigation of possible processing alternatives to recover scandium as a byproduct during nickel and cobalt production. Therefore, in this study, rather than interfering with the main nickel-cobalt production circuit, the precipitation-separation behavior of scandium during a pH-controlled precipitation process from a synthetically prepared solution was investigated to adopt the Sc recovery circuit into an already existing <b>hydrometallurgical</b> nickel-cobalt hydroxide <b>processing</b> plant. The composition of the synthetic solution was determined according to the hydrometallurgical nickel laterite ore processing streams obtained from a HPAL (high-pressure sulphuric acid leaching) process. In order to selectively precipitate and concentrate scandium with minimum nickel and cobalt co-precipitation, the pH of the solution was adjusted by CaCO 3, MgO, Na 2 CO 3, and NaOH. It was found that precipitation with MgO or Na 2 CO 3 is more advantageous to obtain a precipitate containing higher amounts of scandium with minimum mass when compared to the CaCO 3 route, which makes further processing more viable. As a result of this study, it is proposed that by a simple pH-controlled precipitation process, scandium can be separated from the nickel and cobalt containing process solutions as a byproduct without affecting the conventional nickel-cobalt hydroxide production.

40|$|Manganese is an {{important}} metal {{for the maintenance of}} several biological functions, but it can be toxic in high concentrations. One of the main forms of human exposure to metals, such as manganese (Mn), is the consumption of solar salt contaminated. Mn-tolerant bacteria could be used to decrease the concentration of this metal from contaminated sites through safer environmental-friendly alternative technology in the future. Therefore, this study was undertaken to isolate and identify Mn resistant bacteria from water samples collected from a Mn mine in the Iron Quadrangle region (Minas Gerais, Brazil). Two bacterial isolates were identified as Serratia marcescens based on morphological, biochemical, 16 S rDNA gene sequencing and phylogeny analysis. Maximum resistance of the selected isolates against increasing concentrations of Mn(II), up to 1200 mg L- 1 was determined in solid media. A batch assay was developed to analyze and quantify the Mn removal capacities of the isolates. Biological Mn removal capacities of over 55 % were detected for both isolates. Whereas that mechanism like biosorption, precipitation and oxidation could be explaining the Mn removal, we seek to give an insight into some of the molecular mechanisms adopted by S. marcescens isolates. For this purpose, the following approaches were adopted: leucoberbelin blue I assay, Mn(II) oxidation by cell-free filtrate and electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses. Overall, these results indicate that S. marcescens promotes Mn removal in an indirect mechanism by the formation of Mn oxides precipitates around the cells, which should be further explored for potential biotechnological applications for water recycling both in <b>hydrometallurgical</b> and mineral <b>processing</b> operations...|$|R

40|$|Nickel matte is {{a nickel}} sulfide {{concentrate}} produced by smelting. It consists mainly of two components: a nickel-copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni 3 S 2); but also contains varying amounts of djurleite, Cu 1. 96 S. There are several <b>hydrometallurgical</b> routes for <b>processing</b> nickel matte. The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid chloride or sulfate solution. Nickel is subsequently recovered fiom the leach solution by electrowinning or by hydrogen reduction. In the work {{described in this}} thesis, {{various aspects of the}} acid leaching of nickel matte are investigated using mostly electrochemical methods. The first section concerns the use of copper(II) as an oxidant for the alloy component of nickel matte. In this cementation reaction, nickel goes into solution while copper is deposited on the dissolving metal swf 8 ce. The same reaction is important in removing traces of copper present in the nickel solution. Here nickel powder is added to the process liquor. A survey of the literature pertaining to the cementation of copper by nickel shows that there is considerable dispute as to the conditions under which cementation takes place. Evans' diagrams for the cementation reaction were constructed by superimposing the polarisation curves for the oxidation of nickel and the reduction of copper. It was found that cementation occurred provided that the two polarisation curves intersected in the region of active nickel dissolution. Outside this region, a copper deposit could not be seen. The second part of the thesis presents some investigations into the electrochemistry of nickel sulfides and nickel matte, and compares both chloride and sulfate media. Oxidation and dissolution rates of nickel matte powders using copper(I 1) as an oxidant were also carried out. Dissolution was chemically controlled and so the rate was very dependent upon temperature and solution potential. Displacement of copper(II) from solution to form copper sulfide was also found to be important. In addition to the above studies, which relate directly to the oxidative leaching of nickel matte, an investigation of the oxidation of HzS to sulfur in acidic solution was carried out. Sulfer deposition was found to be strongly dependent on substrate and pH. Under some conditions, two types of sulfur were deposited, with the more crystalline sulfer being reduced at the more negative potential...|$|R
