5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the rage of the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E

A body is found in the Thames by Gaffer Hexam, a waterman who makes his living by {{retrieving}} corpses and robbing them of valuables, before handing them over to the authorities. Papers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of the drowned man identify him as the heir, John Harmon. Present at the identification is a mysterious young man, who gives his name as Julius Handford and then disappears.|$|E
50|$|The {{other thing}} they do is to listen out to hear how {{the sound of their}} playing merges with the {{metronome}} to create a new sound when you play precisely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> with <b>the</b> metronome. By listening in this way (and through other exercises) it is possible to play precisely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> with <b>the</b> metronome <b>in</b> a relaxed fashion. At the same time as they work on playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> they also work on flexibility and the ability to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same precise way anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beat.|$|R

25|$|Moro {{was wearing}} the same grey clothes he had during the kidnapping. The cravat had several blood stains, traces of sand were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> and socks, and traces of {{vegetables}} were also found. Eventually the terrorists declared that they had intentionally added those traces in order to sidetrack the investigators. In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and his watch, and some spent cartridges. Moro had also a wound at the thigh, likely suffered during the initial assault in via Fani.|$|E
25|$|For all of {{the sound}} common sense that Illingworth had {{demonstrated}} {{as a player and}} reinforced as a commentator, his abrasive man-management style appeared out of date by 1994. Examples of this were his readiness to speak to the media to criticise his own players, as he did twice with Mike Atherton: firstly during the dirt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> scandal in 1994 and later the same year during the Melbourne Test match. Illingworth also engaged in a public argument with Devon Malcolm just after Malcolm had produced a rather wayward burst of bowling in the fifth test of the 1995–96 South African series, which saw a long 10th wicket stand that effectively cost England the match.|$|E
500|$|Many constituencies, {{especially}} those with small electorates, were {{under the control of}} rich landowners, and were known as nomination boroughs or pocket boroughs, because they were said to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of their patrons. Most patrons were noblemen or landed gentry who could use their local influence, prestige, and wealth to sway the voters. This was particularly true in rural counties, and in small boroughs situated near a large landed estate. Some noblemen even controlled multiple constituencies: for example, the Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven, while the Earl of Lonsdale controlled nine. Writing in 1821, Sydney Smith proclaimed that [...] "The country belongs to the Duke of Rutland, Lord Lonsdale, the Duke of Newcastle, and about twenty other holders of boroughs. They are our masters!" [...] T. H. B. Oldfield claimed in his Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland that, out of the 514 members representing England and Wales, about 370 were selected by nearly 180 patrons. A member who represented a pocket borough was expected to vote as his patron ordered, or else lose his seat at the next election.|$|E

500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 1998, the EPB {{published}} {{a press release}} claiming responsibility for {{an attack on a}} facility housing machinery and equipment being used to build the Superaqueduct, one of the Roselló administration's flagship projects. The organization informed that two of its Special Military Units, identified by the names [...] "Manolo el Leñero" [...] and [...] "Francisco Pachín Marín", infiltrated the locale during the previous night. The EPB cited that the government had been working on the project during nighttime, despite the existence of a case in the Appellation Circuit emitted an opinion stating that it lacked proper permits from several agencies including the Department of Natural Resources and that it violated zoning and construction laws, as the justification for their actions. Referring to the Roselló administration as a [...] "political mafia", the organization stated that the government acted [...] "in a dictatorial manner" [...] by [...] "disrespecting the Puerto Rican courts, with no hesitance" [...] and [...] "ignoring the positive and economic alternatives proposed by legitimate defenders of the environment [...] to satisfy the economic interests of private developers." [...] The EPB further argued that the large investment in this and other projects [...] "would end <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of corrupt" [...] individuals, predicting that a portion of it would be used to fund the PNP's political campaign and its lobbyists in Washington. The organization made argued that the environmental damage to the central region and Lago Dos Bocas would be irreparable, also criticizing that the water was only being redirected to the metropolitan area. The group cited local scientists opposed to the Superaqueduct by stating that the effect would also affect Río Grande estuary and the natural reserve of Caño Tiburones in Arecibo, besides offering a subpar quality of water that could endanger the public health. The EPB also expressed concern in the competentcy of those manning the machinery, claiming that it could endanger the safety of children, concluding that these actions formed part of an initiative of [...] "policy of National Salvation" [...] that intended to protect sectors of the general public and workers of entities that the Roselló administration intended to privatize, such as the Puerto Rico Telephone Company. Los Macheteros claimed responsibility for an explosion at a small power station in the San Juan metropolitan area. The explosion caused limited power outages.|$|E

2500|$|Tonsilloliths or tonsil {{stones are}} calcifications that {{form in the}} crypts of the palatal tonsils. They are also known to form in the throat and {{on the roof of}} the mouth. Tonsils are filled with crevices where {{bacteria}} and other materials, including dead cells and mucus, can become trapped. When this occurs, the debris can become concentrated in white formations that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets.</b> Tonsilloliths are formed when this trapped debris accumulates and are expressed from the tonsil. They are generally soft, sometimes rubbery. This tends to occur most often in people who suffer from chronic inflammation in their tonsils or repeated bouts of tonsillitis. They are often associated with post-nasal drip.|$|E
