40|$|Observations {{with radio}} telescopes address key {{problems}} in cosmology, astrobiology, heliophysics, and planetary science {{including the first}} light in the Universe (Cosmic Dawn), magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, particle acceleration mechanisms, and the lunar ionosphere. The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the <b>driven</b> <b>roller.</b> The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} <b>driven</b> <b>roller.</b> Springs preload the passive roller against the <b>driven</b> <b>roller,</b> and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool. The antenna deployment mechanism is integrated on the minimally-actuated Axel rover. Axel is a two-wheeled rover platform with a trailing boom that is capable of traversing undulated terrain and overcoming obstacles of a wheel radius in height. It is operated by four motors: one that drives each wheel; a third that controls the rotation of the boom, which orients the body mounted sensors; and a fourth that controls the rover's spool to drive the antenna roller. This low-mass axle-like rover houses its control and communication avionics inside its cylindrical body. The Axel rover teleoperation software has an auto-spooling mode that allows a user to automatically deploy the thin-film antenna at a rate proportional to the wheel speed as it drives the rover along its trajectory. The software allows Axel to deposit the film onto the ground to prevent or minimize relative motion between the film and the terrain to avoid the risk of scraping and antenna with the terrain...|$|E

30|$|Several factors {{shape the}} tension control design to be challenging, which include {{significant}} parameter variations and disturbances. Small {{variations in the}} change of velocity of the transport rollers can cause significant variations in tension. On the other hand, we used different shapes of mandrels for maintaining the line speed in acceleration or deceleration states. Because of the coupling between the tension and the line speed, {{it is difficult to}} maintain the tension at a desired value. Researchers have investigated considerably for acquiring better control result. Lee et al. [2] used a magneto rheological brake to provide back tension to prevent frequent part changes and fatal malfunction for a tension control system, and a PID controller was designed, and test results showed the feasibility with satisfying the time constant and the allowable error. Nishida et al. [3] divided the transport system into several subsystems and a self-tuning PI controller with an estimator based on a novel adaptive particle swarm optimization method was constructed to solve the strong coupling between the velocity and tension of the web. A self-tuning PID controller to control the tension for tape winding of composites was designed and the constant extension ratio is guaranteed. To reduce the time required for the stabilization of the tension, a faststabilization method [4] for web tension is proposed. The model of dancer system and stabilization of web tension in drying process are established, and the variation of tension is used as a reference value for the tension stabilization. The integration of load cells and active dancer system for printed electronics applications was used to improve the accuracy of web tension, and self-adapting neural network control was proposed to reduce tension spikes due to the change in roll diameter of winder and unwinder rolls. Wu et al. [5] developed a tension detection and control mechanism and analyzed the main causes of wire tension variation, and then a PI algorithm was proposed to reduce tension variation. An accurate dynamic model for the unwind roll by considering the time variation of the roll inertia and radius was developed, and a decentralized controller for computing the equilibrium inputs for each <b>driven</b> <b>roller</b> was proposed [6]. A sliding mode control with guaranteed cost technique [7] was applied for reducing the system uncertainties. The simulation results showed that the proposed method had good robustness and quick response time. Compensation method [8] by calculating the torque of a driven loop lifter was developed to control the tension and thickness of hot-rolled strip. For the control strategy, several control methods have been proposed including disturbance rejection control [9 – 12], neuro-fuzzy control [13 – 16], and H∞ control [17 – 19]. Choi et al. [20] conducted a survey on various types of control algorithms by investigating their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrated some areas of potential future development.|$|E

30|$|Filament winding {{has emerged}} as the main process for carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) fabrication, and tension control {{plays a key role in}} enhancing the quality of the winding products. With the continuous improvement of product quality and efficiency, the precision of the tension control system is constantly improving. In this paper, a novel tension control method is proposed, which can regulate the fiber tension and transport speed of the winding process by governing the outputs of three different <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> (the torque of the unwind roll, the torque of the magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller) in three levels. The mechanical structures and dynamic models of the <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> and idle rollers are established by considering the time-varying features of the roller radius and inertia. Moreover, the influence of parameters and speed variation on fiber tension is investigated using the increment model. Subsequently, the control method is proposed by applying fiber tension in three levels according to the features of the three <b>driven</b> <b>rollers.</b> An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for tuning the PID parameters online to control the speed of the master speed roller. Simulation is conducted for verifying the performance and stability of the proposed tension control method by comparing with those of the conventional PID control method. The result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed, and the proposed system is applied to a winding machine. The performance and stability of the tension control system are demonstrated via a series of experiments using carbon fiber under different reference speeds and tensions. This paper proposes a novel tension control method to regulate the fiber tension and transport speed.|$|R

In this paper, a novel tension control method is presented, which can regulate the tension and speed of the filament winding process. The mechanical structure and dynamic model of the system are established, and the influences of the parameter and the speed variation on fiber tension are examined. Subsequently, according to the features of <b>driven</b> <b>rollers</b> and the influence of variation, the control method is proposed by regulating the outputs of the torque of unwind roll, the torque of magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed roller in three levels. Simulations are conducted for verifying the effect by comparing the results with those of the conventional PID controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed control system is verified through experimental studies using a filament winding machine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Deformation {{of round}} {{castings}} due to thermal and/or mechanical strain {{may lead to}} the occurrence of their ovality defects during continuous casting. Presently, ovality defect from thermal deformation have been effectively controlled in actual casting process with the application of more advanced equipments and more sophisticated control strategies. But the control of ovality defect from larger mechanical deformation still cannot satisfy the need of caster design or higher qualified rate of castings. It is shown that excessive hot pressure while strand passes through tension leveler, is the main reason to generate larger mechanical deformation. With consideration of the characteristics of round caster and the requirement of safety production, a theoretical calculated model based on mechanical deformation analysis has been developed in the paper to eliminate ovality defect specially from the over large hot pressure. Calculation analysis suggests that groove design of <b>drive</b> <b>roller</b> and range of round section sizes should be the important consideration for the determination of hot pressure, and there always exists an optimum value for hot pressure when the machine equipments of round caster have been designed and installed. The model can provide a useful guideline for casting engineers to design the groove of <b>drive</b> <b>roller</b> and to determine reasonable safe hot pressure. Reliability of the model analysis has been verified by industrial application on a newly built round caster...|$|R
