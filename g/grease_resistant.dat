50|$|Glassine is {{a smooth}} and glossy paper that is air, water and <b>grease</b> <b>resistant.</b> It is usually {{available}} in densities between 50-90 g/m2. It is translucent unless dyes {{are added to}} color it or make it opaque. It is manufactured by supercalendering: after pressing and drying, the paper web is passed through a stack of alternating steel and fiber-covered rolls called a supercalender {{at the end of}} the paper machine such that the paper fibres flatten facing in the same direction.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{commercial}} {{developments have}} created a need for alternative materials and methods for imparting oil/grease resistance to paper and/or paperboard used in packaging. The performance of a novel <b>grease</b> <b>resistant</b> functional coating comprised of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium tetraborate pentahydrate (borate) and acetonedicarboxylic acid (ACDA) {{and the application of}} said coating by means of flexographic press is presented herein. Application criteria is developed, testing procedures described, and performance assessment of the developed coating materials are made. SEM images along with contact angle data suggest that coating performance is probably attributable to decreased mean pore size in conjunction with a slightly increased surface contact angle facilitated by crosslinking of PVA molecules by both borate ions and ACDA...|$|E
40|$|Recycled {{cellulosic}} paperboards {{may include}} mineral oils after the recycle process, which {{together with their}} poor water resistance limit their use as food packaging materials. In this work, we demonstrate that a proper functionalization of the recycled paper with two successive polymer treatments, imposes a mineral oil migration barrier and simultaneously renders it waterproof and <b>grease</b> <b>resistant,</b> making it an ideal material for food contact. The first poly (methyl methacrylate) treatment penetrates the paper network and creates a protective layer around every fiber, permitting thus {{the transformation of the}} paperboard to a hydrophobic material throughout its thickness, reducing {{at the same time the}} mineral oil migration. Subsequently, the second layer with a cyclic olefin copolymer fills the open pores of the surface, and reduces the mineral oil hydrocarbons migration at levels below those proposed by the BMEL. Online liquid chromatographyâ€“gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection quantitatively demonstrate that this dual functional treatment prevents the migration of both saturated (mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons) and aromatic hydrocarbon (mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons) mineral oils from the recycled paperboard to a dry food simulant...|$|E
50|$|This pencil {{is usually}} made from {{non-toxic}} opaque wax {{similar to a}} crayon but stronger. Marks made by <b>grease</b> pencils are <b>resistant</b> to moisture and can usually be removed by rubbing the marked surface with a paper towel.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] have {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over traditional paper made from wood pulp. Stone Paper collects no static charge, is acid-free with a neutral pH, has no grain, is water, <b>grease,</b> and insect <b>resistant,</b> and tears with difficulty due to a latex-like texture.|$|R
