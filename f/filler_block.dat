The true reason for the shows 30-minute airing extension is because ABS-CBN was forced to permanently shelve the premiere of the third season of Kurokos Basketball (also edited by the network, as well) due to the Kapamilya Blockbusters non-anime <b>filler</b> movie <b>block,</b> initially used as a last-minute adjustment to allow Game 7 of the NBA Finals be broadcast live.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, a {{membrane}} {{with low}} methanol permeability, high proton conductivity, and high selectivity was successfully prepared through the simple technique {{known as the}} blending method. The presence of sulfonated graphene oxide enhanced {{the properties of the}} alginate-based polymer membrane in terms of proton conductivity and methanol permeability. The sulfonate groups facilitated the networking between the alginate polymer and the graphene oxide <b>filler.</b> The <b>blocking</b> effect of SGO also reduced the methanol crossover in the membrane. The primary weaknesses of the alginate polymer, which are its mechanical properties of tensile strength and elongation at break, were also improved by the addition of SGO into the polymer matrix.

40|$|A {{new type}} of proton-conducting hybrid {{membranes}} were prepared by in situ cross-linking of a mixture of polymerizable oils containing protic ionic liquids (PILs) and silica nanoparticles or mesoporous silica nanospheres. The resultant hybrid membranes are semitransparent, flexible, and show good thermal stability, good and tunable mechanical properties. Incorporation of proper amount of silica fillers significantly increased, the proton conductivity of the membranes, {{probably due to the}} ion transport channel or network structures formed in the membranes. However, further addition of silica <b>fillers</b> might <b>block</b> the formed, ion transport, channels and decrease the conductivity of hybrid membranes. Compared with silica nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanospheres is more effective in enhancing the conductivity and in preventing the release of ionic liquid component from the composite membranes. Under anhydrous conditions, the produced hybrid membranes show proton conductivity up to the order of 1 x 10 - 2 S/cm at 160 °C.

40|$|Structural {{studies of}} filled polymer {{networks}} under periodic deformation are {{of great importance}} to the industries concerned with rubber. The degree of reinforcement provided by the filler depends {{on a number of}} variables: the size of the polymer-filler interface, the size of primary particles, {{the size and shape of}} filler clusters. In the tyre industry it is necessary to optimize mechanical properties such as low rolling resistance, good wet grip and long lifetime. There have been studies of unfilled polymer networks and <b>filler</b> model-systems (<b>block</b> copolymers),([1, 2]) but because their complexity, industrial rubber samples have escaped investigations. We performed SAXS, USAXS and SANS measurements on carbon black filled natural rubber (poly-isoprene) under uniaxial deformation at ESRF ID- 02 and Forschungszentrum Julich KWS- 2. The scattering patterns of the studied filler particles show power-law decay over many decades in scattering vector q. At the scale of primary particles we detected surface fractal behavior and for the characteristic size of the primary particles we calculated lengths of the order of 10 nm.

40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and water blocking material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water blocking of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking. To address these new challenges, new water blocking materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures. The new materials included a thin water blocking tape for use in power conductors, a new high-capacity water blocking yarn designed for use in conductors and two new water <b>blocking</b> <b>filler</b> yarns designed {{for use in the}} interstitial areas between conductors in LV and MV multicore cables In addition, methods were developed to analyze power cable geometry and produce an estimated bill of materials for water blocking.

Conclusion: The glass bead thermal insulation concrete frame structure of fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete <b>block</b> <b>filler</b> wall meets the requirement of Sichuan residential building energy-saving code. China is the biggest coal producing and consumptive country. Recently, with the steady development of energy industries, the fly ash produced by coal increased annually, resulting in serious environmental pollution and stress to economics.

40|$|Lead is a heavy-metal element {{well known}} to be {{hazardous}} to both {{human health and the}} environment. This chapter sets forth requirements for protecting workers from lead. Chapters 40, “Hazardous Materials”, 1 and 17, “Hazardous Waste”, 2 cover the use and disposal of it. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts The presence of lead in human blood can cause damage to and reduce the number of red blood cells, leading to a condition known as anemia. Lead also interferes with the transmission of nerve impulses, resulting in damage to hearing, thinking, sense of touch, and muscle control. Our bodies store lead in the bones as if it were calcium, and it is therefore eliminated very slowly, with a biologic half-life estimated between 10 to 20 years. Because excretion is slow, accumulation in the body occurs readily. Lead also reacts with oxygen to produce lead oxides. While pure lead is a heavy and solid material, lead oxides are powdery and easily released into the environment. Lead oxide dust from lead shielding and contaminated pallets or surfaces can be harmful to humans even with a short exposure. 1. 1. 1 Exposure Sources Lead is present at SLAC chiefly in three forms: 1. Radiation shielding The most likely source of lead exposure at SLAC is through the handling of lead for radiation shielding. Rough handling of the lead shielding can cause surface dust to be released into the air. 2. Radiation shielding <b>filler</b> When shielding <b>blocks</b> are moved, legacy lead (see Section 4, “Definitions”) from oxidized lead shot or matting can crumble into smaller fragments, leading to the potential release of lead dust, which can then be accidentally inhaled or digested...|$|R

This dissertation highlights new methodologies and formulation approaches {{to improve the}} performance of siloxane polymers, including the mechanical properties, surface properties, optical properties and transport properties. It also provides an in-depth understanding about dip-coating deposition on chemically patterned surfaces. The first chapter presents the process of transforming sand into siloxane polymers of excellent mechanical strength. History, properties and applications of siloxane polymers are systematically discussed. Another focus of this chapter is wetting, including the concepts of contact angles and capillary bridge ruptures. Five interconnected projects are discussed following the introduction. Base-catalyzed siloxane equilibration is fully utilized {{in the first and}} second projects. First, extremely stretchable silicone elastomers are prepared by copolymerizing silica particles and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane with siloxane equilibration. It is demonstrated that Stöber silica particles can actively participate in the chemical cross-linking of linear PDMS, serving as SiO 4 linking group reservoirs. Second, permanently hydrophilic silicones are obtained by grafting PEO-PDMS copolymers to cross-linked silicones via siloxane equilibration. High power light-emitting diodes require a transparent encapsulant of high refractive index and low water permeability. The third project concerns the uniform incorporation of high refractive index inorganic fillers into siloxane polymers. Silicone composites with tailored refractive indices, different molecular structures, tunable mechanical properties and excellent transparency are achieved via sol-gel chemistry. In the fourth project, the high water transport rate in pure silicone is clarified, for both linear and cross-linked silicones. This high water transport rate results from the special structural features of silicone. Incorporation of water-resistant coating layers, silanized <b>fillers</b> and polyimide <b>blocks</b> are shown to be several effective approaches to decrease the water permeability of silicones. The fifth project deals with dip-coating deposition on chemically patterned surfaces. The mechanisms of capillary bridge deformation and rupture for dip-coating deposition on chemically and topographically patterned surfaces are compared. Ordered inorganic and organic individual crystal arrays are successfully patterned on smooth and chemically patterned surfaces prepared by photolithography...|$|R
40|$|Soil was {{a popular}} {{building}} material in Sri Lanka with many indigenous construction techniques. Although there were many houses constructed with soil based materials in the ancient times, burnt clay bricks and cement blocks have overtaken the indigenous walling materials in the recent past. However, with the prevailing sand crisis and environmental problems associated with modem construction methods, stabilized earth has been again introduced to Sri Lanka with some technological advancement. With extensive researches carried out on compressed stabilized earth blocks and rammed earth, the strength characteristics of both these materials were proven adequate for load bearing masonry construction. Recently, however it has been {{thought that it would}} be architecturally desirable to leave earth walls without any exterior coating, and this has given rise to questions on long-term resistance to driving rain. The research presented in this thesis was organized and aimed at assessing the durability properties of various forms of stabilized earth constructions and to develop improvements with cost effective paints and/or plasters. In order to achieve the above objectives, the following methodology was adopted. Firstly, a detailed literature review was carried out to investigate the durability enhancement techniques that have been successfully adopted for earth construction in Sri Lanka and other countries. Secondly, a field survey was carried out to identify durability problems with earth buildings already constructed in Sri Lanka. The wall panels were constructed out of compressed stabilized earth blocks and rammed earth to carry out the durability testing, specified in the relevant Codes of Practices and Earth Building Standards. Different paints and plasters were applied on earth wall panels and accelerated durability testing was conducted on panels with erosion test apparatus. The durability improvements suggested in this study includes provision of long eaves, adequate stabilization levels, suitable protective coatings and strategies to minimize shrinkage that can be applied in the design and construction stages. Such measures will certainly ensure more durable structures built with stabilized earth as a walling material. However, areas subjected to flooding needs special care in terms of durability. Therefore, special designs should be introduced for the houses built in such locations. The study revealed that 5 % cement can be recommended as the optimum in terms of durability aspects. Using durability testings, different surface coatings were assessed for durability aspects. It was found that best combination is cement plaster and emulsion or weather shield paint. The coatings like mud paint on a plaster and Acrylic <b>filler</b> directly on <b>blocks</b> can be recommended in relatively dry areas or for walls adequately protected by eaves. Thus, it can be stated that walls constructed with cement stabilized earth blocks or rammed earth can be either kept exposed with a suitable paint based protection or applied with a plaster of minimum thickness. The machine made blocks allow attractive finish even without plastering and hence allow reaching one of the key goals in sustainable construction of minimizing the use of natural resources. Key words: earth buildings, durability, stabilizatio...|$|R
5000|$|Licensed to Belle Glade, it {{was called}} 'The Mighty Ninety' (the same as its sister station WEAS in Savannah, Georgia) for many years since most radios of the time dropped the last zero of the frequency. [...] "Dee" [...] Rivers, the owner, was very clever in having a station at 900 kHz in Savannah and WSWN at 900 kHz in Belle Glade, with {{somewhat}} overlapping patterns. After it won FCC approval {{to go to a}} 24-hour broadcast schedule it became known as the [...] "Little Station with the Long Reach" [...] for its ability to be heard as far away as Charleston and Mobile from dusk till dawn. This, despite the fact that its 1,000-watt signal could scarcely be heard in West Palm Beach during the day. Over the years attempts at raising power were blocked due to signal overlap issues with a station on the same frequency in Ocala. With its fate virtually sealed as a local-only station during the day, the 1970s saw even its nighttime listenership erode with the emergence of country music powerhouses like WQAM & WIRK. But with a devout local following and a niche Southern Gospel morning show, management/ownership stubbornly clung to the country format even though the demographic was at least 65 percent black. Finally, in the 1980s longtime owner Rivers Broadcasting relented and an experienced black PD named Joe Fisher was permitted to change the format to what was then referred to as R&B, with a strong emphasis on Black Gospel. But for only 18 hours a day! The station would retain its Southern Gospel morning show. Rivers' station in Savannah, GA had been R&B from the late 1940s until 1960, when it changed to a country music format. This station also played late evening R&B hosted and DJ by [...] "Nat The Cat" [...] He played a variety R&B music of the eighties. His segment and time slot were affectionally known as Nat The Cat and Hot Butter Soul. He was known to the community as the First Black DEE JAY Of the Glades. Many have tried to leave this part of history out of this radio station. Since the early 1960s its beloved host had been Jimmy Sims a homespun, American Gospel type character from Alabama who had previously enjoyed success at a station in DeFuniak Springs. By the 1980s he had become known to many as Reverend Sims, though he was never formally ordained. Sims actually had a significant following among blacks, but there were those who resented the half-hearted attempt by ownership at addressing that community. In this difficult environment the new PD positioned WSWN with the moniker: 'Sugar 900' (pronounced Suga900), a reference to the number one industry in the Glades, sugarcane farming and processing. He managed to craft a slick package including professional imaging and good talent that at times sounded world-class! Additionally, the all-important weekend (and especially Sunday Morning) programming had been left open for Black Gospel. This was something of a [...] "cash cow" [...] thanks to ministries both near and far anxious to purchase air-time. Meanwhile, Belle Glade's FM frequency (93.5), purchased by Rivers in 1965 and left dark for over a decade (Mr. Rivers had {{toyed with the idea of}} broadcasting a signal to be heard in Cuba, but the radiation pattern was too small) was being prepared to assume the Country format. Power was 10,000 watts broadcast from a 420 ft. tower, the maximum permitted due to its close proximity to an airport and overlap issues with similar frequencies in Vero Beach and Key Largo. Once again, a Belle Glade station was relegated to [...] "local-only" [...] status. It was clear that the new station (WSWN-FM) would struggle to find its place, but 'Sugar 900' (WSWN) reached new heights. However, within 2 or 3 years Fisher was allegedly struck down by the crack cocaine epidemic and the station foundered under his less than attentive direction. A succession of replacements including self-styled program consultants, fresh faced Connecticut School of Broadcasting graduates and Phil Haire's own daughter tried their hand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All sunk to new lows in programming. In fact, Tammy Haire may have pulled one of the all time blunders in this market when, as acting GM in her father's absence, she switched the FM's format to Soft Hits. This virtually dropped the Country format into the lap of competing station WAFC in Clewiston. And since white listeners in the south Lake Okeechobee area listen almost exclusively to country music, one is left to wonder what she had in mind. She also incurred the wrath of ownership when she made nearly $35,000.00 in improvements to the studios at WSWN-FM (now WBGF). Nonetheless Phil Haire was welcomed back by his old friend Marie, the widowed owner of Rivers (now Seminole Broadcasting), when his cancer battle was over. He quickly validated her faith by automating WBGF. Arrangements were made to carry programming via satellite from Jones Radio Networks for a very reasonable $250.00 per station per month. Of course an up-front investment of around $10,000 in computer automation equipment was needed, but payroll would immediately be reduced by at least fifty percent! Then, ignoring traditional format constraints he began selling blocks of airtime to any and all comers. Suddenly, the listed format (Gospel, Country, etc.) became nothing more than <b>filler</b> for <b>blocks</b> that remained unsold. While such a move repulses programming purists, it was actually quite savvy. With the only considerations now involving decency things like unfortunate format changes and declining sound quality seem irrelevant. Infomercials, broadcast ministries, political messages, agency media, sponsored events. These weren't new to radio, but their wholesale inclusion was. Brilliant in the minds of ownership! Infuriating to the mainstream listener. In one swoop Haire had slashed payroll (with the promise of more to come), completely eliminated programming positions and helped pioneer a new business model for small struggling station owners. Even larger stations in metropolitan areas have since employed similar programming with the internet, iPod and satellite taking ever larger portions of the pie. By 1996 both stations had been on the block for several years and Marie Rivers was anxious to retire. She accepted an offer made by 2 partners from New York calling themselves Atlas News & Information Service, Inc. David Lampel was the hands-on [...] "radio man" [...] who had worked his way to PD and later GM at WLIB in New York City then to Senior Vice President of the station's parent, Inner City Broadcasting Corporation. Michael Wach was a sales and administration specialist with connections, and had served as vice president and general manager of WLNY-TV on Long Island and held executive positions with WPIX-TV in New York and Boston's WHDH-TV. Together, they had already purchased a television station and several radio stations in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Now WBGF/WSWN would be united with a 100,000 watt FM in Isla Morada under the name BGI Broadcasting. Their first move was to flip WBGF-FM to the Hot New Country format offered by Jones Radio, call it 'Big Dawg Country' and launch a live/local morning show. The WSWN format remained largely untouched. But the axe finally fell on the air staff. Henceforth, 6P-6A would be satellite automated featuring the Urban Gold format from ABC Networks. Saturday was live Gospel from 6-10AM, then automated until Sunday when live Gospel aired from 6A to at least 6P, and sometimes later depending on how much airtime had been sold. The patented Phil Haire method was embraced. In fact it was given new life with the prospect of offering customers more coverage via simulcast to other properties. And even hobbled, with failing health in his late seventies, Haire was a formidable sales tool with connections that reached to Tallahassee, and beyond. Besides he was something of a local icon with a colorful past, referred to by many as the 'Glades Radio Boss'. In 1998 Michael Wach sold his interest in Atlas News & Information Service to become vice president and general manager at WNYW/FOX 5 TV in New York, the Fox Network's flagship station. This left Lampel as majority shareholder, if not outright owner. Since he had directed operations thus far anyway there were no new changes, just forward progress. More employees were dismissed until, by 1999 the entire staff (including part-time) consisted of only 7 or 8 individuals. And there was about to be one less. By 2000 the decision was made to swap studios. That is to say, the more successful WSWN would be moved from its cramped hovel with archaic equipment to the much larger state-of-the-art WBGF-FM studio that had been improved years before. The perennially strapped FM would now rightfully occupy the less prominent quarters in the back of the same building. While one might assume WSWN personnel to be jubilant over this new development, it actually became a source of contention between management and one of South Florida's longest-running on-air personalities, Jimmy Sims. For years Sims had battled a variety of ailments including severe arthritis that left him with gnarled digits and painful joints. He was physically unable to stand for long periods at the much higher console in the former FM studio. When the counter-height chairs that had been provided still complicated his condition, ownership was unmoved and offered no further compromise. Sims faded from the airwaves. The inevitable wave of complaints from loyal listeners and the threat of a lawsuit under the Americans With Disabilities Act changed nothing. His long 38-year association with broadcasting in the Glades came to an unceremonious end. The stations are still owned by Atlas News & Information Svc/BGI Broadcasting (now headquartered in Las Vegas). WSWN remains a Gospel station, but WBGF has switched to a Mexican Regional format and now calls itself 'Radio Lobo'. Phil Haire died in April 2006. By all accounts he remained GM and checked in daily right up to the last week of his life. Current Station Manager is Mike D'Augustine.|$|R
