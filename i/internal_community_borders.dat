40|$|Almost exactly {{five years}} after it issued its {{pioneering}} rulings Kohll and Decker, the European court of justice has taken another step in opening <b>internal</b> <b>community</b> <b>borders</b> for patients. In its final judgement in the cases Müller-Fauré and Van Riet (C- 385 / 99), the judges of Luxembourg ruled that the condition of prior authorisation for ambulatory cross-border care is not justified.

40|$|Cross-border {{cooperation}} in Europe has evolved {{through a series}} of bottom-up initiatives, undertaken, since the late 50 s, by many local and regional authorities at the European <b>Community</b> <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> These initiatives have {{led to the creation of}} over 130 Euroregions, with a large variety of organizational structures and operational strengths. The development of EU regional policy, especially in connection with the Eastern enlargement, has encouraged Member States and EU institutions to create a common institutional framework under EU law. This was done with Regulation 1082 / 2006 that established the EGTC. In this article we look first of all to the new possibilities that the EGTC may offer to the Euroregions, but also to the limits of that legal instrument. Hence we analyze three relevant general dimensions: the nature of EGTC identity (polycentric vs. monocentric); the size of the EGTC cross-border areas (small vs. big size; regional vs. local partners); and the functions of the EGTC (strategic and/or implement:alive functions). Then we discuss the possible transformation of the Alps Adriatic Working Community, a loose structure created in 1978 in a very different socio-economic context, in an EGTC, looking in particular at. the national enforcement provisions of the EGTC Regulation in Italy, Austria and Slovenia and their respective advantages and disadvantages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Organizational {{ambidexterity}} {{still remains}} ambiguous {{in terms of}} the concept and vague in terms of feasible realizations, especially for SMEs. We analyze recent classifications of the concept and focus on cyclical ambidexterity as the appropriate means for SMEs to manage the tension between incremental and discontinuous innovation effectively. We argue that cyclical ambidexterity should be understood as a sequence and interplay of quality management processes and <b>internal</b> <b>communities</b> for open innovation. By applying the methodological approach of action research, we investigate an implementation of such an approach to cyclical ambidexterity at Hofmann Personal. The findings confirm our framework of social and technological design elements of <b>internal</b> <b>communities</b> for open innovation. ...|$|R
