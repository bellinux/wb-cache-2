50|$|There were {{no records}} of fires by urban {{community}} or territorial division (bailliage or sénéchaussée in France). Yet their accuracy {{should be put}} in perspective: the provinces did not stop asking the central government for revisions, always for reduction, due to famine or epidemic. The total number of fires was therefore subject to hard bargaining between the central government and municipalities, regardless of the reality on the ground. In addition, the poorest families were grouped at the parish level as a single fire for <b>joint</b> <b>taxation.</b> This led to rounded off counts cut off from reality.|$|E
5000|$|Most Western {{countries}} have abolished mandatory income splitting, while {{in several countries}} income splitting is optional (if the couple chooses it). A 2009 study of 26 European countries found that: [...] "In France, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Portugal, couples are jointly assessed. Ireland and Germany operate <b>joint</b> <b>taxation,</b> respectively, with an option for individual taxation {{and the right to}} be individually taxed when this is more advantageous; conversely individual taxation is the default option in Spain and Poland, but the option of joint assessment is offered. Elements of jointness remain in some income tax codes for which the individual is the unit of taxation - the Belgian, Estonian, Greek, Icelandic and Norwegian codes - some of which are minor while others matter. The remaining countries enforce individual income taxation without exceptions".|$|E
50|$|The Nordic {{states and}} the state of Novogorod soon began {{expanding}} northwards, dividing Sámi lands into spheres of interest. A system of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> was established for parts of the Sámi area, so that f.ex. the Sámi between the Lyngen Alps and the White Sea needed to pay taxes to both Norway/Denmark-Norway and Novgorod/Grand Duchy of Moscow/Tsardom of Russia. After the Time of Troubles and Kalmar War the borders became more concrete. In some areas, the Sámi still had to pay double taxes, though. The 18th century saw a further division of Sámi lands, between Denmark-Norway and Sweden. The final agreement {{led to the creation of}} the Lapp Codicil of 1751 which admitted some rights to the indigenous people. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was transferred from Denmark to Sweden; while Finland went from Sweden to Russia. This meant a transfer of most of the Sámi population from one sovereign to another. In 1826 the land border between Sweden-Norway and the Russian Empire in the northeast was finalized. While originally the siidas that were cut in two were to keep their rights on both sides of the border, this only lasted until Finland became sovereign and in 1920 got the Soviet Union's border regions with Norway. Norway then made an agreement with Finland, causing the split siidas to lose their now 'Norwegian' lands. Following World War II, Finland lost the territories between Norway and the Soviet Union, leaving the borders as they are presently.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{altering}} {{the current system}} of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> has been repeatedly proposed by experts to increase labor supply of women (OECD, 2011 c, 2012). Steiner and Wrohlich (2004) use a micro-simulation model to estimate potential labor supply effects of a shift from <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> to individual taxation. The authors find that the female participation rate would increase by around 4.85 percentage points and the total number of hours worked by women would rise by 11 %. However, many public finance experts maintain the contrary by considering that there is no marriage gain from <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> at all. They rather argue that <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> is a logical consequence of the progressive tax system in Germany given the normative rule that taxation should be neutral with respect to the distribution of incomes within the household (Schlick 2005). Moreover, taxing on a purely individual basis may come into conflict with the constitutional law in Germany 7.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter of this work, I study the impact of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> of married couples on married couples' labor supply. While <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> is fairly {{widespread}} across European countries, evidence of its labor supply effects is scarce {{due to a lack of}} recent policy changes in family taxation. This chapter makes use of the introduction of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> in the Czech Republic in 2005 to estimate its effect on married couples' labor supply. Results based on difference-in- differences and on triple differences with several alternative control groups suggest that the introduction of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> led to a decline of about 3 percentage points in the employment rate of married women with children. Participation declines are twice as large when the tax work disincentives are highest - among women with tertiary-educated husbands. The introduction of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> did not affect the employment probability of married men with children. The second chapter contributes to the literature on female labor supply responsiveness by measuring the effect of tax-benefit policies on female labor supply based on a broad sample of 26 European countries in 2005 - 2010. The tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD is used to calculate a measure of work incentives at the extensive margin - the participation tax rate, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|An unduly {{neglected}} {{implication of}} {{the choice of the}} tax unit is its impact on the consumption risk carried by taxpayers.

To {{answer that}} question, this paper begins by reviewing unitary and bargaining models of intrafamily allocation, and then discusses {{the determinants of}} bargaining power in a world without taxes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{discrete}} model of optimal taxation of married couples and empirically discuss the optimality of income taxation for this group. To this end, we derive the social welfare function which guarantees that <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> of married couples is optimal. We will contrast this welfare function {{with the one}} that makes a system of individual taxation optimal. For the empirical application we use a static structural labor supply model to estimate the preferences of households. We find that the system of <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> is only optimal when {{the government has a}} high taste for redistribution towards one-earner couples and a very low or even negative taste for redistribution towards couples in which both partners earn a similar amount of income. In contrast, the optimality of individual taxation is less dependent of the working composition within the household. <b>joint</b> <b>taxation,</b> optimal taxation of married couples, labor supply estimation...|$|E

40|$|By {{modifying the}} {{incentive}} structure, taxes affect human behavior. I investigate how the German income tax code influences {{the timing of}} civil marriages. The German income tax code contains provisions from which married couples stand to benefit relative to unmarried couples. If their individual incomes differ, legally married couples may benefit from filing their income taxes jointly due to a progressive income tax. The gain from <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> for married couples accrues in every year. Couples also enjoy it in {{the year in which}} they marry, independent of the month of the marriage. I use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to the hypothesis that couples with larger gains from <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> are more likely to marry late in the current year instead of early in the subsequent year. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that pecuniary gains from <b>joint</b> <b>taxation</b> incentivize couples to prepone their marriages to the current year...|$|E
