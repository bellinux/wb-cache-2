[...] "That's when I started to look around and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys.

500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... {{it dawned on me that}} the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising in the wake of the New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E
500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

I mean, we were racing and everything...I know I gave him plenty of room because I was right {{on the edge of the}} track. Because I braked so late, I nearly didn't even make the corner.

It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl.

It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. My father didn't have one, but when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the mirror just before I went on stage I saw my father's face staring straight back at me." ...|$|E
