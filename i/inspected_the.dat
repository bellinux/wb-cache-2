5|$|In {{addition}} to the survey of the orbiter's heat shield, the crew gathered and <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> EVA tools and spacesuits {{that would be used}} for the mission's spacewalks and prepared the Flight Support System (FSS) for berthing with Hubble on flight day three.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the raid, Sixth Army troops <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> camp. They {{collected}} a large number of death certificates and cemetery layouts, as well as diaries, poems, and sketchbooks. The American soldiers also paid 5pesos to each of the carabao cart drivers who had helped to evacuate the POWs.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Allingham {{was posted}} to the RNAS Air Station at Great Yarmouth {{where he worked}} in {{aircraft}} maintenance. On 13 April 1916, King George V <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> air station and its aircraft. Allingham later reported disappointment at barely missing an opportunity {{to speak with the}} king.|$|E

5|$|Commander of the {{artillery}} Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew {{the artillery}}. In early June, Knox and Greene <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> {{land at the}} north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River. The forts were hoped to discourage the British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> spacesuits {{they would}} don should a spacewalk become {{necessary}} during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the docking module over to Atlantiss docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E

The B-52 command pilot did not do a final verification check, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles to depart Minot.|$|E
5|$|She was {{refitted}} at Cromarty between February and March 1917 and King George V <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> ship on 22 June at Invergordon. Barham was refitted at Rosyth from 7–23 February 1918 and Waller {{was relieved}} by Captain Henry Buller on 18 April. The latter was succeeded by Captain Richard Horne on 1 October. She was present when the High Seas Fleet surrendered for internment on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|To fulfil their obligations, London Transport {{formally}} <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> line on 23 July 1935.

The inspection confirmed that the closure process was to proceed.|$|E

5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and <b>inspected.</b> <b>The</b> New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> hull, including the screws, bilge keels, and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Greene {{served on}} court-martial duty {{for a year}} and then {{returned}} to civil engineering in New York and Washington, D.C.

5|$|Baden was not {{originally}} intended to be surrendered {{under the terms of}} the Armistice, but was substituted for the battlecruiser Mackensen, which lay incomplete and could not put to sea. As a result, instead of joining the High Seas Fleet when it departed for Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918, Baden left Germany on 7 January 1919. The Royal Navy <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> ship on 9 January, but many of the technical instruments, including gunnery equipment, had been removed before the ship left Germany.|$|E
5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A pile of ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred. A reporter for The New York Times <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{perceived}} threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from North Vietnamese swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, Sydney was always escorted {{by at least one}} other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from Sydney and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, Sydney carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.|$|E

5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> hulk and {{determined}} that repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, as either a training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the 3rd Duke {{attempted}} {{to have the}} Wotton Tramway recognised as a railway, and William Yolland <b>inspected</b> <b>the</b> line in April 1873. The Railway Regulation Act 1844 defined minimum standards of travel, {{one of which was}} that the trains travel at an average of , which the Aveling and Porter locomotives could not manage. None of the stopping places had adequate station buildings, and the line had no signals. Yolland permitted the line to continue as a tramway, but refused to recognise it as a railway.|$|E
