5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|Interest <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> canal for its {{amenity value}} began before the canal closed, with the Inland Waterways Association {{mounting}} {{a campaign to}} retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for {{the revival of the}} Thames and Severn Canal, which depended on the Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.|$|E

5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play important roles <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> character {{and function of}} ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed dead trees to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E
5|$|By {{relying on}} the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University, asserts that the largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography. His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its Oromo population {{and the fact that the}} Cushitic-speaking Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> cultural, political, and military institutions of the Christian state.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence.

She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E

He had served in the American Field Service during World War I and when World War II broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. He died while serving in Tunisia in 1943. After his death, his widow Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not as interested <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed the ranch entirely. The buildings and grounds were left untended for years.

5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> arcs.|$|E
5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E
5|$|After the Terhunes died, Sunnybank slowly deteriorated, {{with the}} house {{and much of the}} grounds destroyed. Large chunks of the {{property}} were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune, Inc, an organization set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to provide funds for a charitable organization, the Terhune Foundation. The last ten acres of the property were eventually sold to a housing developer, which included the house, graves of the Terhune collies, and the dogs' old kennels. In 1967, this remaining chunk of Sunnybank was condemned by the Wayne Township. The next year, the township made the remaining acres a historical park, Terhune Memorial Park. The Van Riper-Hopper Historic House Museum, located several miles away, displays Terhune's writings, the awards won by the Sunnybank collies, and other memorabilia. The graves of Lad, Wolf, Lady, and the other Sunnybank dogs are preserved there and available for viewing by visitors. Clippings of Lad's coat are stored at the Library of Congress, having been donated by Anice. Annual gatherings to Sunnybank are organized by the Collie Health Foundation on the third weekend in August, during which speakers familiar with Terhune and his dogs speak, seminars and tours are conducted, and various collie-focused events and competitions are conducted. In 2005, Marilyn R. Horowitz published a Sunnybank calendar, the proceeds of which were used by the Terhune Sunnybank Memorial to restore Lad's grave, which had fallen into disrepair, and to aid <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> grounds of Sunnybank.|$|E

5|$|Although legal {{accounts}} do {{not describe}} {{the course of}} the combat, contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day's battle. According to the chronicles, the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King, Parlement and God. Before they remounted, the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris. This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> social structure of medieval France. With both men on the same social footing, there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one. Having been raised to the status of a knight, Sir Jacques regained his horse and the arena was cleared. Both knights were heavily armed and armoured, protected by a hide and wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour, riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance, longsword, heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim Pasha used {{a number}} of pretexts to delay the evacuation: {{problems}} with food supply or transport, or unforeseen difficulties in the strongholds’ handover. The French officers had difficulties <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> fighting zeal of their soldiers, who for example had become excited at the (false) news that an imminent march on Athens would take place. This impatience {{on the part of}} the French troops was perhaps decisive in convincing the Egyptian commander to respect his obligations. Moreover, French soldiers were beginning to suffer from autumn rains which drenched their tent camp, increasing the likelihood of fever and especially of dysentery. On September 24, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac wrote that thirty men of 400 in his company of military engineers were affected by fever. General Maison wished to be able to set up his men in the fortresses’ barracks. On September 7, Ibrahim Pasha accepted to evacuate his troops as of September 9. The agreement reached with General Maison provided that the Egyptians would leave with their arms, baggage and horses, but without any Greek slave or prisoner. As the Egyptian fleet could not evacuate the entire army in one go, supplies were authorised for the troops who remained on land; these men had just undergone a lengthy blockade. A first Egyptian division, 5,500 men and 27 ships, set sail on September 16, escorted by three ships from the joint fleet (two English ones and the French frigate Sirène).|$|E

5|$|The {{agreement}} drafted {{between the}} French and Malagasy governments did not clearly establish a French protectorate over the island, partly because recent French military setbacks in the Tonkin Campaign {{had begun to}} turn popular opinion against French colonial expansion. The Malagasy crown agreed to pay ten million francs to France to settle the dispute, a sum that was partly raised through the unpopular decision to increase fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of cash taxes) to mobilize the populace in panning for gold in the kingdom's rivers. This expense, coupled with Rainilaiarivony's removal of $50,000 in silver and gold coins from the tomb of Ranavalona I to offset the cost of purchasing arms {{in the run-up to}} the First Franco-Hova War, effectively emptied the royal treasury reserves. Capitalizing on Madagascar's weakened position, the French government then occupied the port town of Antsiranana and installed French Resident-General Le Myre de Vilers in Antananarivo, citing vague sections of the treaty as justification. The Resident-General was empowered by the French government to control international trade and foreign affairs on the island, although the monarchy's authority over internal administration was left unchallenged. Refusing to acknowledge the validity of the French interpretation of the treaty, Rainilaiarivony continued managing trade and international relations and unsuccessfully solicited assistance from the United States <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> island's sovereignty. In 1894, the French government pressed Rainilaiarivony to unconditionally accept the status of Madagascar as a French protectorate. In response, Rainilaiarivony broke off all diplomatic relations with France in November 1894.|$|E
5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world {{should not be}} overlooked as {{a key factor in}} its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility <b>in</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|E
