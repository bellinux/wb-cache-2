5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: neural correlate). Several groups are inspired by these advances.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{the time needed to}} evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two or three days.|$|E
5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras {{in order to}} choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E

One <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> minimize the performance loss due to jitter and control delays. Another <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> relax the nominal requirements on hard deadlines and fixed worst-case execution times. A third <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide a co-simulation environment for real-time control systems...|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for Ottawa, a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E
5|$|One of the project's <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> protect, restore {{and create}} areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely}} to benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E

In 2007 these organisations published with plans for co-operation. One of the <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the international position of culture and art in the Netherlands in the international context.|$|E

25|$|Yet another {{limitation}} is in digitizing the inputs for the VII system. VII systems will probably continue to sense existing signs and roadway markings {{but one of}} the <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eliminate such signs and markings altogether. This would require converting the locations and messages of each item into the VII system's format. Responsibility for this work would probably fall on the highway agencies which nearly all face difficulties in funding, manpower, and available time. Implementing and maintaining VII systems may therefore require support at the national level.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} the Oromo liberation movement is to exercise the Oromo peoples' right to national self-determination and end centuries of oppression and exploitation. While self-determination for the Oromo people has been the main objective of OLF, the members and leaders of the party have not formed a consensus whether the exercising of self-determination by the Oromo people {{will be in the}} form of an independent Oromia, or as part of a democratic Ethiopia. But recently, it has taken a clear stance by stating that its <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> form, if possible, a political union with other nations on the basis of equality, respect for mutual interests and the principle of voluntary associations. OLF had played a major role in the formation of the Transitional Government in 1991 following the fall of the Derg regime. However, OLF left the transitional government, alleging that its members were being intimidated, jailed, and killed in many part of Oromia. Since then OLF has been engaged in low-scale protracted armed struggle against the Ethiopian government.|$|E
25|$|Each vdev {{that the}} user defines, is {{completely}} independent from every other vdev, so {{different types of}} vdev can be mixed arbitrarily in a single ZFS system. If data redundancy is required (so that data is protected against physical device failure), then this is ensured by the user when they organize devices into vdevs, either by using a mirrored vdev or a RaidZ vdev. Data on a single device vdev may be lost if the device develops a fault. Data on a mirrored or RaidZ vdev will only be lost if enough disks fail {{at the same time}} (or before the system has resilvered any replacements due to recent disk failures). A ZFS vdev will continue to function in service if it is capable of providing at least one copy of the data stored on it, although it may become slower due to error fixing and resilvering, as part of its self-repair and data integrity processes. However ZFS is designed to not become unreasonably slow due to self-repair (unless directed to do so by an administrator) since one of its <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be capable of uninterrupted continual use even during self checking and self repair.|$|E

500|$|According to Mark Betteridge, one of Rare's main <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create games {{people will}} find enjoyable {{rather than just}} to earn profit. The Stamper {{brothers}} gave the team considerable creative freedom, although they would intervene if a product was technically flawed or under-performing. Some employees noted that working for Rare in its early days could be difficult, with staff members allowed 30 minutes for lunch and possibly working more than 60 hours a week. Nintendo worked closely with Rare, and their relationship {{was described as a}} [...] "creative partnership" [...] by Viva Piñata designer Justin Cook. According to Hansen in 2010, innovation is very important to the company, thus they focus on trying out new technology, such as Xbox 360's Kinect. According to Duncan in 2014, Rare would only develop games that had unique ideas, and will never develop a generic game with their owned intellectual properties.|$|E
500|$|Before {{starting}} his freshman season at Purdue, on June 18, 2015, Swanigan was announced {{as a member}} of the 12-man 2015 USA Basketball Men’s U19 World Championship Team for the 2015 FIBA Under-19 World Championship that won a gold medal in Haraklion, Greece. On making the team, Swanigan said, [...] "I always set goals for myself. I set goals for this spring. One of my <b>goals</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make this team to end my high school career." [...] To prepare for the games, Swanigan played in the Nike Hoop Summit, McDonald's All American Game, and the Jordan Brand Classic. Swanigan did not take part in the Indiana-Kentucky All Star Game so he could attend the U19 training camp. He was one of five player's returning from the gold medal winning U17 squad. Swanigan's teammate Vince Edwards was also in the running to make the team, but was cut at the round of 16. The team finished 7–0, and Swanigan averaged 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.|$|E

50|$|Mell then {{introduced}} to another friend from Australia, a koala named Lou who recently {{moved into the}} Hills to study. Ciel gave her the egg for him to polish on. One day, the egg that Poco entrusted to Mell started to crack and later hatched into a young dragon girl named Nina. Ciel explained that Nina is from Nordic Countries, and her egg got washed up onto the lake of Merci Hills. She has no idea who her mother was, confusing Mell and her friends about her origin but decided to find who Nina's mother was. Ciel asked Nina if she can handle the mission on {{taking care of the}} egg and she agrees. On each hardships she and her friends endure, they never forgot their mission on polishing the eggs. But each of them has their own goal: Marin's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have good food, Poco's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make everyone laugh and smile, Chico's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find the charming points to her friends, Aro's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> believe into someone, Lou's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> confront each difficulty and obstacle he face, Nina's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find her mother and Mell's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> connect everyone's hearts. In those times, each of the eggs that have been polished changed its colors. Mell then received a letter from Lutz along with a souvenir: a keychain with red Masai beads.
