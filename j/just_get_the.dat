500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original song, you <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> moment. But if you go with covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
500|$|New York writer Michael Tedder {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review for avoiding the [...] "cutesy" [...] moments that were {{featured in the}} first half of the season. He praised several of the cast members' performances in the episode, including Ellie Kemper and Mark Proksch. He also complimented the sub-plot featuring Darryl and Val, but wrote that the producers should <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> two together, because [...] "Not every ongoing plotline needs to last all season". IGN writer Cindy White wrote a positive review for the episode for allowing the [...] "less prominent characters of the ensemble" [...] to get some lines in the episode, specifically mentioning Stanley and Ryan. She also complimented the Darryl-Val subplot, writing that they're one of the few romantic pairings on the show that she's [...] "rooting" [...] for. She ultimately gave the episode an 8.0/10, calling it [...] "impressive".|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam toured relentlessly {{in support}} of Ten. Ament stated that [...] "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," [...] adding, [...] "We told the record company, 'We know we {{can be a great}} band, so let's <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} to get out and play.'" [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

[...] Pearl Jam faced a relentless touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} post was [...] "a {{fascinating}} {{look at where}} Kanye's head is at these days", and complimented West for his [...] "humility and honesty". Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, {{but in the end}} it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego. ... One day, we'll all look back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> last laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany". The next day, he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant, the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke.|$|E
2500|$|With {{writing and}} {{recording}} commencing {{almost immediately after}} finishing touring, the band were inspired to capture the energy of their live performances. Despite having previously received acclaim for redefining their sound record-to-record, the band felt little pressure to repeat this, Brian Lane simple stated that as with previous recording sessions, the band had become bored of performing their older material, and would naturally look to write and record songs that were different. Guitarist Vincent Accardi commented that [...] "after The Devil and God, the structures of songs were a bit more complex and things {{were a little bit}} delicate. I think we all just had a great urge to try to write simple, loud rock songs and <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> point across immediately".|$|E

2500|$|NME {{noted that}} the album sees Minogue [...] "dropping her {{considerable}} concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots", adding that [...] "Light Years {{is all you need}} to know about Kylie in less than an hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying." [...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative. That is her job and she does it well." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{choice to}} use a male figure to {{represent}} [...] "Virtue" [...] was unusual.

60|$|We {{were still}} so young {{as to be}} very much absorbed in the love affairs of other people; I believe women always remain young enough for that; and Mrs. March talked about the one we fancied we had {{witnessed}} the beginning of pretty much the whole evening. The next morning we got letters from Boston, telling us how the children were and all that they were doing and saying. We had stood it very well, as long as we did not hear anything about them, and we had lent ourselves in a sort of semi-forgetfulness of them to the associations of the past when they were not; but now to learn that they were hearty and happy, and that they sent love and kisses, was too much. With one mind we renounced the notion of going on to Quebec; we found that we could <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ten-o'clock train that would reach Boston by eleven that night, and we made all haste and got it. We had not been really at peace, we perceived, till that moment since we had bidden the children good-bye.|$|E
