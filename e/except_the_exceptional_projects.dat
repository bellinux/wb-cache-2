40|$|Standard {{textbooks}} {{characterize the}} evolution of an economy toward a modern market economy in the following way. Initially resources are privately owned {{but there is no}} money, so trade takes the form of unorganized barter. That is extremely costly and inefficient because it requires a double coincidence of wants. The high transactions costs that result are a barrier to any trade taking place at all. To reduce transactions costs, economic agents attempt to organize barter. Marketplaces develop, with trading grounds divided into trading posts or stalls at which specified pairs of commodities can be traded. Typically, these markets will be open for trade on specified market days. Even such organized barter is very costly, however. For example, the pairwise trading of only 10 commodities requires 45 separate trading stalls. To further reduce costs, economic agents attempt indirect pairwise trading. That can be accomplished by establishing trading posts for all commodities <b>except</b> one, <b>the</b> <b>exceptional</b> commodity being distinguished from all others {{by the fact that it}} is tradeable at all posts. <b>The</b> <b>exceptional,</b> intermediary commodity is money.

We prove the converse in all cases, <b>except</b> for <b>the</b> <b>exceptional</b> Euclidean Cartan matrices; we show even that the sequences are rational over the semiring N. We generalize these results by considering frises with variables; as a byproduct we obtain, for the cases case Am and Ãm, explicit formulas for the cluster variables, over the semiring of Laurent polynomials over N generated by the initial variables (which explains simultaneously positivity and the Laurent phenomenon).

The EU competition regulations apply solely to the anti-competitive agreements which may infringe free trade between member states, and, as such, they concern undertakings. The EU competition rules are binding in all spheres of economic activity, <b>except</b> for <b>the</b> <b>exceptional</b> cases where <b>the</b> Treaty excludes their application. Those exclusions, however, are few. One of the general exclusions is provided in the new art. 86 clause. 2 (former art. 90 clause 2) of the Treaty. It applies to those undertakings which have been given by the state the status of undertakings rendering services of general economic interest, or undertakings that constitute an element of a state monopoly, bringing a certain revenue. The notion of a state monopoly bringing revenues, or a fiscal monopoly, does not pose any major interpretation problems. However, the notion of services of general economic interest is already a specific concept that has been introduced to the community law. Moreover, it should be stressed that services of general economic interest constitute one of the prinicipal rules of the Community. Similar, or derivative, notions to those above are public utility, public services and universal services.
