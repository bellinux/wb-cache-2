5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E
5|$|Cowes Castle {{was used}} to house {{important}} visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison; {{the captain of the}} castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels. When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was initially held for the King by its captain, Humphrey Turney. On 12 August, as tensions between the rival factions on the island increased, Turney personally fired one of the castle's guns at the nearby Parliamentary naval vessel Lion. An unidentified Scottish naval captain then came ashore on 16 August and captured Turney, before landing more men and taking the castle for Parliament, who held <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the war.|$|E

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility {{means that there is}} no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{ending of}} the Vicksburg Campaign significantly degraded {{the ability of the}} Confederacy to maintain its war effort, as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article. Some historians—e.g., Ballard, p.308—suggest that the decisive battle in the campaign was actually the Battle of Champion Hill, which, once won by Grant, made victory in the subsequent siege a foregone conclusion. This action (combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9) yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, who would hold <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was chosen and he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E

5|$|Richard's grandson, Gilbert de Clare, {{the last}} male de Clare, {{died at the}} battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and the castle was given to Hugh Despenser the Younger, the {{controversial}} favourite of Edward II. Poor harvests and harsh governance by the Despenser family encouraged a Welsh rebellion under Llywelyn Bren in 1316; this was crushed and Llywelyn was hanged, drawn and quartered in Cardiff Castle in 1318 on Hugh's orders. The execution attracted much criticism from across both the English and Welsh communities, and in 1321 Hugh arrested Sir William Fleminge as a scapegoat for the incident, first detaining him in the Black Tower and then executing him in the castle grounds. Conflict between the Despensers and the other Marcher Lords broke out soon after, leading to the castle being sacked in 1321 during the Despenser War. The Despensers recovered the castle and retained <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the century, despite the execution of Hugh Despenser for treason in 1326. Under a 1340 charter granted by the Despensers, the castle's constable was made the de facto mayor of Cardiff, controlling the local courts.|$|E

In August 1944, the {{division}} was in action against the Allied Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. In late October 1944, the division was transferred to northern Italy. In December 1944, the 148th Division struck decisively against the Americans in the Apennine Mountains in Operation Wintergewitter (Winter storm), causing serious disruption despite being out-numbered and inferior in weapons to the allies.|$|E
25|$|Outlawing illegal pitches: Pitches now {{considered}} illegal, per MLB Rule 8.02(b), were outlawed. This included the shine ball, emery ball, and spitball (a very effective pitch throughout the dead-ball era). This theory states that without such effective pitches in the pitcher's arsenal, batters gained an advantage. When the spitball was outlawed in 1920, MLB recognized seventeen pitchers who had nearly built their careers {{specializing in the}} spitball.

They had three sons. David Bryant King died on May 29, 1944 in a Maryville, Missouri hospital. After the death of her husband, his widow Gladys inherited her husband's interests in the family's real estate holdings in Springfield, Ohio and brought a legal action that forced the sale of those interests.

25|$|The 16th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division RVGK {{was formed}} in November 1942 at Yefremov on the Bryansk Front with the 728th, 1283rd, 1285th, and 1286th Air Defense Regiments. Its regiments were {{previously}} independent regiments of the Bryansk Front. On 10 November, Colonel Innokenty Seredin was assigned as division commander; he commanded <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> {{of the war and}} was promoted to Major General on 7 August 1943. In mid-January it joined the 13th Army, but was transferred to the 48th Army on 31 January. The 16th fought in the Voronezh-Kastornensk operation in January and February and then the Maloarkhangelsk (Orel) Offensive in February. In April its Air Defense Regiments were redesignated as Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments.|$|E
25|$|To {{make himself}} more {{acceptable}} to the Roman hierarchy and the population of Constantinople, Tarasis adopted the Greek name of Zeno and used <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his life. In mid-late 466, Zeno married Ariadne, elder daughter of Leo I and Verina; {{as there is no}} reference to a divorce with Arcadia, she should have died in those years. The next year their son was born, and Zeno became father of the heir apparent to the throne, as the only son of Leo I's had died in his infancy; to stress his claim to the throne, the boy was called Leo. Zeno, however, was not present at the birth of his son, as in 467, he participated in a military campaign against the Goths.|$|E

While continuing weaknesses in Quebec and urban areas rightfully prompted most observers {{to consider a}} Conservative majority government to be mathematically difficult to achieve, early on, Harper's stated goal was to achieve one nonetheless. Though the Conservatives were ahead of the Liberals in Quebec, they remained far behind the Bloc Québécois, and additional gains in rural and suburban Ontario would have been necessary to meet Stephen Harper's goal.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Republic, {{religious}} and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation.
