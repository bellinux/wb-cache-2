5|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, the {{crescent}} {{was the primary}} symbol of Nanna-Sîn. The Moon goddess Selene was represented as wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement reminiscent of horns. The star and crescent arrangement also <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came {{to be used as}} a symbol of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules by}} which signs can be {{combined}} to form words and phrases are called syntax or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called semantics. The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.|$|E
5|$|The term Al Nesr Al Tair {{appeared}} in Al Achsasi al Mouakket's catalogue, which {{was translated into}} Latin as Vultur Volans. This name was applied by the Arabs to the asterism of α, β, and γ Aquilae and probably <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star. The spelling Atair has also been used. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.|$|E

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only {{at the front of}} a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees old photographs, {{including one}} {{of himself as a}} child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Madurai {{is closely}} {{associated}} with the Tamil language, and the third Tamil Sangam, a major congregation of Tamil scholars said to have been held in the city. The recorded history of the city <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century BCE, being mentioned by Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Maurya empire, and Kautilya, a minister of the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Signs of human settlements and Roman trade links dating back to 300BC are evident from excavations by Archeological Survey of India in Manalur. The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled, at different times, by the Pandyas, Cholas, Madurai Sultanate, Vijayanagar Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Carnatic kingdom, and the British.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Judaism in Turkey <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romaniote Jews of Anatolia {{who have been}} present {{since at least the}} 5th century BC. They built ancient places of worship such as the Sardis Synagogue in Lydia and the Priene Synagogue in Ionia. The Sephardi Jews who were {{expelled}} from the Iberian peninsula and southern Italy {{under the control of the}} Spanish Empire were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire between the late-15th and mid-16th centuries. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population. At present, there are around 26,000 Jews in Turkey, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.|$|E
5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside {{for the sale of}} food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a procession, when the image of the goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped into the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, the procession <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians.

He <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrecked room, {{assuming}} Selma is dead, {{but she is}} unscathed and the Simpsons are waiting for him along with the police. Bart explains how he deduced Sideshow Bob's plot: Sideshow Bob opened the gas valve in the room knowing Selma would not smell the leak, then left while she watched MacGyver, knowing that Selma would light a cigarette afterwards and cause an explosion. Sideshow Bob asks why the room still exploded if Bart foiled his plot, to which Chief Wiggum explains that he absent-mindedly threw a match into the room after smoking a celebratory cigar. Sideshow Bob is taken away by the police, vowing revenge.|$|E
