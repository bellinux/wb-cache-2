The Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC) aims to elucidate the complete genome sequence of potato, the third most important food crop in the world. The PGSC is a collaboration between 13 research groups from China, India, Poland, Russia, the Netherlands, Ireland, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, USA, New Zealand and the UK. The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes and has a (haploid) length of approximately 840 million base pairs, making it a medium-sized plant genome. The sequencing project builds on a diploid potato genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone library of 78000 clones, which has been fingerprinted and aligned into ~ 7000 physical map contigs. In addition, the BAC-ends have been sequenced and are publicly available. Approximately 30000 BACs are anchored to the Ultra High Density genetic map of potato, composed of 10000 unique AFLPTM markers. From this integrated genetic-physical map, between 50 to 150 seed BACs have currently been identified for every chromosome.

40|$|Recent {{emergence}} of next-generation DNA sequencing technology has enabled acquisition of genetic information at unprecedented scales. In {{order to determine}} the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing platforms typically employ so-called shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample the target genome with a library of relatively short overlapping reads. The order of nucleotides in the reads is determined by processing the acquired noisy signals generated by the sequencing <b>instrument.</b> <b>Assembly</b> of a genome from potentially erroneous short reads is a computationally daunting task even in the scenario where a reference genome exists. Errors and gaps in the reference, and perfect repeat regions in the target, further render the assembly challenging and cause inaccuracies. In this paper, we formulate the reference-guided sequence assembly problem as the inference of the genome sequence on a bipartite graph and solve it using a message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be interpreted as the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a certain prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm combines the information provided by the reads without needing to know reliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores). Relation of the message-passing algorithm to a provably convergent power iteration scheme is discussed. To evaluate and benchmark the performance of the proposed technique, we find an analytical expression for the probability of error of a genie-aided maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision scheme. Results on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed message-passing algorithm outperforms commonly used state-of-the-art tools, and it nearly achieves the performance of the aforementioned MAP decision scheme.

Space environment data have been gathered over several solar cycles, and though these data assist space operators in 2 Ì† 2 predicting 2 Ì† 2 hazards to space systems based upon derived climatology, no true forecasting ability yet exists. (As an analogy, consider for example the difference between tropospheric weather reports based on data-driven forecast models versus a 2 Ì† 2 prediction 2 Ì† 2 based upon the average temperature for a given city on a given date over the last hundred years.) True space weather forecasting models require assimilation of space-based in situ data into physics-based models. Data collection of fundamental characteristics, such as plasma density and temperature, neutral wind and bulk ion velocity, and electric and magnetic field strengths is required at multiple grid points, similar to tropospheric weather stations that measure temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc. Recent breakthroughs in fabrication techniques have enabled the development of a suite of instruments that is comprised of 16 individual analyzers, each of which is capable of providing a unique measurement of a partially ionized space environment. The suite is designed to measure ion spectra differential in energy and angle, bulk ion velocities, bulk neutral velocities, and ion and neutral mass spectra. Preliminary functional testing has indicated the ability to resolve He, O, O 2, and Ar; separation of O 2 and N 2 has proved elusive to date.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{electrochemiluminescence}} (ECL) involves photophysical and electrochemical aspects. Excited states are populated by an electrical stimulus. The most important applications {{are in the}} diagnostic field where {{a number of different}} biologically-relevant molecules (e. g. proteins and nucleic acids) can be recognized and quantified with a sensitivity and specificity previously not reachable. As a matter of fact the electrochemistry, differently to the classic techniques as fluorescence and chemiluminescence, allows to control the excited state generation spatially and temporally. The two research visits into A. J. Bard electrochemistry laboratories were priceless. Dr. Bard has been one of ECL pioneers, the first to introduce the technique and the one who discovered in 1972 the surprising emission of Ru(bpy) 3 2 +. I consider necessary to thank by now my supervisors Massimo and Francesco for their help and for giving me the great opportunity to know this unique science man that made me feel enthusiastic. I will never be grateful enoughâ€¦ Considering that the experimental techniques of ECL did not changed significantly in these last years the most convenient research direction has been the developing of materials with new or improved properties. In Chapter I the basics concepts and mechanisms of ECL are introduced so that the successive experiments can be easily understood. In the final paragraph the scopes of the thesis are briefly described. In Chapter II by starting from ECL experimental apparatus of Dr. Bardâ€™s laboratories the design, assembly and preliminary tests of the new Bologna instrument are carefully described. The <b>instrument</b> <b>assembly</b> required to work hard but resulted in the introduction of the new technique in our labs by allowing the continuation of the ECL studies began in Texas. In Chapter III are described the results of electrochemical and ECL studies performed on new synthesized Ru(II) complexes containing tetrazolate based ligands. ECL emission has been investigated in solution and in solid thin films. The effect of the chemical protonation of the tetrazolate ring on ECL emission has been also investigated evidencing the possibility of a catalytic effect (generation of molecular hydrogen) of one of the complexes in organic media. Finally, after a series of preliminary studies on ECL emission in acqueous buffers, the direct interaction with calf thymus DNA of some complexes has been tested by ECL and photoluminescence (PL) titration. In Chapter IV different Ir(III) complexes have been characterized electrochemically and photophysically (ECL and PL). Some complexes were already well-known in literature for their high quantum efficiency whereas the remaining were new synthesized compounds containing tetrazolate based ligands analogous to those investigated in Chapt. III. During the tests on a halogenated complex was unexpectedly evidenced the possibility to follow the kinetics of an electro-induced chemical reaction by using ECL signal. In the last chapter (V) the possibility to use mono-use silicon chips electrodes as ECL analitycal devices is under investigation. The chapter begins by describing the chip structure and materials then a signal reproducibility study and geometry optimization is carried on by using two different complexes. In the following paragraphs is reported in detail the synthesis of an ECL label based on Ru(bpy) 3 2 + and the chip functionalization by using a lipoic acid SAM and the same label.
