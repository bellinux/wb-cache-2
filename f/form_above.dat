5|$|Volcanic ash plumes can <b>form</b> <b>above</b> {{pyroclastic}} density currents, {{these are}} called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density currents travel {{away from the}} volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic density current.|$|E

25|$|Starspots are {{regions of}} intense {{magnetic}} {{activity on the}} surface of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible component of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the differential rotation of the star, the tube becomes curled up and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often <b>form</b> <b>above</b> starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that stretch out into the corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins.|$|E

25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to <b>form</b> <b>above</b> the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

500|$|Clouds which <b>form</b> <b>above</b> regions within trade wind {{regimes are}} {{typically}} composed of cumulus which extend {{no more than}} [...] in height, and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion. [...] Trade winds originate more {{from the direction of}} the poles (northeast in the Northern Hemisphere, southeast in the Southern Hemisphere) during the cold season, and are stronger in the winter than the summer. [...] As an example, the windy season in the Guianas, which lie at low latitudes in South America, occurs between January and April. [...] When the phase of the Arctic oscillation (AO) is warm, trade winds are stronger within the tropics. The cold phase of the AO leads to weaker trade winds. [...] When the trade winds are weaker, more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics, such as Central America.|$|E
