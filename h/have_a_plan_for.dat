5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

500|$|The {{addition}} of a futuristic Temporal Cold War element {{was seen as a}} [...] "nod to mystery" [...] by Rick Berman, who sought to add an element of The X-Files to the series.

Initially featured in the pilot episode, [...] "Broken Bow", it featured the Suliban being manipulated by an unknown humanoid figure from the future, nicknamed [...] "Future Guy" [...] by viewers—a moniker later adopted by the series's writers. At the start of the series, Braga said that they did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> whom the character would turn out to be. Ten years after the end of the series, Braga stated on Twitter that Future Guy was Archer manipulating his own timeline; he and Berman had previously stated, however, that the character was intended to be a Romulan.|$|E

In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: [...] "We have read that the Republicans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth."

40|$|Background: We {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which psychotherapeutic and work-oriented interventions were included in a medical treatment and rehabilitation plan and whether they predicted future employment among young adults with work disability due to a mental disorder. Methods: Data were obtained from the treatment and rehabilitation plans of 1163 young adults aged 18. 34 years, who in 2008 were granted fixed-term work disability compensation due to a mental disorder and were followed for 5 years. Results: Forty-six percent had no proposal for psychotherapy or a work-oriented intervention in their treatment and rehabilitation <b>plan,</b> 22 % <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> psychotherapeutic intervention, 23 % <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> work-oriented intervention, and 10 % had both types of interventions <b>planned.</b> <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> psychotherapeutic intervention (HR = 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 69) and of the work-oriented interventions, planned rehabilitative courses and training (HR = 1. 34, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 70) predicted quicker entry into competitive employment. <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> both <b>a</b> psychotherapeutic and work-oriented intervention was associated with being employed {{at the end of the}} follow-up (OR = 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 95).
