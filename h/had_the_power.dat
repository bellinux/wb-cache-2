5|$|Aediles were {{officers}} {{elected to}} conduct domestic affairs in Rome, and often assisted the higher magistrates. The office {{was not on}} the cursus honorum, and therefore did not mark the beginning of a political career. Every year, two curule aediles and two plebeian aediles were elected. The Tribal Assembly, while under the presidency of a higher magistrate (either a consul or praetor), elected the two curule aediles. While they had a curule chair, they did not have lictors, and thus they had no power of coercion. The Plebeian Council (principal popular assembly), under the presidency of a plebeian tribune, elected the two plebeian aediles. Aediles had wide-ranging powers over day-to-day affairs inside the city of Rome, and over the maintenance of public order. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> over public games and shows, and over the markets. They also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to repair and preserve temples, sewers and aqueducts, to maintain public records, and to issue edicts. Any expenditure of public funds, by either a curule aedile or a plebeian aedile, had to be authorized by the senate.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to tax, since it <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and was very successful and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
60|$|Cur. I'll make it out: Rebellion is an insurrection {{against the}} government; but they that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> are {{actually}} <b>the</b> government; therefore, if <b>the</b> people <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> <b>the</b> rebellion {{is in the}} king.|$|R

50|$|The 1945 Constitution: <b>The</b> {{president}} <b>has</b> {{constitutional authority}} over <b>the</b> Government and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to name and remove ministers. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to create laws with {{the agreement of}} the People's Representative Council (DPR), to make Government regulations in accordance with laws, {{and in the case}} of emergencies <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to make Government regulations in lieu of law. Militarily, the president holds supreme authority over the Army, Navy, and Air Force whilst security-wise, <b>the</b> president <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to declare a State of Emergency. Diplomatically, the president, with the agreement of <b>the</b> DPR, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to declare war, peace, and to sign treaties. In addition, he or she appoints ambassadors and consuls as well as accepting ambassadors from other countries. Finally, <b>the</b> president <b>has</b> <b>power</b> to give amnesties and pardons as well as awarding titles and honours.|$|R
5|$|Local magistrates had {{to appoint}} two {{inspectors}} known as visitors {{to ensure that}} factories and mills were complying with the Act; one {{was to be a}} clergyman and the other a Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable. Only SU-122 and the SU-152 <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to destroy the Tiger at short range, {{but they were not}} equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122 and the SU-152 at Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{respected}} the Roman emperor's privilege of appointing provincial governors, and Zenobia continued this policy during her early reign. Although the queen did not interfere in day-to-day administration, she probably <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{to command the}} governors {{in the organization of}} border security. During the rebellion, Zenobia maintained Roman forms of administration, but appointed the governors herself (most notably in Egypt, where Julius Marcellinus took office in 270 and was followed by Statilius Ammianus in 271).|$|E
50|$|The {{governor}} {{is head of}} the government of Puerto Rico. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to veto any number of projects that the Puerto Rican Legislature wishes to pass. <b>The</b> governor also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to appoint <b>the</b> members of his cabinet, who in turn must be ratified by the Legislature. <b>The</b> governor also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court and all the lower courts of the island.|$|R

5|$|On October 1, {{an apology}} letter from Blount was {{published}} in the Oregon school newspaper the Oregon Daily Emerald. Later that day, the Oregon Athletic Department released a statement indicating that a plan that could reinstate Blount to the team was under consideration. The next day, head coach Chip Kelly announced that if Blount meets certain guidelines, he could return for the November 7 game against the Stanford Cardinal. Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott responded that the conference alone <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to reinstate Blount and would take Oregon's appeal under consideration if it occurred.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} institutions of Augustus was {{the establishment of the}} Praetorian Guard in 27BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was Maxentius, as it was Constantine I who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the Castra Praetoria.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{received}} a ten-year sentence, the maximum sentence the judge <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to impose. The sentences {{received by the}} other defendants ranged from four years to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment. By {{the end of the}} trial the total cost of the Strangeways riot, including refurbishing the prison and the costs of the police inquiry and court case, had reached £112million.|$|E
50|$|The National Assembly should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{to lower}} <b>the</b> voting age to 16 for Assembly elections. <b>The</b> Assembly already <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to lower <b>the</b> voting age to 16 for a {{referendum}} on devolving income tax powers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{tribunal}} <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to hold {{public or}} private hearings. Generally, proceedings are {{to be open to}} <b>the</b> public.

5|$|Legislative: The {{bicameral}} Congress, {{made up of}} the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of <b>the</b> purse, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of impeachment, {{by which}} it can remove sitting members of the government.|$|R
5|$|The Sovereign has {{historically}} <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to choose Knights of the Order. From {{the eighteenth century}} onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon {{the advice of the}} Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|While the eze Nri lived {{relatively}} secluded {{from his}} followers, he employed {{a group of}} Jesuit-like officials called ndi Nri. These were ritual specialists, easily identifiable by facial scarifications or ichi, who traveled with ritual staffs of peace in order to purify the earth from human crimes. The ndi Nri exercised authority over wide areas of Igboland and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to install the next eze Nri.|$|E
5|$|With {{the crisis}} unresolved, Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister. Fearing that Whitlam {{would go to}} the Queen and {{potentially}} have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint. He conferred (against Whitlam's advice) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to dismiss Whitlam.|$|E
50|$|Section 177A {{creates a}} {{commission}} on judicial performance, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to recommend removal of any judge below the Supreme Court (however, only the Supreme Court can order such removal), and also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{to remove a}} Supreme Court judge upon 2/3 vote.|$|R

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon {{to meet with him}} in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E

5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, three {{important}} United States Supreme Court cases were decided which determined {{the constitutionality of}} New Deal measures, one of which originated in the Eastern District of Missouri. The case, originally filed as Norman v. B & O Railroad, reached the Supreme Court along with two cases filed in the United States Court of Claims, under the single heading of the Gold Clause Cases. The Supreme Court upheld {{the determination of the}} trial court judge, Charles Breckenridge Faris, who found that Congress <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to prohibit parties from contracting for payment in gold.|$|E
5|$|Each republican {{magistrate}} held certain constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on any individual magistrate. The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of coercion. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.|$|E
50|$|Charmed {{focuses on}} the lives of three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), as they deal with their grandmother's death and learn that they {{inherited}} a little more than the house they grew up in. All three of them have inherited magic powers; Prue <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of telekinesis, Piper <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to freeze, and Phoebe <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of premonition. Together they try to live everyday normal lives in San Francisco, while battling demons and warlocks, and keeping their supernatural identities a secret.|$|R

50|$|Most legislatures {{have their}} <b>powers</b> {{restricted}} by <b>the</b> nation's Constitution, and Montesquieu's theory of <b>the</b> separation of <b>powers</b> typically restricts a legislature's powers to legislation. Although <b>the</b> legislature <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to legislate, it is <b>the</b> courts who <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to interpret statutes, treaties and regulations. Similarly, although parliaments <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to legislate, {{it is usually}} the executive who decides on the legislative programme. The procedure is usually that a bill is introduced to Parliament, and after the required number of readings, committee stages and amendments, the bill gains approval and becomes an Act.|$|R
