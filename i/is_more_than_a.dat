5|$|In this episode, {{paranoia}} {{takes over}} {{the members of the}} office as downsizing rumors swirl. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) forms a Survivor-esque alliance with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) against the other employees—later adding Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) also. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arranges a morale-boosting birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery)—although her birthday <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke falls flat, ruining the party.|$|E
5|$|Kīlauea {{is one of}} five subaerial volcanoes {{that make}} up the island of Hawaii, created by the Hawaii hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age; Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet to breach the surface. Thus it is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E

The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age. Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet to breach the surface. At 1 million to 700,000 years of age, Mauna Loa is the second youngest of the five volcanoes on the island, making it the third youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Tytila's life or his rule, as no written records have survived from this period in East Anglian history. The mediaeval chronicler Roger of Wendover dated Tytila's reign from 578, but his source of {{information}} is unknown and the accession date {{may have been a}} guess {{on the part of the}} chronicler. Tytila's son and successor, Rædwald, the greatest of the Wuffingas monarchs, is the first East Anglian king who <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> semi-historical figure, although much information about him, including the year of his death, is conjectural. The finds from the excavations of the two separate cemeteries at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk and at other sites in East Anglia point to close connections at this time between south-eastern Britain, the Frankish Rhinelands, the Eastern Mediterranean and of growing royal prestige and authority, reflected by the magnificent grave-goods discovered in the main burial-ship at Sutton Hoo.|$|E

25|$|Dementia with Lewy bodies is {{distinguished}} from the dementia that sometimes occurs in Parkinson's disease by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to Parkinson symptoms. Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) would be the diagnosis when the onset of dementia <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year after the onset of Parkinsonian symptoms. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin {{at the same time}} or within a year of Parkinson symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Asturias {{was one of}} {{the first}} Latin American novelists to realize the {{enormous}} potential of language in literature. He had a very profound linguistic style that he employed to convey his literary vision. In his works, language <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> form of expression or a means to an end and can be quite abstract. Language does not give life to his work, rather the organic language Asturias uses has a life of its own within his work ("El lenguage tiene vida propia").|$|E
25|$|Gerbils will mate {{for several}} hours, in {{frequent}} short bursts followed by short chases, when the female allows the male to catch her. Once he catches her, the female will squeak and make flick motions {{to get the}} male off her. Males will not attack females except in rare circumstances, which may also include them having been separated from their original mates, or widowed. A female may attack a male, but usually he <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> match for her.|$|E
25|$|Wolf hunting {{has become}} a fashionable pastime for Mongolia's new {{capitalist}} rich, particularly around Ulaanbaatar. It is currently illegal to shoot animals from helicopters or jeeps, though many rich hunters do not pay attention to this, including the lawmakers. For Mongolian nomads, hunting wolves <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> rich man's hobby because of evocations to the wolf's role in their mythology. Most post-Soviet Mongols have reverted to the traditional belief that to kill a wolf in January, or even to see one, brings good fortune for the whole year.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still means something more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Loevy {{expanded}} his scope to tackle a new issue that was {{rising to the}} forefront of Israeli consciousness: environmentalism. Fourteen Footnotes to a Garbage Mountain was a documentary film about the Hiriya, once Israel's national garbage dump, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. To Israelis, however, the Hiriya <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dumpsite. It is a physical landmark—a flat-topped mountain (87 m)—towering over the heavily urbanized coastal plain and the Ayalon River. Loevy succeeded in capturing the world of the Hiriya in its final days, as it was transformed from a dump to a recycling center and national park. He documented life around the site, and the art that sprouted up from its role—once mocked—as a national compost heap.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} Torque (who never speaks) is being escorted by CO Ernesto Alvarez (voiced by Mark Dias) onto death row in Abbott State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, {{off the coast}} of Maryland, an island with a long and troubled history. Torque has been sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and their two children, {{although}} he claims to have blacked out during the incident, and can remember nothing. Shortly after entering his cell, an earthquake rocks the prison, and moments later, all of the inmates on death row except Torque are killed by strange creatures. One of the creatures opens Torque's cell, and he sets out to escape. After seeing several guards killed by the creatures, Torque uses security monitors to find the entire prison is under attack. He then gets a phone call from his dead wife, Carmen (Rafeedah Keys), telling him the island <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> prison, that it brings out evil in everyone, and advising him to escape as soon as he can.|$|E
