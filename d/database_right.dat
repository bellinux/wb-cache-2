2500|$|In the US and the UK, a Copyright grants {{protection}} {{for the expression of}} an idea and not an idea itself. [...] A <b>Database</b> <b>right</b> according to the European Union is a property right. In the EU it is defined by Directive No. 96/9/EC [...] This Directive on the legal protection of databases was passed on 11 March 1996 and affords legal protection to databases granting both specific and separate legal rights and limitations to computer records. These rights are collectively known as database rights.|$|E
50|$|For {{databases}} created after 27 March 1996, {{in addition}} to the ordinary literary copyright, a separate <b>database</b> <b>right</b> also exists. <b>Database</b> <b>right</b> exists if a substantial amount of work was required by the maker of the database to obtain the data in the database, to verify the data, or to present the database's contents. <b>Database</b> <b>right</b> is independent of any copyright in the contents of the database.|$|E
50|$|In European Union law, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> are {{specifically}} coded (i.e. sui generis) {{laws on the}} copying and dissemination of information in computer <b>databases.</b> These <b>rights</b> were first introduced in 1996. On 11 March 1996 the Council of the European Union passed Directive 96/9/EC of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, giving specific and separate legal rights (and limitations) to certain computer records. The law calls these <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b> Rights afforded to manual records under EU <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> laws are similar in format, but not identical, to those afforded artistic works.|$|R
50|$|<b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> {{last for}} fifteen years {{from the end of}} the year that the {{database}} was made available to the public, or {{from the end of the}} year of completion for private databases (Art. 10). Any substantial change which could be considered to be a substantial new investment will lead to a new term of <b>database</b> <b>rights,</b> which could, in principle, be perpetual. <b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people (especially in jurisdictions which prohibit the corporate ownership of copyright): as such, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> can be compared to the rights of phonogram and film producers.|$|R
5000|$|Copyright {{protection}} {{is not available}} for databases which aim to be [...] "complete", {{that is where the}} entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by sui generis <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b> While copyright protects the creativity of an author, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> specifically protect the [...] "qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected 7(1). <b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> are held in the first instance by the person or corporation which made the substantial investment, so long as: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{maker of}} a {{database}} {{is the person}} who compiles the database. The maker of a database is the first owner of any <b>database</b> <b>right</b> arising. As with copyright, if an employee makes a database, then the employer is the first owner of any <b>database</b> <b>right.</b> The Crown owns a <b>database</b> <b>right</b> to databases compiled by an officer of the Crown {{in the course of his}} duties, and databases made under the direction of Parliament have the right assigned to the appropriate chamber of Parliament. If two or more people make a database, then the <b>database</b> <b>right</b> is jointly owned by those people.|$|E
5000|$|Sui generis <b>database</b> <b>right</b> - {{copyright}} protection of databases ...|$|E
50|$|UK {{copyright}} law has {{a set of}} exceptions to copyright, only {{some of which are}} referred to as fair dealing. <b>Database</b> <b>right</b> has a similar set of exceptions. Fair dealing is much more restricted than the American concept of fair use. It only applies in tightly defined situations, and outside those situations it is no defence at all against a lawsuit for copyright (or <b>database</b> <b>right)</b> infringement.|$|E

5000|$|Copyright {{protection}} {{is not available}} for databases that aim to be [...] "complete"—that is, where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by sui generis <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b> While copyright protects the creativity of an author, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> specifically protect the [...] "qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents": if {{there has not been}} substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected.|$|R
50|$|<b>Database</b> <b>right</b> {{lasts for}} 15 {{years from the}} {{completion}} of the making of a database. If a database is made available to the public during that period, then the 15-year period lasts for 15 years from the time of making it available to the public. Any substantial change to a database causes the 15-year period to begin anew, as the changed database is regarded as effectively a fresh creation. Therefore, in theory, databases which regularly undergo substantial changes could enjoy (effectively) perpetual <b>database</b> <b>right</b> protection. If a database was created on or after 1 January 1983, and the database qualified for <b>database</b> <b>right</b> on 1 January 1998, that right lasts for 15 years from that date.|$|E
50|$|<b>Database</b> <b>right</b> {{is not a}} right which {{arises from}} the {{existence}} of copyright. It is entirely separate from copyright, and relates only to computer databases.|$|E
50|$|Database {{rights are}} {{independent}} of copyright: The arrangement, selection, and presentation of the data may be protected by copyright, while the database as a whole can be protected by <b>database</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although Law No. 9610/1998 confers <b>database</b> owners {{exclusive}} <b>rights</b> {{specifically for}} copying, distribution and translation of databases, it also states that this right is contingent upon the database being {{the result of}} an intellectual creation, therefore offering no sui generis <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A sui generis <b>database</b> <b>right</b> is {{considered}} to be a property right, comparable to but distinct from copyright, that exists to recognise the investment that is made in compiling a database, even when this does not involve the [...] "creative" [...] aspect that is reflected by copyright.|$|E
50|$|All data {{included}} in data.gov.uk is covered either by Crown Copyright, the Crown <b>Database</b> <b>Right</b> {{or have been}} licensed to the Crown. In turn, all data available on data.gov.uk is available under a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive license which permits use of the data under the following conditions: the copyright {{and the source of}} the data should be acknowledged by including an attribution statement specified by data.gov.uk, which is name of data provider data © Crown copyright and <b>database</b> <b>right.</b> the inclusion of the same acknowledgement is required in sub-licensing of the data, and further sub-licenses should require the same. The data should not be used in a way that suggests that the data provider endorses the use of the data. And the data or its source should not be misrepresented.|$|E
50|$|<b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> {{last for}} 15 years. Each time a {{database}} is substantially modified, however, {{a new set}} of rights are created for that database. An owner has the right to object to the copying of substantial parts of their database, even if data is extracted and reconstructed piecemeal. <b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> under the EU are created automatically, vested in the employers of creators (when the action of creation was part of employment), and {{do not have to be}} registered to have effect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{holder of}} <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> may {{prohibit}} the extraction and/or re-utilization {{of the whole}} or of {{a substantial part of}} the contents: the [...] "substantial part" [...] is evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively and reutilization is subject to the exhaustion of rights. Public lending is not an act of extraction or re-utilization. The lawful user of a database which is available to the public may freely extract and/or re-use insubstantial parts of the database (Art. 8): the holder of <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> may not place restrictions of the purpose to which the insubstantial parts are used. However, users may not [...] "perform acts which conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database", nor prejudice any copyright in the entries.

5000|$|Under {{regulations}} 13 and 14 of the regulations, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> automatically subsist {{if there}} has been a [...] "substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents" [...] of the database.|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Act also {{inserted}} various {{exceptions to}} copyright and <b>database</b> <b>right</b> into the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 {{to prevent the}} use of non-print publications by deposit libraries infringing copyright and/or database rights. However, the 2003 Act enabled regulations to be made restricting the exceptions to copyright for non-print publications so that deposited works may not be copied more freely than an equivalent work available at an ordinary library. Various exemptions from liability against breach of contract; infringement of copyright, <b>database</b> <b>right</b> or publication right; criminal liability or damages for defamation were also enacted by the 2003 Act to protect deposit libraries using works and publishers sending works to deposit libraries from actions for breach of those liabilities that could otherwise occur.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1998, the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 {{came into}} force. This act makes {{a number of}} {{amendments}} to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, extending copyright to databases (as defined by the 1997 act). In addition, contains new legislation that creates a <b>database</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} grant {{copyright}} protection to computer databases, UK copyright law recognises {{the element of}} labour and skill used in compiling them, {{even though they are}} not in truth original works (being entirely derived from existing records), applying a principle sometimes called the 'Sweat of the Brow' doctrine; they are also protected by <b>database</b> <b>right</b> (see below).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> {{last for}} fifteen years from the {{completion}} of the database or from its publication, whichever is the later, although [...] "substantial changes" [...] to the database start a new period of protection: the protection runs to 31 December of the relevant year (art. 136). <b>Database</b> <b>rights</b> are independent of any copyright which might exist in the database or its contents (art. 137); for example, a database which relied on a subjective choice of material could qualify for copyright as a compilation, and a database of copyrighted works (for example, Wikipedia) does not override the copyright existing on individual entries.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>database</b> <b>rights</b> are not waived and a {{data dump}} is not available; in fact, the FAQ even states that only limited {{downloads}} are allowed: therefore {{the right to}} fork is not guaranteed and the project can't be considered free/open.|$|R

50|$|<b>Database</b> <b>right</b> {{fair dealing}} applies {{for the use}} of {{databases}} which have been made available to the public. If a person is a lawful user of a database, fair dealing is allowed for the extraction of substantial parts of a database, if the substantial part is extracted for teaching or research, not for commercial use, and provided the source of the material is acknowledged.|$|E
50|$|HURDAT {{contains}} {{a number of}} errors which need to be corrected, such demonstrated by the outliers in the a pressure vs. wind speed graph of datapoints in the <b>database</b> (<b>right).</b> Some of these errors have existed since the database's creation during NASA's Apollo Program, where {{it was used to}} help produce probabilities of tropical cyclone-induced winds in critical areas such as Cape Kennedy (now Cape Canaveral).|$|E
50|$|Civil law jurisdictions have {{traditionally}} used the similar but not identical concept of droit d'auteur. European Union law tends to harmonize {{the protection of}} intellectual property throughout member states and the doctrine thus gains more influence. In the Databases Directive 96/9/ECthe member states of the EU are obliged to confer protection known as the <b>database</b> <b>right</b> on non-original databases, that is on those that embody no creativity, but are a consequence of substantial investment (financial, labour etc.).|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} started by people at the Free University of Berlin and Leipzig University, in {{collaboration}} with OpenLink Software, and the first publicly available dataset was published in 2007. It is made available under free licences (CC-BY-SA), allowing others to reuse the dataset; it doesn't however use an open data license to waive the sui generis <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Crown {{copyright}} licence {{does not}} affect fair dealing or fair use rights, or any other exceptions and limitations to copyright or <b>database</b> <b>rights.</b> The data are licensed [...] "as is" [...] and data.gov.uk does not accept liabilities {{in relation to the}} data or provide warranties.

40|$|The Sui Generis <b>Database</b> <b>Rights</b> (SGDR) {{protection}} grants {{an exclusive}} <b>right</b> on <b>databases</b> when a substantial investment {{is required to}} collect and arrange the database contents. Since this specific protection makes any re-use of such contents impossible without an explicit permission, therefore directly impacting on the exploitation of Open Data, managing SGDR (where exsisting) - e. g. by adopting a license - is crucial for any public body who wants to make its data available for re-use. The paper examines the new features introduced in the 4. 0 version of the Creative Commons Public Licenses, with {{particular attention to the}} treatment of SGDR to describe the suitability of the 4. 0 version in the specific field of Open Data licensing and re-use.
