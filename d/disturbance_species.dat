40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine the {{fluctuation}} characteristics of natural Populus euphratica community under surface overtopping artificial disturbance in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, China. According to the representative plot sampling method and grid sampling method, sampling sites were conducted and investigated. Selecting plant community structure, species diversity and dominant species as the characterized values of community fluctuations, the influence of surface overtopping disturbance on the P. euphratica community was studied. The main results are shown as follows. The species composition is changed a lot in P. euphratica community under surface-water overtopping <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Species</b> numbers and richness are increased in community after the influence of the disturbance. On the other hand, community structure transform simple into power to complex. And the vertical stratification tends to increase under the disturbance. After the <b>disturbance,</b> <b>species</b> diversity of P. euphratica community has great change. And both the species richness and species diversity are increased obviously while species evenness is appreciably decreased in P. euphratica community. Based on the data, the dominant species is selected from community. During the fluctuation process of community, species composition and community structure transform simple into complex significantly in P. euphratica community under disturbance. The amount of community (e. g. species richness) and species diversity are increased during the process of community change.

40|$|Lawton et al. (1998) found, in {{a highly}} cited study, that the species {{richness}} of 8 taxa each responds differently to anthropogenic disturbance in Cameroon forests. Recent developments in conservation science suggest that net number of species is an insensitive measure of change and that understanding which species are affected by disturbance is more important. It is also recognized that all disturbance types are not equal in their effect on species and that grouping species according to function rather than taxonomy is more informative of responses of biodiversity to change. In a reanalysis {{of most of the}} original Cameroon data set (canopy and ground ants, termites, canopy beetles, nematodes, and butterflies), we focused on changes in species and functional composition rather than richness and used a more inclusive measure of forest disturbance based on 4 component drivers of change: years since disturbance, tree cover, soil compaction, and degree of tree removal. Effects of disturbance on compositional change were largely concordant between taxa. Contrary to Lawton et al. ’s findings, species richness for most groups did not decline with disturbance level, providing support for the view that trends in species richness at local scales do not reflect the resilience of ecosystems to <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Disturbance</b> affected <b>species</b> composition more strongly than species richness for butterflies, canopy beetles, and litter ants. For these groups, <b>disturbance</b> caused <b>species</b> replacements rather than just species loss. Only termites showed effects of <b>disturbance</b> on <b>species</b> richness but not composition, indicating species loss without replacement. Although disturbance generally caused changes in composition, the strength of this relationship depended on the disturbance driver. Butterflies, litter ants, and nematodes were correlated with amount of tree cover, canopy beetles were most strongly correlated with time since disturbance, and termites were most strongly correlated with degree of soil disturbance. There were moderately divergent responses to disturbance between functional feeding groups. Disturbance was most strongly correlated with compositional differences of herbivores within beetles and nematodes and humus feeders within termites. Our results suggest that consideration of the impact of different forms of <b>disturbance</b> on <b>species</b> and functional composition, rather than on net numbers of species, is important when assessing the impacts of disturbance on biodiversity.

40|$|In {{order to}} control the {{dynamics}} of mixed forests in the mountainous cool-temperate region in central Kyushu, the forest structure of two stands {{at different stages of}} forest succession was investigated. From comparisons of forest structure, in dices for forest conservation were discussed with regard to extent, frequency and intensity of <b>disturbance.</b> 58 <b>species</b> were found and classified into four groups according to ranking of their relative coverage in the two stands at the each stage of succession. This ranking of species corresponded with species characteristics of appearance in the temporal series of the forest succession. This correlation was confirmed by size distribution analysis, and was thought to be a useful index for forest conservation in terms of control of the frequency of disturbance. Further, this ranking was thought to reflect the difference in the light environment of the habitats, and to be a possible control of the extent of disturbance. From the analysis of clump structure, species were classified into three types by their sprouting characteristics as follows; 1) species which can maintain their population by natural sprouting under the condition without any <b>disturbance,</b> 2) <b>species</b> which can recover their population by sprouting after <b>disturbance,</b> 3) <b>species</b> which can not sprout under any conditions and which recover only by seedlings.

We assigned C values from 0 - 10 based on their estimated degree of association with prairies of various levels of natural quality and their tolerance of disturbance.

We believe that the presence of exotic species in a native plant community lowers the conservation value of that community. Consequently, we assigned C values from - 1 to - 3 to nonnative species based on the perceived threat of their invasive potential and ability to exclude native species.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{riparian}} forests, width contributes {{most importantly}} to maximizing diversity. Therefore, corridors with different widths should differ in richness, abundance, and composition.

30|$|Disturbance is {{a factor}} {{strongly}} influencing many ecosystems, and variations in disturbance regime can affect the ecosystem and community structure and functioning (Sousa [1984]; Hobbs and Huenneke [1992]). In tropical rainforests and coral reefs, disturbance decreases the dominance of few abundant species in stable ecosystems, and it gives {{a chance for the}} coexistence of various subordinate species, resulting in the highest diversity occurring in the intermediate disturbance (Connell [1978]). Most communities exist in a state of nonequilibrium, which results in a stable level of diversity by prevention of competitive displacement (Huston [1979]). Nonequilibrium states are created by various types of disturbance (Connell [1978]; Hobbs and Huenneke [1992]). Forest gaps formed by disturbance give a chance for pioneer (<b>disturbance</b> tolerant) <b>species,</b> which might be replaced by forest-specialist (<b>disturbance</b> intolerant) <b>species</b> in climax forest (Bouget and Duelli [2004]).

Using microbial communities comprising bacterivorous ciliated protists assembled in laboratory microcosms, we experimentally investigated these questions by independently manipulating the intensity of disturbance (in the form of density-independent mortality) and community assembly history (including a control treatment with simultaneous species introduction and five sequential assembly treatments). Species diversity patterns consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis emerged in the controls, as several species showed responses indicative of a trade-off between competitive ability and ability to recover from <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Species</b> diversity in communities with sequential assembly, however, generally declined with disturbance, owing to the increased extinction risk of later colonizers at the intermediate level of disturbance. Similarities among communities subjected to different assembly histories increased with disturbance, a result due possibly to increasing disturbance reducing the importance of competition and hence priority effects. This finding is most consistent with the idea that increasing disturbance tends to reduce the likelihood of alternative stable states. Collectively, these results indicate the strong interactive effects of disturbance and assembly history on the structure of ecological communities...|$|E
