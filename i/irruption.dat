5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major <b>irruption</b> took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|The black {{honeyeaters}} {{is considered}} to be migratory rather than nomadic, with regular seasonal movements related to flowering of food plants, especially the emu bush. Some movements are southwards in the Southern Hemisphere spring and summer, moving northwards again in autumn and winter. During severe droughts it has been recorded south of Bendigo and in the Hunter Region. Irruptions (sudden population increases) can occur in some areas after rain or the movement of floodwaters. Breeding has generally been recorded in the drainage basins of Cooper Creek and the Darling River in southwestern Queensland and northwestern New South Wales, {{as well as in the}} Pilbara and Gascoyne Regions in Western Australia. However favourable conditions may result in it breeding anywhere in an <b>irruption.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having blocked Jourdan, Archduke Charles {{began moving}} troops south {{to oppose the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June. He {{received}} the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th. Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz, the archduke raced south. The last units of the Moreau's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June, though Delaborde remained guarding {{the west bank of}} the Rhine for a time. For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents. Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center. He also reorganized his army, reassigning some regiments that got lost in the confusion of the river crossing. Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle. Desaix moved downstream (north), Ferino moved upstream (south) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills, ready to support either wing. The French <b>irruption</b> caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt.|$|E

500|$|In some years, this waxwing irrupts {{south of}} its normal {{wintering}} areas, sometimes in huge numbers. The fruit {{on which the}} birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year, and in poor years, particularly those following a good crop the previous year, the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies. They will stay until the food runs out and move on again. In {{what may be the}} largest ever <b>irruption</b> in Europe, in the winter of 2004–2005, {{more than half a million}} waxwings were recorded in Germany alone. This invasion followed an unusually warm, dry breeding season. In 1908, an American flock [...] wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over.|$|E

New transformations that afflict Sandy include oozing sores (which Wright construes as an aberration of natal oil secretion) and pus emanating from the nipples (argued to mirror colostrum, or pre-milk). Sandy accepts such unnatural metamorphoses, which culminate in the onset of labour, with fascination.|$|E

500|$|Peter Bailey, in {{his study}} [...] "White Collars, Gray Lives" [...] (1999), traces the {{beginnings}} of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the [...] "disquieting <b>irruption</b> of {{a new breed of}} petty bourgeois shop and office workers" [...] that faced Victorian writers {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary [...] "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: [...] "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, [...] "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. [...] Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as [...] "Denry Machin", [...] "Mr Polly" [...] or [...] "Mr Lewisham", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. [...] In cases such as these, writes Bailey, [...] "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jung postulated, in {{addition}} to the personal unconscious (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the collective unconscious, which is the repository of human experience and which contains [...] "archetypes" [...] (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The <b>irruption</b> of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of religious experience and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal symbols, and include his work in comparative mythology.|$|E

50|$|Most, but {{not always}} all, birds leave northern, central, and inland {{southern}} California in winter. They move into the coastal lowlands and into the lower parts of the southeastern California deserts, ranging irregularly (sometimes in large numbers) southeastward to northern Sonora and northwestern Chihuahua and eastward to the southern half of Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and even the area of El Paso, Texas—roughly the Madrean Sky Islands region. In some winters mysteriously few birds are observed; possibly the birds are in Sonora and Chihuahua, which are poorly covered by naturalists. The greatest eastward <b>irruptions</b> often occur in wet periods and are synchronized with <b>irruptions</b> of other seedeating birds such as the red-breasted nuthatch, the red crossbill, and the other North American goldfinches.|$|R

2500|$|The Dutch {{now made}} a second attempt on Fontenoy, {{reinforced}} with Austrian cavalry and two battalions of British infantry, including the Highland Regiment. The Brigade of Dauphin {{were surprised by}} the <b>irruption</b> of these [...] "Highland furies, who rushed upon us with more violence than ever sea did when driven by a tempest." [...] However, concerted French fire drove the allied forces off again. This dispirited the Dutch who retired out of range and {{did not participate in}} the main attack. Along the French right flank the allies had been routed; but the battle was not yet over. On being congratulated by Monsieur de Bauffremont, Saxe simply replied, [...] "all is not said; let us go to the English, they will be harder to digest", and, at about 10:15, he abandoned his wicker carriage and mounted his famous white palfrey.|$|E
2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – {{to say nothing of the}} symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. You can be sure that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of <b>irruption</b> of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue.

2500|$|Relevant dates include 117 CE, {{when the}} Empire {{was at its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent, and the accession of Diocletian in 284. [...] Irreversible major territorial loss, however, began in 376 with a large-scale <b>irruption</b> of Goths and others. In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died, leaving a collapsing field army and the Empire, still plagued by Goths, divided between his two incapable sons. By 476 when Odoacer deposed the Emperor Romulus, the Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Invading barbarians had established their own power {{in most of the}} area of the Western Empire. While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again.|$|E

2500|$|As part of General John Burgoyne's failed 1777 {{campaign}} for the Hudson River, the British in Quebec recruited large numbers of Native Americans, some of whom participated in Burgoyne's campaign. [...] Quebec's Governor Guy Carleton had previously restricted their use in Quebec territory (which at that time encompassed the Iroquois lands now in Pennsylvania) and specifically refused to release supplies for expeditions beyond the treaty line. [...] Carleton was, however, ordered by Secretary of State George Germain to expand recruitment in May 1777. [...] This Carleton did, encouraging and funding John Butler at Fort Niagara for the purpose. [...] During the winter of 1777–78, Butler, Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and Seneca leaders Cornplanter and Sayenqueraghta planned operations for the 1778 campaign season. [...] These allies could not immediately agree on actions to take, but in a December 1777 meeting the Iroquois {{expressed a desire to}} launch [...] "a very formidable <b>irruption</b> with their whole collected force" [...] against the frontier. [...] The Seneca leaders in particular sought to target the Susquehanna's west branch, since it provided access to their lands in what is now western New York. [...] After first campaigning further south (in what is now West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania), parties of Seneca, Cayuga, and Lenape warriors began moving into the upper Susquehanna valley.|$|E
2500|$|Georges Cuvier, {{working with}} Alexandre Brongniart, {{examined}} tertiary strata {{in the region}} around Paris. Cuvier found that fossils identified rock formations as alternating between marine and [...] terrestrial deposits, indicating [...] "repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea" [...] which he identified with {{a long series of}} sudden catastrophes which had caused extinctions. In his 1812 Discours préliminaire to his Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupeds put forward a synthesis of this research into the long prehistoric period, and a historical approach to the most recent catastrophe. His historical approach tested empirical claims in the Biblical text of Genesis against other ancient writings to pick out the [...] "real facts" [...] from [...] "interested fictions". In his assessment, Moses had written the account around 3,300 years ago, long after the events described. Cuvier only discussed the Genesis Flood in general terms, as the most recent example of [...] "an event of an universal catastrophe, occasioned by an <b>irruption</b> of the waters" [...] not set [...] "much further back than five or six thousand years ago". The historical texts could be loosely related to evidence such as overturned strata and [...] "heaps of debris and rounded pebbles". An English translation was published in 1813 with a preface and notes by Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. He began the preface with a sentence which ignored Cuvier's historical approach and instead deferred to revelation: ...|$|E

40|$|Winter {{and summer}} counts of Great Spotted Woodpeckers in Karelia during 43 years (1970 – 2013) {{revealed}} significant fluctuations. Analysis of capture {{data in the}} Baltic region during 65 years (1948 – 2013) also showed large annual variation, from 0 to 1058 individuals. Winter and breeding period numbers of these birds in Karelia were positively related to summer and autumn numbers in the Baltic region. Numbers in both regions were significantly directly re-lated to spruce seed crops in the preceding year and inversely related to the crops in the cur-rent year. Of 10 years with strongest <b>irruptions</b> of Great Spotted Woodpeckers in the Baltic region, five <b>irruptions</b> occurred in years with poor spruce seed crops and five in years with good crops.
