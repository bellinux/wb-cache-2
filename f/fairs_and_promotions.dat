30|$|From this analysis, the {{identified}} differences support {{the development of}} different profiles of HE and VET students. HE students look to hospitality as a career, one that many see their families as having pride in. They were particularly interested in <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> merit-based <b>promotion</b> opportunities, <b>and</b> {{were more likely to}} be critical of current management. Many appeared to have considered their own personal fit with the hospitality industry, and where they could assess the benefits of working in the industry long-term outweighed potential disadvantages, they had a stronger long-term commitment. VET students, on the other hand, were generally contented with different aspects of the hospitality workplaces. They were not particularly concerned about but generally satisfied with promotion opportunities in the industry. They perceived themselves to be in good interactions with their co-workers. They therefore expressed a more vested interest in hospitality careers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCancer care is big {{business}} and there are significant opportunities for unethical marketing practices by various segments of the industry. Because the target population is especially vulnerable, {{it is essential that}} strict ethical guidelines are adopted and that appropriate oversight be put in place to ensure compliance. The primary stakeholders for marketing are pharmaceutical companies and large medical centers striving for increased market share. The target populations for marketing of cancer include practitioners as well as consumers. The latter group is especially vulnerable because of fears and anxiety related to their diagnosis. Recommendations for cancer marketing include: (1) ensuring <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> balanced <b>promotion</b> of cancer services, (2) avoiding exaggeration of claims in the context of reputational marketing, (3) providing data and statistics to back up direct and implied assertions whenever possible and (4) defining eligible patient groups in the context of marketing for research...|$|R

Compulsory execution of particular decisions by subordinate public bodies and civil servants. Subordinate public agencies and their civil servants are accountable for their performances. All public agencies are accountable in front of people. 4) The principle of meritocracy. It is <b>fair</b> award <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> of civil servants for their merits and achievements, for exemplary performance of official duties and unblemished public service. They have equal remuneration for the performance of equivalent work. 5) The principle of professionalism of civil servants.

Also they have to know and keep rules of ethics during their duties. 6) Training of civil servants. Civil servants have legal and social protection.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we argue that}} there is a need to reconceptualise what we mean by talent in the legal {{profession}} beyond a view that the most valuable people are those who have the highest fee-earning potential or the best CV packed with excellent grades and exceptional experiences and extra curricula achievements. And further we need a more sophisticated understanding of how organisational decision-making may be structured to provide developmental opportunities to allow talent to be nurtured and to flourish on individual and team levels. In turn, we suggest that planning, management and accountability cycles within legal entities need to be strengthened so as to ensure creativity and success in a context in which it is possible to deliver on the promise of <b>fair</b> access <b>and</b> <b>promotion.</b> Consequently, this chapter explores the diversity problem within the legal profession(s), further it interrogates what is “talent”, and how and why we should seek to manage and develop it. It then evaluates how talent diversity has been managed in the legal professional context, examined through what we have categorised as three waves of diversity strategies. We interrogate why diversity initiatives have not been more successful given the efforts placed on them by professional bodies and firms themselves. We posit that by using diversity as a case study in talent management legal entities may develop a more effective approach to talent management generally within law firms that will be of benefit to all lawyers and support professionals rather than just those who are from traditionally low participation groups...|$|R

40|$|As {{the debate}} about the need to clarify the content of the human right to science intensifies, this article assesses {{opportunities}} for opening a scholarly and policy dialogue on <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable benefit-sharing between international human rights and biodiversity lawyers. To that end, the article contrasts the emerging conceptualizations of the right to science in the context of international cultural rights <b>and</b> of <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable benefit-sharing under international biodiversity law. It then critically assesses the potential for cross-fertilization with specific regard to: the sharing of scientific information <b>and</b> <b>promotion</b> of scientific cooperation, the transfer of technology, and the protection and valorization of traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities. While acknowledging that both the right to science <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable benefit-sharing are far from being fully understood or operationalized, the article argues that developments in international biodiversity law concerning the latter may provide insights into how a vague and optimistic concept can (and when it cannot) lead to tangible outcomes, rather than remaining merely rhetorical...|$|R

40|$|Creative {{clusters}} {{are considered}} to be only viable in big cities. However, creativity can act as a driving force for the development of low density areas, combating the exodus to large metropolis. On one hand, creative people are attracted to low density environments characterized by the presence of endogenous assets, such as natural and historical-cultural amenities and by a healthy quality of life. On the other, creative businesses in the areas of design, crafts, arts, etc are the result of an active entrepreneurial spirit of these talented people who want to live, work, learn and play in these creative communities. Places with a higher concentration of creative occupations tend to have more creative activities and to develop dynamic creative clusters. Furthermore, creative industries provide innovative inputs and knowledge spillovers to traditional sectors of small economies. Thus, the creative issue could contribute to impulse a sort of leapfrog in terms of social and economic development for small and midsize towns as well as an excellent opportunity to rethink rural development. Local public policies have a role to fulfill, promoting strategies oriented to: attraction of the creative class; enhancement of creative entrepreneurship; promotion of creative industries; creation of artistic and cultural infrastructures (museums, galleries, schools, incubators); launching of events, <b>fairs</b> <b>and</b> exhibitions; <b>promotion</b> of creative urban regeneration, etc. But, the presence and role of creative clusters and talents in low density zones need to be more widely acknowledged in order to pursue innovation policies aimed at developing small economies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between low density areas and the development of creative industries and the attraction of talented people. The research approach will be based on a case study methodology centered on the analysis of three European examples of creative small urban environments (3 bidos, PT; Barnsley, UK; H 3 dmez 2 ̆ 21 a 5 v 1 s 1 rhely, HU). A conceptual model and a set of analysis dimensions will be defined as the theoretical background of this benchmarking exercise.

A lot of studies have been done on employee retention and diversity management separately but the two concepts are related therefore there is the need to look at them together.
