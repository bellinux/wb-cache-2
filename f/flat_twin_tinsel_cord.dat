25|$|In 1927 a {{new owner}} {{refitted}} {{it with a}} 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub III <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> engine, a larger rudder, and a more conventional undercarriage with larger wheels mounted on a cross axle attached to the lower fuselage {{with a pair of}} V-struts. In 1931 another new owner fitted a heavier 30hp (22kW) ABC Scorpion engine, another <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> and, to keep the weight down, reworked it as a single seater. It was in this condition when it was acquired by Richard Shuttleworth in about 1937.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, {{motorcycle}} manufacturer Douglas built generators {{powered by}} their flat-twin engines, Norman Engineering Company produced <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> generators from 1932 to 1968, and Enfield Industrial Engines (part of Enfield Cycle Company) produced 250 cc and 350 cc <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> 2-stroke petrol stationary engines {{during the war}} which were used for generators and other military uses. After the war they built flat-twin air-cooled diesel engines, with applications ranging from farm use to marine use. Coventry-Victor introduced a diesel version of their existing 688 cc petrol flat-twin in 1932, {{and went on to}} produce flat-twin diesel and petrol engines for a variety of industrial and marine uses well into the post-war period.|$|R
50|$|After World War II Douglas was in {{financial}} difficulty and reduced its output to the 350 cc flat-twin engine models. The <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> {{had been the}} Douglas trademark since 1906 and {{had a long history}} of Isle of Man TT racing successes.|$|R
5000|$|Unit {{construction}} is {{the design of}} larger motorcycles where the engine and gearbox components share a single casing.

50|$|In the mid 1950s Velocette had {{two very}} {{different}} lines of motorcycles. Alongside the larger and more conventional M and K series, they produced a series of enclosed small capacity four stroke <b>flat</b> <b>twins</b> for the commuter market, at time when most of their competitors were producing two stroke singles.|$|R

50|$|AE :A 60 cc {{four-stroke}} <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> supplied only as castings, air {{or water}} cooled.

50|$|Front-wheel drive {{continued}} with the 1948 Citroën 2CV, where the air-cooled lightweight aluminium <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> engine was mounted {{ahead of the}} front wheels, but used Hooke type universal joint driveshaft joints, and 1955 Citroën DS, featuring the mid-engine layout. Panhard of France, DKW of Germany and Saab of Sweden offered exclusively front-wheel-drive cars, starting with the 1948 Saab 92.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 Robert Opron {{began working}} on the Citroën G-mini {{prototype}} and project EN101, a replacement for the 2CV using its <b>flat</b> <b>twin</b> engine and intended to launch in 1970. The advanced space efficient designs with compact exterior dimensions and an aerodynamic drag co-efficient Cd of 0.32, were never fully developed because of negative feedback from potential clients.|$|R
