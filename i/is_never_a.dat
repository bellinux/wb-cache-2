5|$|Haunting Ground {{has been}} a subject of game studies {{regarding}} the relationship between players and their avatars.

In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E

25|$|The FID {{paradigm}} is inherently cooperative, {{with at least}} one nation helping strengthen the state. FID is a different approach than defense against external invasion or settling a major civil war. FID <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> quick process. The major power(s) uses nonmilitary and military means to increase the capability of the host nation (HN) to resist insurgency. FID includes the economic stabilization of host countries.|$|E

Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface.|$|E

Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E

Fisher House Foundation ensures that there <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> fee.

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{wrote the}} opinion, which affirmed the {{decision}} of the Illinois Appellate Court, and upheld Taylor's conviction.

The Court had held the converse view, Stevens wrote that [...] "few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense". This strong footing of Sixth Amendment values forced the Court to reject the State's absolutist argument.|$|E

500|$|Early Greek {{philosophers}} {{attempted to}} explain order in nature, anticipating modern concepts. Plato (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at {{his work on}} natural patterns — argued {{for the existence of}} universals. He considered these to consist of ideal forms ( [...] eidos: [...] "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>a</b> perfect mathematical circle. Pythagoras explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence. Empedocles to an extent anticipated Darwin's evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.|$|E
