5000|$|The {{dropping}} point test procedures {{are given in}} ASTM standards D-566 and D-2265. [...] The test apparatus consists of a <b>grease</b> <b>cup</b> with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the <b>grease</b> <b>cup</b> are coated with the grease to be tested. A thermometer is inserted into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another thermometer is inserted into the oil/block.|$|R

5000|$|The {{patent for}} the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the {{assignee}} was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation (thus the eponymous {{names for the}} fittings). Alemite was already marketing ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock <b>grease</b> <b>cups.</b> But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings.|$|R

5000|$|To {{execute a}} test, the oil/block is heated, while being stirred, {{at a rate}} of [...] to [...] per minute until the {{temperature}} is approximately [...] below the expected dropping point. The heat is reduced until the test tube temperature is at most [...] less than the oil/block temperature. Once the temperature has stabilized the sample is inserted. The dropping point is the temperature recorded on the test tube thermometer, plus a correction factor for the oil/block temperature, when a drop of grease falls {{through the hole in the}} <b>grease</b> <b>cup.</b> If the drop trails a thread, the dropping temperature is the temperature at which the thread breaks.D-2265 explains that the dropping point is useful to assist in identifying the type of grease, and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for quality control. It adds that the results are not sufficient to assess service performance because dropping point is a static test.|$|R

5000|$|Tallow or lard {{was used}} as a {{lubricant}} to ease the insertion of muzzle loaded bullets. [...] Elongated rifle bullets were designed to be cast with grooves encircling the bullet to provide a reservoir for lubricant. These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, Japan wax, bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, molybdenum disulphide, mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, <b>cup</b> <b>grease,</b> lithium soap, water pump grease, and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|R
