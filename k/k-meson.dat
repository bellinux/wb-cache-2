40|$|The {{postulated}} {{universality of}} the Weinberg's prescriptions on the diagonalization {{of the mass}} term of the Lagrangian without increasing {{the total number of}} entities leads to the following conclusions: the set of neutral <b>K-mesons</b> consists of two elements, K_S^ 0 and K_L^ 0; the states K^ 0 and K̅^ 0 do not exist as physical objects (in the form of particles or "particle mixtures"); the absence of the states K^ 0 and K̅^ 0 destroys grounds for introducing the notion of their oscillations.

Once back at TIFR, he started a new series of balloon-borne experiments for studying cosmic X-ray sources above 20 keV which helped in the future development of X-ray detectors for X-ray astronomy missions.

50|$|Some {{processes}} that involve high energy particles and {{are governed by}} the weak force (such as <b>K-meson</b> decay) defy the symmetry between time directions. However, all known physical processes do preserve a more complicated symmetry (CPT symmetry), and are therefore unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics, or to our day-to-day experience of the arrow of time. A notable exception is the wave function collapse in quantum mechanics, which is an irreversible process. It has been conjectured that {{the collapse of the}} wave function may be the reason for the Second Law of Thermodynamics. However it is more accepted today that the opposite is correct, namely that the (possibly merely apparent) wave function collapse is a consequence of quantum decoherence, a process that is ultimately an outcome of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.|$|E
