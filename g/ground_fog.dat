The new position had some severe drawbacks: the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil {{had not yet been}} constructed, so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, {{under cover}} of a heavy <b>ground</b> <b>fog,</b> the North Koreans struck Check's {{battalion}} in a counterattack. This began a heavy fight which lasted all morning. Air strikes using napalm incinerated many North Korean troops and helped the infantry to gain the ridge. At 12:00, the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, secured the former positions of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, and took over the same foxholes that unit had abandoned two nights before. During September 2, the Air Force flew 135 sorties in the 25th Infantry Division sector, reportedly destroying many North Korean units, several tanks and artillery pieces, and three villages containing ammunition dumps.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of the}} diurnal transport of water across the Martian surface is developed. The atmospheric boundary layer is modeled in terms of local radiative-convective processes, and radiative effects of ice fogs near the surface are included. Diffusion {{of water in the}} ground is treated for the cases of adsorption and condensation. The model is applied to the diurnal variation of water vapor in the atmosphere as observed by Barker (1974). The morning rise in the amount of water vapor can be explained in terms of the evaporation of <b>ground</b> <b>fogs.</b> The evening decrease is compatible with the model if adsorption dominates in the soil. The average level of vapor concentration requires that the atmosphere above the boundary layer be relatively dry. The <b>ground</b> <b>fogs</b> persist until midmorning and should be observable. Some consequences of these conclusions are discussed...|$|R

5|$|German forces {{began to}} probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences {{throughout}} the morning. Units of Kampfgruppe Von Tettau attacked the Border's positions; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and Kriegsmarine troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew. Small amounts of fighting broke out around LZ 'X' {{but not enough to}} seriously hamper the glider landing there. At DZ 'Y', the Dutch SS Wach Battalion became heavily engaged with the King's Own Scottish Borderers, threatening to hamper the arrival of the second lift. The communications breakdown meant {{that it was impossible to}} warn the aircraft. Equally, there was no way for the division to know that the 2nd lift had been delayed by <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> in England. Thus, the arrival of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue. When the parachutists did arrive after 15:00, they dropped under fire. Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath-land they were landing on caught fire. Nevertheless, the arrival of a full brigade overwhelmed the Dutch who were routed and surrendered in droves.|$|E

25|$|By 29 November, the Royalist force {{began moving}} north into the Ban Ban Valley. They moved {{tentatively}} against light resistance, worried that <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> would frustrate air support. ADC militia from Bouamlong moved south to meet them, but stopped short in the mountains. Finally, on 25 December 1970, they struck enemy supplies—100 tons of rice, munitions, and four trucks. Without any raiding any further communist caches, GM 21 and BG 224 halted in place. Counterpunch was ended on 7 January 1971.|$|E
25|$|By Autumn 1972, {{the mission}} was ready to go. However, it {{required}} certain optimal moon and weather conditions. A quartering moon was needed for the pilots' night vision goggles. A slight overcast was also desirable. When the first opportunity for the mission came on 5 October, the forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera needed for navigation failed, causing the mission to abort. The FLIR also failed on two subsequent occasions. The next attempt, {{during the last week}} of November, actually made it into North Vietnam before it was turned back by dense <b>ground</b> <b>fog.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hail fog {{sometimes}} {{occurs in}} the vicinity of significant hail accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface. It most often occurs when there is a warm, humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light. This <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt. It may form shortly after the hail falls; when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it absorbs heat when melting and evaporating.|$|E

2500|$|The {{temperature}} at the landing site was [...] and pressure of 1467.6 mbar (1.448 atm), implying a methane abundance of 5 ± 1% and methane relative humidity of 50% near the surface. Therefore, <b>ground</b> <b>fogs</b> caused by methane {{in the neighborhood}} of the landing site are unlikely. Thermometers indicated that heat was wicked away from Huygens so quickly that the ground must have been damp, and one image shows light reflected by a dewdrop as it falls across the camera's field of view. On Titan, the feeble sunlight allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain forms vs. only a few centimeters on Earth. So Titan's weather is expected to feature torrential downpours causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought.|$|R
25|$|The tanks did {{not play}} a decisive role in this action. Because of the traffic jam, many were unable to even leave their own lines; many others broke down or got stuck in a marsh before {{reaching}} the enemy. Those that managed to engage however, effectively cooperated with the infantry. A <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> largely hid the vehicles from enemy artillery and the spaced armour defeated German machine-gun Kerngeschoss-rounds. Losses were therefore low, with two tanks burnt and less than 10% personnel casualties. Six vehicles that had in May been abandoned at Moulin-de-Laffaux, could now be salvaged. Despite their modest contribution, {{the efficacy of the}} tanks seemed proven, justifying the planned expansion of the tank force. During the three 1917 battles, Schneider tanks engaged 175 enemy targets. Eighty-six vehicles were lost that year.|$|E
25|$|In early September, {{optimism}} increased among German commanders {{that the}} Flanders offensive had been defeated and several divisions and air units were transferred elsewhere. Drier weather and extensive road repairs {{made it much}} easier for the British to move vast amounts of supplies forward from the original front line. Visibility increased except for frequent <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> around dawn, which helped conceal British infantry during the attack, before clearing to expose German troop movements to British observation and attack. The British infantry succeeded in capturing most of their objectives and then holding them against German counter-attacks, inflicting many casualties on the local German defenders and Eingreifdivisionen sent to reinforce them by massed artillery and small-arms fire. German defences on the Gheluvelt Plateau, which had been retained or quickly recaptured in July and August were lost and the British began a run of success which lasted into early October.|$|E
25|$|A Santa Ana fog is a {{derivative}} phenomenon {{in which a}} <b>ground</b> <b>fog</b> settles in coastal Southern California {{at the end of}} a Santa Ana wind episode. When Santa Ana conditions prevail, with winds in the lower two to three kilometers (1.25-1.8 miles) of the atmosphere from the north through east, the air over the coastal basin is extremely dry, and this dry air extends out over offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean. When the Santa Ana winds cease, the cool and moist marine layer may re-form rapidly over the ocean if conditions are right. The air in the marine layer becomes very moist and very low clouds or fog occurs. If wind gradients turn on-shore with enough strength, this sea fog is blown onto the coastal areas. This marks a sudden and surprising transition from the hot, dry Santa Ana conditions to cool, moist, and gray marine weather, as the Santa Ana fog can blow onshore and envelope cities in as quickly as fifteen minutes. However, a true Santa Ana fog is rare, because it requires conditions conducive to rapid re-forming of the marine layer, plus a rapid and strong reversal in wind gradients from off-shore to on-shore winds. More often, the high pressure system over the Great Basin, which caused the Santa Ana conditions in the first place, is slow to weaken or move east across the United States. In this more usual case, the Santa Ana winds cease, but warm, dry conditions under a stationary air mass continue for days or even weeks after the Santa Ana wind event ends.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} feature of cloud forests is the tree crowns can intercept the wind-driven cloud moisture, part of which drips to the <b>ground.</b> This <b>fog</b> drip occurs when water droplets from the fog adhere to the needles or leaves of trees or other objects, coalesce into larger drops and then drop to the ground.

2500|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>fog</b> is fog that obscures {{less than}} 60% {{of the sky}} and does not extend to the base of any {{overhead}} clouds.

25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog.

Barlow and drove them off. Hancock's other advanced division, under Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, became disordered in swampy ground and could not advance through the heavy Confederate fire.

30|$|The {{relative}} I/F {{of each of}} the brightened {{areas within}} the spectral windows is also inconsistent with clouds. Figure 21 shows the integrated I/F for the Yalaing Terra brightened pixels from T 76 compared against Equatorial Bright terrain, dark brown terrain (dunes), and clouds, all with the same viewing geometry. The T 76 brightenings plot outside the bounds of normal Equatorial Bright terrain, but also fall well outside the region associated with clouds. Because this in-window test depends more highly on the target’s spectrum and less on its altitude, it allows us to rule out near-surface <b>ground</b> <b>fogs</b> as well as high clouds. The longevity and temporal consistency of the changed features is likewise inconsistent with fog. Viewing geometry significantly affects Titan spectra. To maximize the interpretability of intercomparison we therefore use observations with as nearly identical observing geometry as possible. In particular, we elect to use the cloud on T 33 as a comparison, based on the incidence and emission angles from the T 76 Hetpet Regio geometry (i= 31 °, e= 47 °), having searched the entire VIMS dataset for points on each flyby that had identical geometry. In general, {{there is at least one}} such point for each flyby (though their phase angles will differ depending on the illumination geometry of the flyby). We then correlated that ‘best match’ pixel on each flyby with its corresponding cylindrical map to find the best geometric matches to any given category of spectral unit (in this case, cloud). The T 33 cloud at 40.1 °S 142.9 °E compares most favorably and is shown in Figure 20.|$|R
