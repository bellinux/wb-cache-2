50|$|<b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> {{have been}} used as model organisms for the study of soaring and thermoregulation. The energy costs of level flight tend to be high, {{prompting}} alternatives to flapping in larger birds. Vultures in particular utilize more efficient flying methods such as soaring. Compared to other birds, which elevate their metabolic rate to upwards of 16 times their basal metabolic rate in flight, soaring <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> expend about 1.43 times their basal metabolic rate in flight. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> are also efficient flyers in their ability to return to a resting heart rate after flight within ten minutes.|$|R

25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, wallcreeper and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture,</b> Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and common kestrel, that search for food in a wider zone.|$|E

This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's fish eagle, grey-headed fish eagle and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses [...] the <b>griffon</b> <b>vulture</b> and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers ecological niche in Kaziranga.|$|E

40|$|Curs 2014 - 2015 <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> (Gyps fulvus) moult {{is poorly}} known due to {{hardness}} to trap them; however, {{this process is}} very important for long-term soaring species. From 2013 to 2015, we studied the moult patterns of 1077 wild <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> in Catalonia, examining the age of their feathers and testing if they moulted on demand. The moulting period lasted from April to December, ending in winter for adults and it was continuous for immatures, although it was less active in winter. Griffons needed five calendar years to become adults, but once adults; they could replace all their flight feathers in 2 years. First calendar year <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> did not moult any feather until April of their following year. Second calendar year vultures demonstrated a stepwise moult (with several moult waves) on primary feathers. Adults showed higher intensity and higher randomness, despite they also showed a stepwise moult on primaries. On secondaries, subadults showed different moult focus. They did not show a clear moult on demand despite few of them shown alterated moults with feathers moulted around a cut feather, not following the moult wave. Adults did not show a consistent moult pattern but we think they may follow a moulting cycle alternating 5 th calendar years and 6 th calendar years patterns but possibly with some delays due to nutrition problems on their lives and some other alterations like loss of feathers on the battles they have when they are eating on carcasses; this could explain the asymmetry that Zuberogoitia (2013) has found on <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures</b> moults, and why some feathers have more probability to be moulted despite we found that moult on demand does not seem to occur in wild <b>Griffon</b> <b>Vultures...</b>|$|R
50|$|Social {{facilitation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used to develop}} successful social scavenging strategies. <b>Griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> are highly specialized scavengers that rely on finding carcasses. When foraging, <b>griffon</b> <b>vultures</b> soar at up to 800 m above the ground.
