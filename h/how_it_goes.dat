People tuned into the show by accessing iTunes on their PCs or Macintosh computers. The live performance was later released, as Paul McCartney's Live Kisses, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, airing on PBS' Great Performances in September 2012. The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it yet. People have plenty of ideas and suggestions. I'd like to see <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> live, just how much we enjoy it. If we all enjoy it, then we've got to think about taking it out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{has been}} {{embroiled in a}} feud with veteran rapper Lil' Kim since her success with Pink Friday. Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E

500|$|Basu {{wanted to}} cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani {{suggested}} Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see [...] "the Priyanka Chopra" [...] and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained [...] "I had the fear that I would see Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn’t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character." [...] Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first and see <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was glad that he chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed {{that he did not}} approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached {{to play the role of}} the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, [...] "It’s true we’ve been unable to cast the other part." [...] After facing several casting problems, Basu chose {{to cast a}} completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
