He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E

Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E

5|$|In 1920 and 1921, local {{opposition}} to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed. Among {{the most significant}} was the Tambov Rebellion, which was put down by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law {{in the city and}} sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the Kronstadt rebellion began when sailors in Kronstadt revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> and not be subject to requisitioning. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army put down the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> {{and believed that}} they could be detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E

5|$|Castro {{believed}} in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was {{to survive in a}} world now dominated by capitalist <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> In October 1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} technological innovation can soften pressure and enlarge opportunity to gain the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The <b>free</b> <b>market</b> operation becomes uncertain {{in relation to the}} domestic affairs and global circumstances. The accelerated process of moving toward <b>free</b> <b>market</b> under a domestically worsening economic situation may backfire, while slowing it down becomes backward under the globally progressing <b>free</b> <b>market</b> circumstances. In dealing with the complexity of building up competitiveness under the pressure of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition, we propose a model; the so-called ‘adaptive innovation policy’. The model is drawn from the metaphor of living system and its environment. The adaptive innovation is continuous enrichment of technology as the nutrition of living economic system to evolve in gaining the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The simulation results from the model imply that: i) dealing with the complexity of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition requires understanding the behavior of multiple feedback inside the complex economic system; ii) spurring the economic growth by capital investment beyond the carrying capacity of market could bring about economic instability; iii...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{and other}} intellectuals have debated for centuries for {{the merits of}} free trade and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as an {{economic}} policy. Irwin (1996) wrote, " [...] . that the proposition that freedom of trade is on the whole economically more beneficial than protection, {{is one of the}} most fundamental propositions economic theory has to offer for the guidance of economic policy". However, there are questions fairness and validity in the distribution of resources and that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. Adams smith theory of morality and justice is presented and analyzed in relation to his argument that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. This paper will then provide critique on the morality argument for <b>free</b> <b>market.</b> John Rawls theory ofjustice will be used as a basis for criticizing the argument that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} long-term {{developments in}} the quality and efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional systems across thirteen emerging economies from South, South-east, and East Asia over the 1995 – 2014 period.

We find that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional framework in most economies is still relatively inefficient, restrictive, and underdeveloped but has, nevertheless, substantially improved during the last twenty-year period. Our empirical results also indicate that a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional system in a host-country is a factor that attracts inward FDI to emerging Asian economies by multinational companies. Consequently, policy makers should focus on further {{improving the quality of}} <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutions...|$|R

Under the responsibility system for agriculture instituted in 1981, the household replaced the production team as the basic production unit.

40|$|Unconventional {{oil and gas}} extraction(UOGE) {{has spurred}} an {{unprecedented}} boom in on-shore production in the U. S. Despite a surge in related research, a void exists regarding policy-related inquiries. To address this gap, we examine support of federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE using survey data collected in 2015 from two northern Colorado communities {{as part of a}} National Institutes of Health study. We assert that current regulatory exemptions for UOGE can be understood as components of broader societal processes of neoliberalization. We test whether <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideologies relate to people’s regulatory views and find that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology increases public support for federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE. We find that perceived negative impacts do not necessarily drive people to support increased federal regulation. Utilizing neo-Polanyian theory, we tested for an interaction between <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology and perceived negative impacts(Block and Somers 2014; Author 2015). Interestingly, <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology appears to moderate people’s views of regulation. <b>Free</b> <b>market</b> ideology seems to increase the effect of perceived negative impacts while simultaneously increasing support for deregulation. We conclude with a nuanced theoretical discussion to analyze how <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology might normalize the impacts of UOGE activity...|$|R
