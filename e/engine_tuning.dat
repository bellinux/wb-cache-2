[...] Nonetheless, its low powered engine did not provide high enough performance for a fighter and no more powerful engines were immediately available in the Netherlands. [...] No more V.1s were built; the prototype was bought by the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service in 1917 and retired in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|The Maserati MC12 has {{the same}} engine, chassis and gearbox as the Enzo but the only {{externally}} visible component from the Enzo is the windshield.

The MC12 is slower accelerating (0–100km/h or 0–62mph in 3.8 s), has a lower top speed of 330km/h (205mph) and less drag coefficient (due to sharper nose and smoother curves) than the Enzo due to <b>engine</b> <b>tuning.</b> [...] However, the MC12 has lapped race tracks faster than the Enzo before, specifically on the UK motoring show Top Gear, and the Nurburgring Nordschleife (at colder outside temperature). [...] However this {{could be attributed to}} the MC12's Pirelli PZero Corsa tires which have more grip than the Enzo's Bridgestone Scuderias.|$|E
