40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} spirometric obstructive pulmonary function impairment among {{workers who}} were occupationally exposed to organic solvents, <b>iron</b> oxide <b>dust,</b> or welding fumes. Data were collected from records of periodic health examinations of workers. In total, 448 Korean male work-ers were enrolled and classified into three exposure groups: exposure to organic solvents, <b>iron</b> oxide <b>dust,</b> or welding fumes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association be-tween occupational exposure and pulmonary function. Compared to exposure to organic solvents, exposure to <b>iron</b> oxide <b>dust</b> {{was significantly associated with}} obstructive pulmonary function im-pairment (odds ratio [OR], 9. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 20 – 41. 97). The group exposed to welding fumes did not show a significantly higher OR compare to those exposed to organic solvents (OR, 2. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 74 – 10. 8). These results suggest that exposure to <b>iron</b> oxide <b>dust</b> has a greater association with obstructive pulmonary function impairment than exposure to organic solvents or welding fumes...|$|R

40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and growth}} of <b>iron</b> metal <b>dusting</b> in CO-H 2 -H 2 O gas mixtures at 700 °C were investigated by surface observations of very {{early stages of the}} reaction. At first, iron was supersaturated with dissolved carbon and its surface became facetted. The nucleation of graphite and cementite depended on the surface crystallographic orientation. A fine grain structure at ground surfaces and a high carbon activity accelerated cementite nucleation. Further carburisation resulted in the formation of particulate areas mixed with deposited graphite, which accelerated the spallation of cementite and the protrusion of round particles. In some areas, large graphite mounds and bulk graphite were formed on the surface. Filamentous carbon was found in particulate areas and surrounding the graphite mounds. Based on these observations, a possible process of <b>iron</b> metal <b>dusting</b> was discussed...|$|R

50|$|Three asteroids are discovered, one {{of which}} is on a {{collision}} course with Earth. The UN launches a series of nuclear missiles at the asteroid in order to deflect or destroy the asteroid. The other two asteroids shift trajectories to a collision course with Earth. The first asteroid passes through Earth's atmosphere almost parallel to the ground, but close enough to cause incredible amounts of damage due to the force of the shock wave it makes, creating damage from Northern Alaska, in a southeastern curve through Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central America, Columbia and Brazil. Its entrance and exit to and from the atmosphere siphons off a huge amount of ozone, which allows the ultraviolet rays from the sun to destroy crops and causes worldwide famine. The second asteroid directly collides with Earth, striking in the Philippine Basin of the Pacific Ocean and causing seismic upheaval. The asteroid's explosion on the sea floor sent <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> throughout the Pacific Ocean, which quickly turned red with rust.|$|E
50|$|The second {{treatise}} {{starts with}} a classical experiment showing the proper alignment of the loadstone to the poles, followed {{by a lot of}} experiences about the interaction between two loadstones, between the loadstone and iron, and about the transmission of the magnetic virtue. Garzoni then considers the diffusion of the magnetic virtue inside the stone, outside it, and inside iron. These results are obtained by magnetizing bodies of different shapes and sizes. In particular, Garzoni considers the behaviour of magnetized <b>iron</b> <b>dust.</b> The behaviour of iron placed in the sphere of action of more loadstones is salso investigated. In the subsequent experiments, Garzoni studies the external diffusion of magnetic virtue by displacing a magnetic needle within the sphere of action. At every point, the direction of the needle gives the direction of the magnetic virtue. The configuration Garzoni obtains coincides with the one theorized in the first treatise (look at the accompanying diagrams displaying the lines of propagation of verticity). Garzoni then studies the behaviour of two magnetized needles, and he investigates the action of non-magnetized iron, the properties of the quality of one face and the alteration of the quality of one and two faces. Finally, he quickly mentions spontaneous magnetization and the loss of verticity.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fuel {{properties}} on ash deposition behaviour in a coal fired Rotary kiln, used for preparing iron rich pellets from virgin iron ore, was examined using simulated combustion conditions {{combined with a}} range of analytical techniques. A new index based on ash melting during thermo-mechanical analysis of coal ash is developed to predict ash deposition potential in a Rotary kiln, and related to ash deposition trend near the kiln entrance. <b>Iron</b> <b>dust</b> was found to consist of mainly hematite. <b>Iron</b> <b>dust</b> presence in coal increases ash agglomeration tendency such that agglomeration intensity increases with increasing concentration of <b>iron</b> <b>dust.</b> The study also established that intensity of <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> impact is influenced by parent coal chemistry such that iron and calcium rich coals displayed greater intensity of <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> impact. It seems external iron presence has a stronger effect on ash agglomeration compared to inherent coal iron minerals as confirmed by TMA index and ash agglomerate plot. The interfacial examination of <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> and ash particles did not show any apparent evidence of chemical interactions which implies that <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> mainly participated physically for the evolution of agglomerate at least under tested conditions. This suggests that in Rotary kiln, inertial impaction of <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> may be determining intensity of deposit formation. Increasing kaolinite concentration in coal did not show any apparent change on the agglomeration tendency for low to medium slagging coals. It is possible that due to smaller particle size and lower density, their contribution to possible inertial impaction may be not significant. The study further highlighted that increase in mullite presence in high slagging coals mainly seems to be attributed to addition of external kaolinite in specimens. Like <b>iron</b> <b>dust,</b> kaolinite particles did not appear to show any chemical interaction with coal ash particles, even though occurs as mullite in the agglomerate. The interfacial studies supported the ash deposition prediction based on TMA index such that coals with high TMA index displayed high agglomeration index with exception of kaolinite rich coals. The study suggests that physical properties of coal minerals particularly iron bearing phases in coals may have strong effect on the growth of agglomeration. Therefore, future studies may focus on establishing the effect of physical properties of additive as well as variation of coal mineral chemistry with coal grain size...|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that <b>iron</b> ore <b>dust</b> derived from industrial shiploading activities in north-western Australia may be more injurious to mangroves than is naturally-derived dust, because of its more angular structure and presumed ability to damage stomatal cells. Abaxial hairs on the most common mangrove, Avicennia marina (Forfk). Vierh., have been thought to exacerbate this effect through trapping and retaining dust. This study examined this hypothesis. Leaves were collected from dusty industrial areas and natural environments. Leaves in dusty environments were chosen {{on the basis of}} their thick coating of <b>iron</b> ore <b>dust</b> on both leaf surfaces. Approximately 3, 000 stomata were examined in detail using light microscopy. Hair density, stomatal aperture, cell condition and presence of dust were also noted. Despite there often being a visible layer of dust on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of the leaf, evidence for dust of any kind within stomatal spaces was noted, in total, only three times. The lack of visible dust in stomata was attributed to three factors; the density and morphology of the abaxial hairs, which prevent dust from entering the space between the hairs, and the improbability of dust circulating in the stagnant air within that space and moving against gravity past the guard cells. It was concluded that if <b>iron</b> ore <b>dust</b> affects mangroves, it must do so by some other mechanism, such as either increased temperature, shading or a restriction of transpiration by the thickness of the dust on the abaxial surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of the peripheral plasma in the Large Helical Device (LHD) on transport of dusts is investigated using a dust transport simulation code (DUSTT) in a non-axisymmetric geometry.

The trajectories of dusts are investigated in two probable situations: release of spherical <b>iron</b> <b>dusts</b> from the inboard side of the torus, and drop of spherical carbon dusts from a divertor plate installed near an edge of an upper port. The trajectories in these two situations are calculated in various sized dust cases. From a viewpoint of protection of the main plasma from dust penetration, it proves that there are two functions in the LHD peripheral plasma. One is sweeping of dusts by the effect of the plasma flow in the divertor legs, and another one is evaporation/sublimation of dusts by heat load onto the dusts in the ergodic layer...|$|R

The experiments were performed with a 2 MV Van de Graaff, where <b>iron</b> <b>dust</b> particles (0. 14 - 0. 63 mu m in diameter) impacted soda-lime glass at a velocity range of 5 - 20 kill s(- 1).

Although theoretical calculations are limited by the use of the Mie-Gruneisen EoS up to the point of incipient vaporisation of the target material, relatively good agreement with experiments is observed.

The model has two external sources of iron: <b>dust</b> <b>iron</b> at the sea surface and sedimentary iron at the seabed shallower than 300 m.

Sensitivity experiments for the solubility of <b>dust</b> <b>iron</b> in seawater suggest that a solubility of 1 % is appropriate in our simulation.
