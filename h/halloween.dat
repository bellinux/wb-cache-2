5|$|Following {{the success}} of <b>Halloween,</b> Yablans and Akkad began working on <b>Halloween</b> II. There was initial {{discussion}} about filming <b>Halloween</b> II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After <b>Halloween</b> II was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third <b>Halloween</b> film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair {{agreed to participate in}} the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to <b>Halloween</b> II, which meant no Michael Myers. Most of the filming for <b>Halloween</b> III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.|$|E
5|$|When the {{original}} <b>Halloween</b> {{was released in}} 1978, a novelization of the movie followed just a year later. Written by Curtis Richards, the book follows {{the events of the}} film, but expands on the festival of Samhain and Michael's time at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. <b>Halloween</b> II, <b>Halloween</b> III: Season of the Witch, and <b>Halloween</b> 4 each received novelizations as well. Jack Martin would write <b>Halloween</b> II, which was released alongside its film counterpart. Martin included an additional victim of Michael's in this novel. <b>Halloween</b> IV, released in October 1988 and written by Nicholas Grabowsky, also followed the events of the film in which it was adapted from. As of 2017, no further films have been novelized.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, it was {{announced}} that Dimension Films no longer had the rights to the <b>Halloween</b> franchise. The cancellation of the planned film <b>Halloween</b> Returns was confirmed at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, it was {{reported}} that Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan would be writing a new <b>Halloween</b> film, along with Malek Akkad and Matt Stein producing. On June 15, 2015, it was further reported that The Weinstein Company was moving ahead with another <b>Halloween</b> sequel, tentatively titled <b>Halloween</b> Returns with Dunstan directing. The film would've been a standalone film set to reintroduce audiences to Michael Myers years after his initial rampage. It would pit a new group of Haddonfield youngsters against Myers.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter {{wrote the}} film in the mid-1970s as a {{reaction}} to the Watergate scandal. After the success of <b>Halloween,</b> he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in <b>Halloween.</b>|$|E
5|$|Designed by Steve Brown and Richard Leinfellner, Cauldron {{originated}} as {{a licensed}} video {{game of the}} horror film <b>Halloween.</b> Brown eventually altered the game to use a theme based on the <b>Halloween</b> holiday. The mix of two genres resulted from Brown and Leinfellner wanting to make a shoot 'em up and platform game, respectively. The developers realized {{that there were no}} technical limitations preventing the genres from being combined.|$|E

5|$|For <b>Halloween</b> II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of <b>Halloween</b> II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original <b>Halloween</b> theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Halloween</b> II {{was officially}} {{released}} on August 28, 2009 in North America, and {{was met with}} a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America {{to coincide with the}} <b>Halloween</b> holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33.4 million in North America, and $5.9 million in foreign countries giving the film a worldwide total of $39.3 million.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in <b>Halloween</b> Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain <b>Halloween</b> costumes in <b>Halloween</b> Town {{to blend in with}} the locals.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>Halloween</b> comic was {{published}} by Brian Pulido's Chaos! Comics. Simply titled <b>Halloween,</b> {{it was intended to}} be a one-issue special, but eventually two sequels spawned: <b>Halloween</b> II: The Blackest Eyes and <b>Halloween</b> III: The Devil's Eyes. All of the stories were written by Phil Nutman, with Daniel Farrands—writer for Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers—assisting on the first issue; David Brewer and Justiniano worked on the illustrations. Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues, focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers. The first issue includes back story on Michael's childhood, while the third picks up after the events of the film <b>Halloween</b> H20. These comics were based on Daniel Farrand's concept for Halloween: Resurrection; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow-up to <b>Halloween</b> H20. His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith's Grove for Michael Myers' crimes, only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace. Together, they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael's childhood. The movie would have explored Michael's time at Smith's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis, before returning to Tommy and Lindsay, who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers. Upon defeating him and removing his mask, they discover Laurie Strode, who has taken over her brother's mantle. Farrand's logic was that, since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween: Resurrection, they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible. Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch, Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>Halloween</b> (1978), co-written {{and directed}} by John Carpenter, {{tells the story of}} Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on <b>Halloween</b> night. The film begins with six-year-old Michael (Will Sandin) killing his teenage sister Judith (Sandy Johnson) on <b>Halloween</b> 1963 in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is subsequently hospitalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael (Nick Castle and Tony Moran) escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends as they babysit. The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). <b>Halloween</b> II (1981) picks up where the events of <b>Halloween</b> left off. Michael's body is missing from the front lawn, where he fell when Loomis shot him. Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital, killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie. The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael's sister: she was given up for adoption as an infant. Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an operating room, where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes. Michael, engulfed in flames, stumbles out of the room toward Laurie before finally falling dead.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{four days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of the film, a workprint version of <b>Halloween</b> appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, , to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. <b>Halloween</b> was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous <b>Halloween</b> films.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Jesse and Festus {{defeated}} Deuce 'n Domino {{in a dark}} match. Throughout the event, the WWE Divas were shown in <b>Halloween</b> costumes in a contest where the winner would {{be determined by the}} fans.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was no longer able financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual <b>Halloween</b> party. After a final defiant <b>Halloween</b> celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, Michael (Tyler Mane) {{continues}} making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts {{to move on}} with his life and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael kills the sanitarium employees and escapes from Smith's Grove. He kills a truck driver for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On <b>Halloween,</b> Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and <b>Halloween</b> mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for <b>Halloween</b> II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for <b>Halloween</b> II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Halloween</b> is an American horror {{franchise}} {{that consists of}} ten films, novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game.

Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of Haddonfield, Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of <b>Halloween,</b> on which all of the films primarily take place.|$|E
