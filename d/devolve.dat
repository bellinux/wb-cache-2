By mid-September, they accepted the deal to produce the series alongside Casanova.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the {{new state}} had a semi-presidential constitution, known as the Loi Fondamentale, in which {{executive}} power was shared between President and Prime Minister in a system known as bicephalisme. Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite the objections of CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not <b>devolve</b> significant powers to provincial level.|$|E

As a compromise the Bandaranaike government proposed the District Councils Bill to <b>devolve</b> powers to districts but following protests from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists dropped the bill in June 1964. In 1964, as ITAK started preparing for a second civil disobedience campaign, the government started collapsing. As several SLFP MPs defected to the opposition, the government sough ITAK's support but ITAK chose instead to support the opposition and on 3 December 1964 the government was unable to prove its majority in parliament, precipitating an election.|$|E
5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or <b>devolve</b> into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start by {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually <b>devolve</b> into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{as a result of}} devolution, funding for <b>devolved</b> issues to the Scottish Parliament as well as the Welsh & Northern Irish {{assemblies}} has been determined through the Barnett Formula. This formula determines the overall budget of the <b>devolved</b> parliaments for <b>devolved</b> issues proportionally relative to spending on those issues in England. As a result, while responsibility for funding of <b>devolved</b> matters rests with the <b>devolved</b> bodies themselves, they in effect must enact policies of a broadly similar cost to those decided by the UK parliament for England and maintain that broad proportionality in order to ensure the long term financial viability of such policies.|$|R

5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to <b>devolve</b> power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to <b>devolve</b> the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E

The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E

5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan that is named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares <b>devolve</b> to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to <b>devolve</b> to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E

5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics.

As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh words from the Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E
