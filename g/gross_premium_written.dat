40|$|AbstractThe {{correlation}} between insurance {{and economic growth}} has been analyzed by many authors at the international level, thus {{there are a lot}} of studies seeking to assess the causal relation between macroeconomic performance and the size of the insurance sector. The insurance becomes a major component in certain economies, consequently the weight of insurance to the GDP of every country being over 10 % in some European countries (such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Finland), and it is even higher as the economic development is higher. We can say that the percentage in GDP of a country is the measure of the development of that respective state. The purpose of this paper is to establish the {{correlation between}} insurance and economic growth in Romania, by taking into consideration the share of <b>gross</b> <b>premium</b> <b>written</b> to GDP (insurance penetration), and the average value of the insurance premium paid by an inhabitant across one year (insurance density), as insurance indicators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{contribute}} to the corporate governance literature by establishing the relationship between board characteristics and corporate performance within the nonlife insurance firms in Zimbabwe. The study sought to provide some insights on corporate governance since the phenomenon is relatively an emerging discipline in Zimbabwe. The paper sought to complement other corporate governance studies that were conducted in other environments by producing evidence on the phenomenon from a developing country context. A quantitative research approach was adopted and respondents were selected through a stratified random sampling. The results of the study confirm that board characteristics (board composition, diversity, and size) exhibit a statistically significant positive predictive relationship with the performance of non-life insurance firms measured by <b>gross</b> <b>premium</b> <b>written</b> and customer retention. However, CEO/Chairman duality showed a negative relationship with business performance. Non-life insurance companies need to be cognizant of board characteristics in order to improve their performance. Moreover, the findings in this research has practical relevance for the selection process of directors as it highlights the importance of having a sizeable number of board members as well as an appropriate mix of competences and qualifications on the board. Although corporate governance is has been extensively researched, there is limited study in this area from a developing country like Zimbabwe with relatively less developed capital markets. It would be wrong to assume that the findings found in other countries can apply here because the conditions are different...|$|E
