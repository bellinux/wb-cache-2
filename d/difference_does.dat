25|$|Training in {{internal}} medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on medical education and physician for more details. In North America, it requires {{at least three}} years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.|$|E

25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E
500|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] was {{released}} as the Smiths' debut recording in May 1983. The single sold consistently {{for the next}} 18 months. Although the single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, it reached number three on the UK Indie Chart. Its relative success earned the group a listing in the Guinness Book of Records in January 1984 when it and the group's next two singles' [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> It Make?"' held the top three position on the UK Indie Chart. [...] "It {{should have been a}} massive hit", Morrissey later said, [...] "it was so urgent. To me, it was a complete cry in every direction. It really was a landmark." [...] The single did raise the band's profile; a week after its release the band gained its first major live reviews in the music press, which in turn led to their first radio session with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde {{started his}} review by recalling the {{irritation}} the film caused upon its world premiere in Cannes, and compared the cut {{he had seen}} there to the final version: [...] "In all honesty, the <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> not jump to my eyes. Of course, the film seems more consistent, {{but that may be}} because we've already traveled this maze once. While leaving, we might remain calmer, but still amazed by the mixture of exuberant invention and puerility." [...] A positive review came from L'Express, written by Laurent Djian, who compared the film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He applauded how he found the strobe lights hypnotising in a way that influenced the perception of time. [...] "In 2010, no other filmmaker [...] than Gaspar No√© can shoot with such mastery, nor draw us into a vortex of sensations as vertiginous." [...] Ouest-Frances critic, on the other hand, was immensely bored by the film, and called it [...] "a padding of simple ideas, stereotypes and cliches in a heap of contrived and vain images which think they're technical prowess. Soporific cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|The Smiths's debut single was [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] (May 1983); {{it failed}} to chart.

In 1984 the band reached number twelve in the UK with the single [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> It Make?" [...] and went to number two on the UK Albums Chart with their debut album, The Smiths. Their next three singles all went into the top twenty of the charts in the UK, helping to consolidate their previous chart success. The next studio album, Meat Is Murder (1985), {{reached the top of}} the British charts; the only single to be released from the album, [...] "That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore" [...] (1985), failed to break into the UK Top 40. The Smiths' next six singles all went to higher than number thirty in the UK, and their third album, The Queen Is Dead (1986), climbed to number two in the UK.|$|E
500|$|In his Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time, {{historian}} Reinhart Koselleck discusses Altdorfer's {{representation of}} time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: [...] "...for , 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not {{because he does not}} know the difference, but because the <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> not matter... The Alexanderschlacht, in other words, exemplifies a premodern, untemporalized sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an eschatological vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same... In such a system there can be no event as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group's cover artwork had a {{distinctive}} visual style and often featured images {{of film and}} pop stars, usually in duotone.

(Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for [...] "What <b>Difference</b> <b>Does</b> It Make?", mimicking the pose of the original subject, British actor Terence Stamp, after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in cult film stars (Stamp, Alain Delon, Jean Marais, Warhol prot√©g√© Joe Dallesandro, James Dean); figures from sixties British popular culture (Viv Nicholson, Pat Phoenix, Yootha Joyce, Shelagh Delaney); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.|$|E
