The poem quickly captured the popular imagination, and achieved fame in the Indian subcontinent that has lasted for over two centuries.

50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the die cavity. Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the die cavity. In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the <b>flash</b> <b>material</b> to deformation resistance. As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill the die cavity more effectively - even intricate parts of the die cavity is filled.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{earthquakes}} in Japan. If a large earthquake were to occur, {{it is necessary}} to consider how pipelines such as: gas, sewage, telecommunications, and so on are restored quickly. At that time, damaged gas pipelines are very dangerous because fire in large areas could be caused by the leakage of gas from the damaged pipeline. Accordingly, it is necessary for gas companies to stop the supply of gas to houses over a large area. Once the gas supply is stopped, there is a considerable amount of time to repair the pipelines over the area. For this reason, a quick method for restoring damaged gas pipelines would be useful after an earthquake. Recently, we have been developing new <b>flash</b> setting <b>material</b> for the damaged gas pipeline by an injection into the house connection of gas when the gas supply is stopped quickly in an emergency.

40|$|Abstract. In {{times of}} {{increasing}} international business competition forging companies try {{to increase their}} competitiveness by optimization of different factors such as efficient use of resources in the forging process, optimization of processes or managing costs. In common forging processes for geometrically complicated parts such as crankshafts, an excess on <b>material</b> (<b>flash)</b> is technically needed to produce a good part, which results often in a material utilization between 60 % and 80 %. But the material costs in forging represent up to 50 % of the total production costs. By decreasing the <b>flash</b> ratio, the <b>material</b> usage and production costs in forging operations can be reduced significantly, helping to increase the competitiveness of companies. Innovative approaches are required, to achieve a significant reduction {{of the amount of}} flash in the forging of complicated parts like crankshafts. For a crankshaft, {{the development of a new}} forging sequence was necessary, to achieve the reduction of flash. This development was performed for an industrial two-cylinder crankshaft, based on finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. The new forging sequence consists of three flashless preforming operations, an induction reheating followed by a multidirectional forging and the final forging. By use of this forging sequence the flash ratio was reduced from about 54 % to less than 10 %. The whole forging sequence was set up in an industrial environment and the feasibility of this process chain was proven. Due to the huge reduction of the <b>flash</b> ratio, <b>material</b> as well as energy can be saved from now on, thus increasing the competitiveness of the company...|$|R
