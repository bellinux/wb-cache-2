5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a message he left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E

China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the demise}} of {{apartheid}} the ruling African National Congress <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> replace the Springbok across all national teams, as emblem of the racially segregated sporting codes, with a neutral symbol that would represent a decisive break with a repressive past. The King Protea as South Africa's national flower was chosen for this purpose, so that the national cricket team {{became known as the}} Proteas, for example. A similar change was envisioned for the national rugby squad's springbok emblem. Paul Roos's team had first introduced the Springbok in 1906, and it had promoted a measure of unity among white English and Afrikaans-speaking players after the two Anglo-Boer Wars of the late 19th century.|$|E

The next month, O'Connor appeared on Dr. Phil on the show's 16th season debut episode.

He also said that there's a possibility of Snow Patrol touring Asia in 2010. Lead singer Gary Lightbody has written on the band's website that they'll be returning to headline their own mini-festival at Ward Park next year. He has also revealed that it will be one of few concerts they'll play in the UK and Ireland in 2010, as they intend not to play any festivals and only [...] "special occasions".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Riki {{joined the}} staff at Northamptonshire county cricket club where he {{impressed}} in the second eleven producing several noticeable scores. This led to him being selected for the MCC in 2004 {{and in the first}} team of Nottinghamshire {{for the start of the}} 2011 season. In 2004, he established himself as a first class player, and scored his first century at the age of 19 against Somerset. In 2007, [...] he became qualified to play for England which is what he <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do from an early age. Being a keen Hockey player (playing for Northampton Lions and the University of Northampton teams) helps him to play a variety of shots including the Reverse sweep for which he is well known. He is a fairly attacking player especially in one day cricket, where he has one century to date. On 7 November 2008, Wessels signed a new contract extension along with fellow Northamptonshire wicket keeper Niall O'Brien, keeping Riki at the club until 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Ajram's {{first album}} which was fully {{dedicated}} to children included {{a variety of}} songs aimed towards teaching children good values and morals, something she <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do for a long time. The music video was her second cooperation with Said El Marouk and featured four songs from her album, the most successful of which were [...] "Shakhbat Shakhabit" [...] & [...] "Shater Shater". Ajram performed these songs at several fund-raising events for children and other children's events, such as the children's TV channel MBC3, and the children's entertainment TV Show [...] "Star Zghar". She then filmed with Fadi Haddad, the director of photography of her previous works with El Marouk, a video for the song [...] "Risala Lil Aalam" [...] (A Message to the World) which talks about world peace. The video was released on May 25, 2008, the day the Lebanese president General Michel Suleiman was elected ending a deadlock that lasted since November. It was the first video for Ajram that had an entirely graphical world that implied the suffering of children worldwide {{and the need to}} bring out a more colorful and happy world for them. Old rumors claimed that the video was presented to the UNICEF.|$|E
2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E

2500|$|Queen {{said that}} to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, {{she would have to}} deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, [...] "God blessed me with a {{powerful}} voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice." [...] Queen also stated that her achievements are all {{due to the fact that}} she is an artist who, “always [...] something to say, something to contribute. [...] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [...] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say”. She created music people's bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment with lyric like in [...] "Quiero Baliar" [...] where she states [...] "Yo quire bailar/Tu quires sudar/Y pegarte a mi/El cuerpo rozar/Yo the dig si tu me suedes provocar/Eso no quiere decir qui pa la came voy". In these lyric she explicitly states she wants to dance, and her partner wants to sweat, and as long as she gives her partner the go ahead they can provoke her, but it still does not give her partner permission to think she is sexually bound to them, because according to Ivy, that is a common misunderstanding when regarding certain forms of reggaeton dance. Since beginning her career, Queen <b>has</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create and compose songs [...] "that have some kind of subject matter" [...] so that people understand the concept and message. Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak. Queen says she writes songs that [...] "put bad men in their places or stand up for the single mothers". In [...] "Que Lloren" [...] she discusses romance from a woman's perspective while belittling the stereotype that men shouldn't cry or show emotions. In [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] she [...] "berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him." [...] "Mi Barrio" [...] is a socio-political charged song which criticizes [...] "the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico". Queen compared the song to [...] "Corazones" [...] by Daddy Yankee from his album Barrio Fino.|$|E
