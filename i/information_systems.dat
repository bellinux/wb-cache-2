40|$|While {{insufficient}} {{flexibility of}} an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> {{to support a}} business process precludes {{the use of the}} system in certain cases, excessive flexibility of an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> can limit the usability of the system (Silver 1991), in addition to presenting an unnecessary investment. Despite a wealth of research on flexibility and its impacts on organizations and business processes (esp. manufacturing), the value of flexibility of an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> and the price at which it comes have rarely been included into the analysis, with the result that guidelines to determine an appropriate level of flexibility of an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to support a given business process have not been developed. To support decisions regarding <b>information</b> <b>system</b> flexibility, the current paper presents an optimization model to relate business process characteristics (uncertainty, variability, and time−criticality) with two basic types of <b>information</b> <b>system</b> flexibility (built−in flexibility to use the <b>information</b> <b>system</b> and flexibility to change the <b>information</b> <b>system).</b> Based on an analysis of the model, we conclude that the focus of <b>information</b> <b>system</b> management should be on flexibility to change the <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in order to support processes of high uncertainty, while situations of low uncertainty tend to call for a focus on built−in flexibility to use the <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The model also shows that very high process variability can limit the value of investments in an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> altogether, thus, improving the importance of careful flexibility and investment management, while a high level of time−criticality generally tends to increase the benefits of using an <b>information</b> <b>system</b> over manual processing...|$|R
