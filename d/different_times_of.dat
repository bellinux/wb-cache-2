5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but {{they are capable of}} interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so {{at any given}} Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands {{to hundreds of thousands}} of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time.

Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> life. Pleased with the effect he achieved {{with the return}} of Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E

5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than {{each of the two}} component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the reproducibility of GA measurement by 99 m Tc-pertechnetate SPECT at the same and <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day. Methods Three GA studies were performed in each of 20 healthy volunteers (9 males, age 35 ± 9 years), 2 studies in the morning and 1 study in the afternoon. Each study was performed on separate days at least 3 days apart, in random order. The fasting gastric scintigraphy images were acquired using SPECT at 30 minutes after iv 99 m Tc-pertechnetate. Then, the scintigraphic images were acquired 50 minutes after liquid meal (250 mL, Ensure Ⓡ) ingestions. Gastric volumes were calculated from transaxial gastric im-ages using Image J software. The GA was defined as the maximum postprandial gastric volume minus fasting gastric volume. Results GA measurement by SPECT show good reproducibility at both the same and <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day.

The most common terms found within the books are 'Twolegs' (humans), 'kittypets' (house cats), 'monsters' (cars), 'the Thunderpath' (a road) or 'the horseplace' (a stable). The cats also have their own terms for time and measurement, such as sundown or moonhigh representing <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> day according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged {{females in the}} autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
