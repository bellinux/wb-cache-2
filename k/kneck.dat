50|$|Mercy, who {{has engaged}} Krantz {{to offer his}} {{services}} to Shirley in order to spy on him, calls him into her office to demand a report. During their conversation, she tells him {{that his mother had}} lived with her in Blackpool, that her name was not Frannie Krantz but Frannie Poole (she had taken her pseudonym from a conductor named Otto Krantz) and that she had left following a rape. Kranz goes to Finch and accuses him of the rape, but Finch says that it was his brother, Van <b>Kneck,</b> and that Krantz is the product of that rape. Krantz goes to Van <b>Kneck</b> and holds him at gunpoint, but Van <b>Kneck</b> tells him that he cannot be his father, because he has had prosthetic testicles from the age of ten. Meanwhile, Van <b>Kneck</b> and Shirley have teamed up to deal with Mercy, and Van <b>Kneck</b> has employed the services of two Finnish brothers. The first brother (Ewan Bailey) arrives and is treated to a cabaret and drinks, but makes extravagant demands, including a girl. He picks Lola out of a brochure of Mercy's girls. Lola at first agrees to have sex with him, but once in the room changes her mind. When he tries to rape her, she takes up his gun and shoots him in the head, chest and foot. In a panic, because the second brother is due, Shirley and Kranz decide they have to allow him to be seen, apparently alive, and then fake his death in a drowning accident. This is a problem because he has two bullet wounds in the head and half his foot is blown off, but the taxidermist Ambrose Chapfel comes to the rescue, and they are able to carry of the deception.|$|E
5000|$|A prudish couple, Dudley (Kris Marshall) and Lola (Sarah Smart) {{arrive in}} Blackpool by bus from Stoke-on-Trent, and find {{themselves}} in a seedy boarding house run by the sinister Leo Finch (Philip Jackson). At the same time Carter Krantz (Daniel Mays) arrives from London, thrown out of a car naked and carrying only a key and a piece of paper with the name [...] "Ambrose Chapel". He thinks that this is a man responsible for his mother's murder, but after roughing up an innocent taxidermist, Ambrose Chapfel, (Mark Gatiss), he discovers it is actually a disused church, now a nightclub called [...] "Sins" [...] which is run by Shirley Woolf (Ian Puleston-Davies). Shirley and his second wife Connie (Frances Barber) are in conflict with Shirley's mother Mercy (Judy Parfitt), the wheelchair-bound owner of a lapdancing club. Meanwhile, the mayor of Blackpool, Onan Van <b>Kneck</b> (Roy Barraclough) has launched a campaign to clean up the town, but is constantly harangued by journalist Ken Cryer (Simon Greenall), who accuses Van <b>Kneck</b> himself of corruption.|$|E
