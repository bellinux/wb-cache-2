5|$|Even in {{the wake}} of major companies' refusal to support the project, Madsen and Andersen {{continued}} to research archives in England, Germany and Sweden. In 2005, however, German films about World War II started to become popular, and several German companies became interested in the idea for the film. It became a co-production between Denmark and Germany, with three companies—Nimbus Film, Wüste Film and Babelsberg Studio—producing it. Filming took place at the Babelsberg locations in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany, and large parts of the film were shot at locations in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague, Czech Republic. It received a €342,000 ($460,000) grant from the German Film Fund for its total budget of more than 45million <b>Danish</b> <b>kroner</b> (or $7.6million), making it the most expensive Danish film produced to that date.|$|E

40|$|Background: Until recently, {{there have}} not been any {{facilities}} {{for the treatment of}} chronic renalfailure with dialyses in Greenland. Patients in haemodialysis had to move to Copenhagen for treatment at Rigshospitalet. Furthermore, patients in peritoneal dialysis were seen at Rigshospitalet for check up visits regularly. Thus, patients either had to move to Denmark on a permanent basis for treatment, or regularly travel to Denmark for control visits. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the economic consequences of establishing dialysis treatment for patients with chronic renal failure at Dronning Ingrid Hospital in Nuuk, Greenland. Methods: Based on a suggestion from a working group on how to organise dialysis facilities in Nuuk, the expected costs of establishing and managing chronic renal failure were estimated and compared to those if disease management continued as usual. Furthermore, in a survey to 500 persons aged 18 years or older living in Greenland, the societal value of establishing and offering treatment for chronic renal failure in Nuuk were examined with a discrete choice experiment. Results: The additional costs of establishing and running dialysis treatment in Greenland compared with usual care were estimated to four million <b>Danish</b> <b>kroners</b> per year. From 206 respondents in the survey, it was estimated that the value of dialysis facilities in Nuuk was 5. 7 million <b>Danish</b> <b>kroners</b> per year. Conclusion: The results from this study suggest that the societal benefits of establishing and running dialysis facilities may exceed the additional costs of such an alternativeStated preference; discrete choice; chronic renal failure...|$|R

One fire spread to a nearby kindergarten but was quickly extinguished. In a secondary school, the library and media room were ransacked and books and computers were burned on the street. The cost of the damages at the school was estimated to be around 1 million <b>Danish</b> <b>kroner</b> (133,000 euros).|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} studied {{memory for}} {{the appearance of}} a <b>Danish</b> 20 <b>kroner</b> coin. The coin bears the portrait of Queen Margrethe II in profile, facing to the right. Previous studies have examined memory for British coins, which similarly bear a right-facing portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. They have revealed the occurrence of a mnemonic illusion, in that British people tend to believe the portrait faces left. This finding has been attributed to the occurrence of a joint coin-stamp schema. British stamps bear a left-facing profile of the Queen, and it is possible that information from the stamp predominates {{in the formation of the}} schema. In the case of Denmark, however, stamps bear a full-face portrait of the Queen. Nevertheless, the present experiments showed that the Coin Head Illusion is also found in Denmark. That is, the number of participants recalling the Queen's head as facing to the right was significantly below even the chance level of 50 %. Further, this result occurred both for residents of Denmark and for visitors to Denmark. These findings suggest that the bias underlying the Coin Head Illusion may be a more general one than that envisaged by the joint coin-stamp schema hypothesis...|$|R
