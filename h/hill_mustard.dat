50|$|The Florida Museum of Natural History defines three {{communities}} on the Florida reefs. The hardbottom community lies {{closest to the}} Florida Keys and consists primarily of algae, sea fans (gorgonians) and stony corals growing on limestone rock that has a thin covering of sand. The stony corals in hardbottom communities include Smooth Starlet coral (Siderastrea radians), <b>Mustard</b> <b>Hill</b> Coral (Porites astreoides), Golfball coral (Favia fragum), Elliptical Star coral (Dichocoenia stokesii) and Common Brain coral (Diploria strigosa). Hardbottom provides habitat for anemones, mollusks, crabs, spiny lobsters, seastars, sea cucumbers, tunicates and various fish, including grunts (Haemulon spp.), snappers (Lutjanus spp.), groupers (Epinephelus spp.), tangs (Acanthurus coeruleus), Ocean surgeon (Acanthurus bahianus) and Great barracuda (Spyraena barracuda).|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{tested the}} {{feasibility}} of using cellular diagnostics to link land-based sources of pollution with coral reef degradation. We collected tissue samples of <b>mustard</b> <b>hill</b> coral (Porites astreiodes) from four paired inshore and offshore stations off Broward Country, FL: 1) control sites (FTL 1 and FTL 3) monitored by Broward County Department of Environmental Protection, 2) a sewage outfall (Hollywood Outfall: HWO 2 and HWO 3), 3) an inlet mouth (Port Everglades: PE 2 and PE 3), and 4) a sewage outfall adjacent to an inlet mouth (Hillsborough Inlet: HI 2 and HI 3). Coral cover was < 4 % at all sites and cluster analysis grouped all inshore sites (except HI) together based on having the least bare substrate and the most Lyngbya. Rates of sampling lesion regeneration were significantly greater than zero only at three inshore sites and the offshore biomonitoring control site. Cellular diagnostics revealed that corals at all sites were stressed compared to colonies from a more pristine site in the Bahamas. Offshore corals consistently had higher accumulations of stress markers than inshore colonies. Stress responses of corals from HWO and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary were consistent with sewage exposure, while responses of offshore colonies wer...|$|R
50|$|Sisymbrium altissimum is {{a species}} of Sisymbrium. The plant is native to {{the western part of}} the Mediterranean Basin in Europe and Northern Africa and is widely {{naturalized}} throughout most of the world, including all of North America. It was probably introduced into North America by a contaminant crop seed. The plant grows in soils of all , even sand. The plant germinates in winter or early spring. The blooming time is lengthy, and after maturity the plant forms a tumbleweed. Common names of the plant include Jim <b>Hill</b> <b>mustard,</b> after James J. Hill, a Canadian-American railroad magnate, tall tumblemustard, tall mustard, tumble mustard, tumbleweed mustard, tall sisymbrium, and tall hedge mustard.|$|E
40|$|A {{virus was}} isolated, using {{mechanical}} inoculation, from <b>hill</b> <b>mustard</b> (Bunias orientalis L.) plants exhibiting yellow mottling and blistering on leaves, which were frequently accompanied by asymmetric leaf narrowing.

In the sap, it maintained infectivity for 3 - 4 days and lost it after heating for 10 min. at a temperature of 55 - 60 o C or when diluted with water at 10 - 3.

40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} {{combinations}} {{of the conventional}} chemotherapeutic agent 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea (CCNU) and nitroimidazole radiation sensitizers was evaluated in female C 3 H mice. Tumour response to single-agent or combination therapy was assessed in a tumour growth-delay assay. In the KHT sarcoma the simultaneous addition of misonidazole (MISO) was found to increase significantly the tumour growth delay resulting from CCNU treatment. The observed enhancement ratios (ER) increased with MISO dose, and ranged from 1 x 3 to 1 - 9 for sensitizer doses of 0 - 25 - 1 l 0 mg/g. The combination of CCNU and 1 - 0 or 0 - 5 mg/g MISO in the RIF- 1 tumour or the MT- 1 tumour produced ERs of- 2 - 0 and- 15 respectively. In the KHT sarcoma a series of other nitroimidazole sensitizers, including Ro- 05 - 9963, SR- 2555, SR- 2508 and metronidazole (METRO), were also evaluated at equimolar doses (5 mmol/kg) in combination with a 20 mg/kg dose of CCNU. Unlike MISO, these compounds in general failed to enhance the CCNU cytotoxicity in this tumour model. However, SR- 2508 did enhance {{the response of the}} RIF- 1 tumour to large single doses of CCNU, though not as much as MISO. Normal-tissue toxicity was determined using peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts 3 days after treatment. CCNU doses of 10 - 50 mg/kg given either alone or in simultaneous combination with 0 5 or 1 - 0 mg/g MISO were studied. WBC toxicity increased with CCNU dose, but the addition of MISO at either dose did not significantly enhance this normal-tissue toxicity. THERE HAS RECENTLY been considerable interest in combining conventional chemotherapeutic agents and chemical radiation sensitizers in the treatment of animal tumour models. Such studies have been initiated because of evidence from both in vitro and in vivo tumour systems which has suggested that hypoxic tumour cells may be preferentially spared by some anti-tumour agents such as 1, 3 -bis(2 chloroethyl) -l-nitrosourea (BCNU) Adriamycin, and nitrogen <b>mustard</b> (<b>Hill</b> &...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} rapid heating {{and its effects}} on {{silcrete}} is widely debated, and studies have arrived at competing conclusions regarding factors that determine the success of silcrete rapid heating. Clarifying the potential effect of these various factors is important for furthering our understanding of the role of intentional heat treatment as an engineering strategy employed by early humans for modifying the flaking potential of lithic materials. To this end, this study tests for potential inter- and intra-source variation in the overall fracture rates of silcrete heated under a controlled, rapid heating environment. The tested silcrete samples were collected from a range of locations within Australia and South Africa; the primary test material were from Bannister’s Point/Mollymook and Bendalong Point on the New South Wales South Coast, and the secondary material came from <b>Mustard</b> <b>Hill</b> and Quartz Valley in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Following Mercieca and Hiscock (2008), silcrete samples were prepared in standardised dimensions and heated rapidly under multiple temperature gradients. Prior to heating, the silcrete samples were characterised by a range of attributes, including weight, material composition, and the block of stone from which the sample was cut. In addition, the geochemical property of a subset of the silcrete samples was examined by non-destructive X-ray florescence. Silcrete samples were placed in an oven pre-heated to 550, 600 and 700 degrees Celsius for a period of one hour before gradual cooling. The degree of heat fracture was quantified by comparing the weight of the largest remaining stone of each heated sample to their corresponding mass prior to heating. Statistical analyses were carried out to examine the influence of sample volume, temperature, and source on the degree of heat-induced fracture. While the results suggest that sample volume plays a significant role in influencing silcrete heat fracture, the effect varies considerably by source. Specifically, samples from Bendalong Point displayed far greater heat resistance than those of Bannister’s Point/Mollymook. This trend of inter-source variation was also apparent in the South African material, although limited sample size restricts the assessment to visual inspection only. The finding also showed intra-source variation, where different blocks of stone from a single source displayed significant difference in heat fracture ii under identical conditions. Contrary to expectation, maximum temperature was shown to have an insignificant role on heat fracture variation when the influence of source and sample dimension is controlled...|$|R
