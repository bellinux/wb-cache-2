500|$|In August 2003, Smith {{released}} a collaborative gospel album with country artists Barbara Fairchild and Sharon White called Love Never Fails on Daywind Records. In {{an interview with}} Country Stars Central, Smith {{said that she was}} ill with the stomach flu while recording the album, but, [...] still enjoyed making the record, Produced by country and bluegrass artist Ricky Skaggs (White's husband), the album received a nomination from the Dove Awards. The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> are fans any of these three singers, {{this is kind of a}} treat.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Crystal was {{received}} well by critics, although many commented {{that there were}} just not enough new additions and features to significantly set it apart from Pokémon Gold and Silver. Craig Harris of IGN gave the game an [...] "outstanding" [...] 9 out of 10 stating, [...] "The final (hopefully) Game Boy Color edition is definitely the version to get if you aren't already one of the upteenth billion owners of the previous games, with Crystals slight updates to the design and graphics. But there's not much in this edition {{that makes it a}} [...] "must buy" [...] <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> already own a copy or two of the previous editions".

500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter was {{positive}} {{of all the}} changes made to the original that showcased Raven's considerable efforts, but stated that the game was still at its core one from 2007. He cited the story as an example, saying that the game's campaign was still worth playing despite having been topped by its competition. Carter further noted that the cast were [...] "nothing more than warm bodies at points", but opined that {{the crux of the}} story and the relationship between main protagonist Soap and Captain Price was [...] "worth the price of admission". Alternatively, he found the multiplayer to be timeless, and that the design of each map held up well and felt justified. He compared the multiplayer to those offered by other first-person shooter games, such as the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, stating [...] "There's a nice, comfortable balance between the two philosophies, to the point where it's not too alienating <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> didn't grow up with twichy FPSes or feel like dedicating the time to learning {{the ins and outs of}} breaching and clearing each and every room, knocking on permadeath's door on every match." ...|$|E

6000|$|You, {{little sister}} doll, were the heroine. You {{lived in the}} white-washed cottage, all {{honeysuckle}} and clematis without--earwiggy and damp within, maybe. How pretty you always looked in your simple, neatly-fitting print dress. How good you were! How nobly you bore your poverty. How patient you were under your many wrongs. You never harboured an evil thought, a revengeful wish--never, little doll? Were there never moments when you longed to play the wicked woman's part, live {{in a room with}} many doors, be-clad in furs and jewels, with lovers galore at your feet? In those long winter evenings? the household work is done--the greasy dishes washed, the floor scrubbed; the excellent child is asleep in the corner; the one-and-elevenpenny lamp sheds its dismal light on the darned table-cloth; you sit, busy at your coarse sewing, waiting for Hero Dick, knowing--guessing, at least, where he is--! Yes, dear, I remember your fine speeches, when you told her, in stirring language the gallery cheered to the echo, what you thought of her and of such women as she; when, lifting your hand to heaven, you declared you were happier in your attic, working your fingers to the bone, than she in her gilded salon--I think [...] "gilded salon" [...] was the term, was it not?--furnished by sin. But speaking of yourself, weak little sister doll, not of your fine speeches, the gallery listening, did you not, in your secret heart, envy her? Did you never, before blowing out the one candle, stand for a minute in front of the cracked glass, and think to yourself that you, too, would look well in low-cut dresses from Paris, the diamonds flashing on your white smooth skin? Did you never, toiling home through the mud, bearing your bundle of needlework, feel bitter with the wages of virtue, as she splashed you, passing by in her carriage? Alone, over your cup of weak tea, did you never feel tempted to pay the price for champagne suppers, and gaiety, and admiration? Ah, yes, it is easy <b>for</b> <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> have had their good time, to prepare copybooks for weary little inkstained fingers, longing for play. The fine maxims sound such cant when we are in that mood, do they not? You, too, were young and handsome: did the author of the play think you were never hungry for the good things of life? Did he think that reading tracts to crotchety old women was joy to a full-blooded girl in her twenties? Why should SHE have all the love, and all the laughter? How fortunate that the villain, the Wicked Baronet, never opened the cottage door at that moment, eh, dear! He always came when you were strong, when you felt that you could denounce him, and scorn his temptations. Would that the villain came to all of us at such time; then we would all, perhaps, be heroes and heroines.|$|E

50|$|The White Racial Identity Model was {{developed}} by psychologist Janet Helms in 1990.

In addition, Helms presented the idea that all people have a racial identity in some way that is influenced by power and privilege.|$|E
