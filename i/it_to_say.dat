5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> <b>say</b> John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he ought to}} have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

[...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels.

500|$|Later critics {{believed}} {{that it is possible}} that Richardson's work failed because the story deals with a [...] "good man" [...] instead of a [...] "rake", which prompted Richardson's biographers Thomas Eaves and Ben Kimpel to claim, this [...] "might account for the rather uneasy relationship between the story of the novel and the character of its hero, who is never credible in his double love – or in any love." [...] Flynn agrees that this possibility is an [...] "attractive one", and conditions <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "it is at least certain that the deadly weighted character of Sir Charles stifles the dramatic action of the book." [...] John Mullan suggests that the problem stems from Grandison's role as a hero when he says, [...] "his hero is able to display his virtue in action; as a consequence, Sir Charles Grandison presents its protagonist without the minutely analyzed reflexes of emotion that brought his heroines to life." ...|$|E
500|$|A Cajun mutant thief who has {{the ability}} to convert the {{potential}} energy of any object he touches into kinetic energy, forcing it to explode. The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that.

Speaking {{of the first two}} episodes, Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise, saying, [...] "Quite simply, in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made.

[...] Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace [...] "leisurely", but [...] "a pleasant change from the norm", and called Cox's performance [...] "divided", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil.
