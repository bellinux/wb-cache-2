Strachan's reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, My Life in Football, was one of being [...] "surprised and disappointed", although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan's Coventry City in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County. By 2006 they appeared to have [...] "declared something of a truce", ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan's Celtic.|$|E

It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer.

The next morning we talked of it again, when I found he was fully satisfied, and, smiling, said he hoped <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> money and <b>not</b> tell him of it, and that I had promised him otherwise. I told him I had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady's talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with; but I supposed she wanted what I owed her, which was about eight guineas, which I had resolved to give her, and had accordingly given it her the same night she talked so foolishly.|$|R

40|$|The {{title and}} the table of {{contents}} of this thesis, in one respect, fully convey its contents, substance, and plan. Here is expounded, surveyed, and critically appraised certain branches of Macmurray's thought. Very little, if any, of either Macmurray or his work {{has been written about}} in this way, if at all. So this thesis is, as it should be, a unique and original contribution to knowledge and scholarship. The programme and procedure has been to expound his ideas under suitable headings according to subject matter, and to follow this [...] - from time to time [...] - with a relevant appraisement, rather than intersperse criticism with exposition. But Macmurray's thought is so broad, so encompassing, so diverse and intricate that it must never be imagined that adequate justice has been, or could be, done to the subjects contained in the title in such a short compass. Thus whilst not exhaustively covering the subject in exposition, which would require at least ten thesis of this length, it has also not been possible to raise, discuss, and positively answer numerous questions which frequently come to mind as we read both the original texts and this exposition of them. Many, of course, have been raised, researched, met, and answered. But many more must wait for further researches, and for more space to consider and probe them. The above has had to be made clear for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> it to be thought that this is, and was meant to be, a definitive work in the selected field of Macmurray's ideas...|$|R

He was the most loving husband in the world, I said, and was always anxious to know what he could do for me more than he was already doing; but {{when we were in the}} city he did like to go out in the evenings, and I thought he went to his club too often. Of course, I said, I did not say anything to him about it, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> him to think that I desired him to deny himself the company of other gentlemen; but the habit of club attendance was one that might grow on a man, especially a young one, and there were a good many other things that might result from it, such as excessive smoking. So I had thought it well to offer him additional inducements for spending his evenings at home, and I had begun a regular system of reading aloud. It had proved very beneficial to both of us, for I chose good, standard books; and although he sometimes went to sleep, that was to be expected, for Bernard was a hard-working man. As for myself, I liked this reading aloud very much, although at first it was rather tiresome, as I had never been used to it. Then I asked her if she liked reading aloud--it is such a good way of giving pleasure to others at the same time that you are pleasing yourself. She smiled, and said she was very fond of reading aloud.|$|R
