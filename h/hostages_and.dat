5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining <b>hostages,</b> <b>and</b> killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard {{was part of}} the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take <b>hostages,</b> <b>and</b> use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{there was}} a hostage crisis in Mikkeli, when a bank robber drove from Helsinki to Mikkeli with three <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> parked there. When the police shot at the hostage taker's car, he {{exploded}} the car, killing himself and one hostage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiators are police {{officers}} who {{have been trained to}} respond to <b>and</b> resolve <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis incidents. They are often required to respond to highly-pressurised and emotive incidents that may last for protracted periods of time and are likely to encounter situations whereby their actions could play a role in whether individuals live or die. The first aim of the current thesis was to identify whether negotiators in the United Kingdom (UK) possess certain traits or characteristics that serve to enable them to perform their role effectively and differentiate them from the wider police population. The first phase of the research involved a quantitative cross-sectional comparison of a sample of <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiators (n = 117) with a sample of non-negotiator {{police officers}} (n = 118) from 21 UK forces and a sample of students (n = 203) utilising a psychometric test battery measuring five constructs previously identified within the literature as playing a role in success within occupational settings: Personality, Coping Style, Cognitive Emotion Regulation, Decision-Making Style and Emotional Intelligence. The findings refuted the existence of a “unique <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiator profile” but confirmed the existence of a unique “police officer profile” by demonstrating significant differences between both police samples and the student sample in relation to all constructs measured. These findings are discussed with reference to the implications for the selection, training and CPD of UK negotiators. <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiation is one of many options available to police incident commanders and is well-established as an effective means of resolving <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis incidents. Whilst there is a plethora of published literature relating to the entity of <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiation, the majority of this literature has been developed within the United States of America (USA), on the basis of USA negotiator deployments and experiences. The second aim, therefore, was to provide an insight into the discipline of negotiation in the UK by conducting a constructivist grounded theory analysis of the experiences of negotiators as derived from semi-structured interviews with 15 negotiators from nine UK police forces. The findings allowed for the development of five grounded theoretical micro-models: a) The Nature and Characteristics of UK <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> Crisis Negotiation, b) The UK <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> Crisis Negotiator Journey, c) The UK-Centric D. I. A. M. O. N. D. Procedural Model of <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> Crisis Negotiation, d) The UK <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> Crisis Negotiator Experience, and e) The Self-Perceived Successful UK <b>Hostage</b> <b>and</b> Crisis Negotiator Profile. These micro-models are discussed with reference to their implications for <b>hostage</b> <b>and</b> crisis negotiation policy and practice in a UK-centric context...|$|R

5|$|The Knights {{proceeded}} to rebuild and strengthen castles {{destroyed by the}} Prussians. A number of Prussians escaped either to Sudovia or to Lithuania, or were resettled by the Knights. Many free peasants were made into serfs. Local nobles had to convert and give <b>hostages,</b> <b>and</b> {{only a few of}} them were granted privileges to retain their noble status. From 1274 to 1283 the Teutonic Knights conquered Skalvians, Nadruvians, and Sudovians/Yotvingians.|$|E
5|$|The raid lasted {{seventeen}} {{minutes and}} involved 30–35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during the raid while the SAS killed {{all but one}} of the terrorists. The rescued <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy's back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.|$|E
5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E

5|$|Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{released}} by Electronic Arts (EA) in February 1992 for the Sega Genesis. The game {{was released on}} several other formats such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game {{was inspired by the}} Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Flann {{was chosen}} as the High King of Ireland, also known as King of Tara, {{following}} the death of his first cousin and stepfather Áed Findliath on 20 November 879. Flann's reign followed the usual pattern of Irish High Kings, beginning by levying <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> tribute from Leinster and then to wars with Munster, Ulster and Connacht. Flann was more successful than most kings of Ireland. However, rather than the military and diplomatic successes of his reign, it is his propaganda statements, in the form of monumental high crosses naming him and his father, as kings of Ireland, that are exceptional.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{rent the}} film Paint Your Wagon, expecting {{it to be}} a shoot-em-up Western. Homer is dismayed to find out that it is {{actually}} a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is baffled by this, saying that he ironically loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is not convinced. At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> leaves.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist mass murder. Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> {{threatened}} {{to blow up the}} building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E
5|$|In March 1826, a French-Canadian {{man named}} Methode, his Native American wife, and their {{children}} were gathering maple syrup in present-day Iowa, about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien, when they were murdered, apparently by a Ho-Chunk raiding party that had been passing through. The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims, who were targets of opportunity. Two Ho-Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford. After they escaped, U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho-Chunk <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> demanded that the Ho-Chunk tribe turn over the murderers.|$|E

5|$|On 11 July, NATO {{prepared}} for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, {{the first wave of}} the assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported this back to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end to the attacks.|$|E
5|$|To {{progress}} through the game, the player must venture through six large levels interconnected by a hub area. In each level, the player must complete multiple objectives and then exit the level via a portal. Objectives range from destroying objects to rescuing <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> defeating enemies, among others. Upon exiting a level, the player must either protect a totem from enemy forces or defeat a boss, or both, depending on which level the player was; the first three levels require the player to protect a totem, {{the fourth and fifth}} levels require the player to protect a totem and then defeat a boss, and the last level requires the player to defeat a boss. The game features an automap to help players navigate through the levels.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

5|$|Carlos {{arranged}} bus and plane {{travel for}} his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in Algiers and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, while NATO was {{planning}} {{a new strategy}} in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a ceasefire brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine; ARBiH) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske; VRS) expired and fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive around Sarajevo. In response, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot and began shelling targets around the city, prompting the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, to request NATO air strikes against the VRS. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump in the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. The mission {{was carried out by}} United States Air Force F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. In response, the VRS seized 377 UNPROFOR <b>hostages</b> <b>and</b> used them as human shields for a variety of potential targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina, forcing NATO to end the air strikes.|$|E
