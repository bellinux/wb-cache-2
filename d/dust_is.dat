5|$|The {{optical depth}} of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> the same—about 107–109kg. However the {{particle}} size distribution of the <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> somewhat shallower than in the Amalthea ring. It follows a power law with q< 2. In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be even smaller.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternative}} scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90AU from Epsilon Eridani {{and has an}} assumed mass of 10−3 times the mass of Earth. This <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice sublimation, located beyond 10AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles.|$|E

5|$|A Handful of <b>Dust</b> <b>is</b> a {{novel by}} the British writer Evelyn Waugh. First {{published}} in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous in the pre-World War II years. Commentators have, however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's Catholic postwar fiction.|$|E
5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. <b>Dust</b> <b>is</b> formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust.

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> flammable.|$|E
5|$|From <b>Dust</b> <b>is</b> a god video game, {{designed}} by Éric Chahi and developed by Ubisoft Montpellier. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. Described {{as a spiritual}} successor to Populous, the game revolves around The Breath, which was summoned by a tribe to help them seek and recover their lost knowledge. In the game, players, controlling a cursor, can manipulate matter such as lava, soil, and water. Players can help the tribespeople to overcome challenges including finding different totems and overcoming natural disasters. In addition to the story mode, the game features a Challenge mode which offers a shorter, but harder experience.|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{action of}} a series of mineral <b>dusts</b> has <b>been</b> studied using Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells obtained from three separate laboratories in the UK. The <b>dusts</b> which have <b>been</b> studied include samples of asbestos from the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer reference series and an internationally available sample of quartz (DQ 12). Besides comparing results obtained with the three different cells, two alternative methods of exposing the cells to the <b>dusts</b> <b>were</b> also compared. The toxicity assay employed uses the inhibition of colony formation from a single cell suspension as a measure of toxicity. The numbers of colonies which grow {{in the presence of the}} various concentrations of the <b>dusts</b> <b>are</b> expressed as percentages of the colonies which grow in the untreated control cultures. The absolute toxicity of a <b>dust</b> <b>was</b> found to depend principally on the method of exposing the cells to the dust. However, differences in the relative toxicities of the dusts depended on the source of the cells. The implications of these results for experiments in which Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells are used in in vitro test systems to assess the potential pathogenicity of mineral <b>dusts</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R

5|$|Star <b>Dust</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to}} have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of}} the glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the λ ring changed dramatically when it was observed in forward-scattered light in 1986. In this geometry the ring became the brightest feature of the Uranian ring system, outshining the ε ring. This observation, together with the wavelength dependence of the optical depth, indicates that the λ ring contains significant amount of micrometer-sized dust. The normal optical depth of this <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> 10−4–10−3. Observations in 2007 by the Keck telescope during the ring plane-crossing event confirmed this conclusion, because the λ ring {{became one of the}} brightest features in the Uranian ring system.|$|E

The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams of}} dust and gas each form their own {{distinct}} tail, pointing in slightly different directions. The tail of <b>dust</b> <b>is</b> {{left behind in the}} comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the type II or dust tail. At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. On occasions - such as when the Earth passes through a comet's orbital plane, a tail pointing in the opposite direction to the ion and dust tails called the antitail may be seen.|$|E
