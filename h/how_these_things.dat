5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
25|$|One {{study that}} {{looked at the}} abuse of street {{children}} in Jaipur City, India in 2009 provided new insight into the abuse that street children in India suffer by studying the types and prevalence of abuse and <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> were related to other factors. The street children in the study reported all five types of abuse: general abuse and neglect, health abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, and sexual abuse. Verbal and psychological abuse were reported the most. Older children and children with higher incomes were abused more than younger children and children with lower incomes, respectively.|$|E

6000|$|... 3. Faith sees more in {{a promise}} of God to help, than in all other things to hinder; but unbelief, {{notwithstanding}} God's promise, saith, <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> <b>things</b> be? (Rom 4:19-21; 2 Kings 7:2; John 3:11,12).|$|R
60|$|HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you {{any human}} sympathy? Don't you know <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.|$|E

60|$|Oh yes; some of {{them must}} have seen it. And yet when it came it seemed so quiet,--ever so quiet,--not {{a bit like the}} Northern Star mine and the oyster supper and the Mariposa band. It is strange <b>how</b> quiet <b>these</b> <b>things</b> look, the other way round.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{seemed to}} wonder, however, exactly <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> could be. [...] "He doesn't {{want you to}} give up anything?" [...] She looked as if swiftly {{thinking}} what Nanda MIGHT give up.|$|E
60|$|Then the unsophisticated youth {{would go}} away, his heart too full for words, but pondering <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> were, and by-and-by he would {{pass into the}} Meeson melting-pot and learn {{something}} about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Fawn, you know, is very particular. In sober earnest one cannot tell <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> operate; {{but they}} do operate gradually. One's friends are {{sometimes}} very glad of an excuse for not befriending one." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sean Gandert of Paste {{noted the}} {{struggle}} of trying to fit 40-minutes of ideas into 22 minutes and that [...] "The strange level of Orwellian doublespeak and strange standards are a magically weird affair and Community captured the essence of just <b>how</b> odd <b>these</b> <b>things</b> really are.

60|$|Before {{translating}} this to Sir Henry, {{who carried}} the light, I {{could not resist}} asking <b>how</b> she knew <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> if no one had entered the place since the white man, generations ago.|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY (with {{the utmost}} goodhumor). My dear Howard, not a bit. Of course you're right: you know <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> {{ought to be}} done. I'll do exactly what you tell me, and confirm {{everything}} you say.|$|E
60|$|But the glider {{brought me}} up smartly. I {{had to find}} out <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> went down the air, {{and the only way to}} find out is to go down with one. And for a time I wouldn't face it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And this'll be your second, and {{you know}} <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> are managed. No gentleman'll marry her because she runs after him. Girls as knows what they're about should let the gentlemen run after them. That's my {{way of looking at}} it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|ANDERSON. Well, it's {{all very}} puzzling--almost funny. It's curious <b>how</b> <b>these</b> little <b>things</b> strike us {{even in the}} most-- (he breaks off and begins putting on Richard's coat) I'd better take him his own coat. I know what he'll say-- (imitating Richard's sardonic manner) [...] "Anxious about my soul, Pastor, and also about your best coat." [...] Eh? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{an absurd}} faculty," [...] said he; [...] "I don't know that I have ever {{mentioned}} it to any one before. But when imminent danger is threatening me I get these strange forebodings. Of course it is absurd to-day in these peaceful surroundings. It only shows <b>how</b> queerly <b>these</b> <b>things</b> work. But {{it is the first}} time that it has deceived me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, you see, {{if we want}} {{a little}} more time, a horse may cast its shoe, {{or some of the}} baggage may be missing, or perhaps an {{important}} paper somehow gets mislaid. It is curious <b>how</b> often <b>these</b> <b>things</b> happen. Then, when they arrive here they find that I have, as usual, gone off for a fortnight's hunting among the mountains; and that, perhaps, my mother has started for Nerac.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was lucky}} you fell in with me, Teddy, for I know <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> are worked, an' {{can give you}} a good many {{pointers}} before the fair is over. Why, you'll have a first-class outfit for about half what it's worth." ...|$|E
6000|$|No one {{ventured to}} ask a {{question}} as to <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> came there. They contented themselves by eating heartily the good things provided, and Toto and Billina had their full share, you may be sure. After the meal was over, Aunt Em whispered to Dorothy: ...|$|E

40|$|If {{it can be}} ascertained {{experimentally}} {{that the}} 3 X 3 Majorana neutrino mass matrix M_nu has vanishing determinants for {{one or more of}} its 2 X 2 submatrices, it may be interpreted as supporting evidence for the theoretically well-known canonical seesaw mechanism.

60|$|<b>How</b> had <b>these</b> <b>things</b> {{escaped the}} Goths forty years before? We cannot tell. Perhaps the Gothic sack, which only lasted five days, was less {{complete}} than this one, which {{went on for}} fourteen days of unutterable horrors. The plunderers were not this time sturdy honest Goths; not even German slaves, mad to revenge themselves on their masters: they were Moors, Ausurian black savages, and all the pirates and cut-throats of the Mediterranean.|$|R
6000|$|Sherikov floundered. [...] "You know <b>how</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> are. I've {{taken my}} crew off it and tried robot workers.

60|$|She {{took her}} {{responsibilities}} lightly. When she spilled her tea on the pillow, she rubbed it carelessly with a handkerchief, {{and turned over}} the pillow. He would have felt guilty.

5000|$|Gavin brought Rudy Johnson, Jeron Wilson and Sean Sheffey; {{and then}} for me, I brought Marc Johnson, Rodney Mullen and, ahh, JB Gillett.

30|$|What we {{need now}} is a {{complete}} model of the life-course. Emotional wellbeing should be the central variable of interest – the ultimate criterion by which we judge {{the state of our}} society.

And we also need to know <b>how</b> <b>these</b> other <b>things</b> then affect emotional wellbeing.|$|R
