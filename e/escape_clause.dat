5|$|Hughes {{was sold}} to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record {{transfer}} fee of £5,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding £5 million would trigger an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be £15,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001–02 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.|$|E

Mee insisted on an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> in his contract provided if the arrangement did not work, which the club duly obliged. The position became permanent eleven months later, even though Arsenal were 14th in the league table. The club's fortunes changed under Mee however, as he started to bed in youth players. He led Arsenal to successive League Cup final appearances in 1968 and 1969, and ended the club's 17-year wait for silverware when his side beat Anderlecht in the 1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final. Mee's greatest triumph was the club's league and cup double of 1970–71, but he struggled to better that achievement, having made radical changes to a successful team.|$|E

The chapter provides an overview of flexibility mechanisms in international agreements and the role of such mechanisms in promoting or inhibiting international cooperation. Part I reviews the many flexibility devices available to treaty makers. It divides these tools into two broad categories: formal mechanisms (such as reservations, <b>escape</b> <b>clauses,</b> and withdrawal provisions) and informal practices (such as auto-interpretation, nonparticipation, and noncompliance). Part II reviews the international law and international relations scholarship on the design and use of treaty flexibility mechanisms, focusing on studies of exit and <b>escape</b> <b>clauses.</b> Part III highlights several conclusions that emerge from the burgeoning literature on treaty flexibility and suggests avenues for future research...|$|R

25|$|Chief {{executive}} Chris Robinson, who {{had been}} the chief proponent of the necessity of selling Tynecastle, agreed at the end of September 2004 to sell his 19.6% stake to Romanov. Romanov called an extraordinary general meeting in January 2005 so that the club could pass a motion to exercise the <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> in the deal with Cala Homes. The backing of Leslie Deans and the McGrail brothers meant that the motion was passed with over 70% support. The sale of Robinson's shares was completed on 2 February 2005 after Romanov made financial guarantees that the club could continue to trade without selling Tynecastle. This sale increased Romanov's stake to 29.9%, giving him effective control of the club. Romanov's takeover was welcomed by a fans representative.|$|E

Originally this was meant to happen during the summer of 2004, but was then delayed for a season. During this period, Hearts were a public limited company. Ownership of the club was very fractured, with no {{individual}} shareholder owning more than 20% of the club. This meant that minority shareholders, including supporters' groups and the McGrail brothers, could realistically hope to acquire other minority stakes in order to block the proposals to sell Tynecastle. In August 2004, Hearts {{made a deal}} to sell Tynecastle to Cala Homes (a housing developer), but the deal had an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> which meant that Hearts could withdraw from the deal before 31 January 2005 if a viable alternative could be found.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} merits of policy rules with <b>escape</b> <b>clauses,</b> {{analysing}} as an example fixed exchange rate systems that allow member countries the freedom to realign in periods of stress. Motivating this example is the debate within the European Monetary System over how quickly {{to move from the}} current regime of national currencies, linked by pegged but adjustable exchange rates, to a single European currency. The paper's main point is that while well-designed rules with <b>escape</b> <b>clauses</b> can raise society's welfare in principle, limited credibility makes it difficult for governments to implement such rules in practice. An EMS-type institution which presumably imposes a political cost on policy-makers who realign may lead to an optimal escape-clause equilibrium, but may just as well lead to alternative equilibria far inferior to an irrevocably fixed exchange rate. Countries can suffer periods in which no realignment occurs, yet unemployment, real wages, and ex post real interest rates remain persistently and sub-optimally high.

The 15-round fight {{would have taken}} place on July 26, 1971 in the Houston Astrodome but Chamberlain refused. The {{potential}} Chamberlain-Ali match was predicated on Ali beating Joe Frazier in a fight scheduled for early 1971. However, Frazier defeated Ali to hand Ali his first professional loss. As a result, Chamberlain declined the fight through a contractual <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> In a 1999 interview, Chamberlain stated that boxing trainer Cus D'Amato wanted to train him for the fight, and they offered Ali and him $5 million each to battle each other. Chamberlain checked back {{with his father and}} finally said no.

Another rumor had Howard being packaged with Rex Chapman and Don MacLean for Pippen. [...] On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection Carlos Rogers signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last first-round selection without a contract. He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an O'Hare Airport hotel while protracted talks continued. Howard's agent David Falk said that one of the main problems was that the Bullets wanted Howard to sign for a lower average salary than number six selection Sharone Wright. The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30million ($million in [...] dollars) offer. On November 17, Howard signed what was believed to be a 12-year, $37.5million ($million) contract. Howard's contract, which Sports Illustrated later said was an 11-year $36million ($million) deal, had an <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets.

40|$|MANY governments {{think they}} could not secure the support of {{domestic}} producer interests for the trade-liberalizing agreements they negotiate with other countries without provisions in them that permit a degree of flexibility in implementing the core obligations they undertake {{in the event of}} unforeseeable or even foreseeable problems. 1 Thus in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) there are "escape clauses" that, as exceptio ns to the rules, allow members to exceed their tariff bindings and impose import restrictions that would otherwise violate GATT articles. 2 The result is a constant tension between the rules drawn to permit limited exceptions to general GATT obligations and constant pressures in member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to expand the <b>escape</b> <b>clauses</b> to provide protection to politically powerful constituencies - often without much regard for the limits within the GATT - in the other direction. General GATT obligations include Articles I, II, II and XI. Politics dictate the pressures that predominate, but, to ensure that protectionist pressures do not gain excessively, the different <b>escape</b> <b>clauses</b> in the WTO must be narrowly defined. They are justified in various ways. There is little or no coordination or consistency left, however, between the terms under which they are applicable, given all the changes that have taken place with the rapid integration of the world economy since the GATT came into being in 1948...|$|R

A general agreement at the national level determines the wage indexation mechanism that is binding for the entire private sector, while sectoral and enterprise-level agreements negotiate additional wage increases based on productivity growth, financial performance, and other considerations. Agreements at each of the lower levels normally improve on the provisions of the higher level agreements. However, the higher level agreements generally include <b>escape</b> <b>clauses</b> that allow enterprises in financial distress to defer specified wage increases under certain conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Disengagement {{theory was}} {{developed}} by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other.

Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.|$|E

He had long been a business associate of New York Yankees owners Dan Topping, Larry MacPhail and Del Webb, and had even bought Yankee Stadium in 1953, though the league owners forced Johnson to sell the property before acquiring the Athletics. He'd also bought Blues Stadium in Kansas City, home of the Yankees' top Triple AAA level Minor league baseball farm team, the Kansas City Blues of the second [...] American Association. After Johnson got permission from the American League [...] to move the A's from the [...] "City of Brotherly Love" [...] to Kansas City, he sold Blues Stadium to the city, which renamed it Kansas City Municipal Stadium and leased it back to Johnson. The lease gave Johnson a three-year <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> if the team failed to draw one million or more customers per season.

In our model, countries engage in ongoing negotiations, and as a consequence cooperative agreements become unsustainable in the absence of external enforcement institutions. By using mechanisms such as delays in dispute resolution and direct penalties, enforcement institutions can restore incentives for cooperation, despite the lack of any coercive power. The occur- rence of costly trade disputes, and the feasibility of mechanisms such as <b>escape</b> <b>clauses,</b> depend on the adaptability of enforcement institutions in their use of information...|$|R

50|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>clauses</b> {{that require}} a {{purchaser}} or an expert representing the purchaser {{to be satisfied with}} the goods or services being purchased have been attacked in lawsuits as invalid for lack of consideration. The argument is that a party can always escape such a contract by merely claiming to be unsatisfied. Therefore, there is no real requirement for that party to perform their obligations under the contract (to pay for the goods or services), and an agreement that only requires performance by one party is an illusory promise, void as a contract. Instead, such an agreement constitutes a gift from the performing party to the non-performing party.|$|R
