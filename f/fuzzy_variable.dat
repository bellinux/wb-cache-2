5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and statistics, a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable</b> (such as [...] "the temperature", [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold") is a value which could {{lie in a}} probable range defined by quantitative limits or parameters, and which can be usefully described with imprecise categories (such as [...] "high", [...] "medium" [...] or [...] "low") using some kind of qualitative scale.|$|E
30|$|In the future, deep {{research}} is needed {{to take into account the}} case with much more <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> and the case that membership functions of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> are more complicated. Additionally, it should be noted that although the calculation process of the RUBV has been simplified in this paper, the calculations of some <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> are not easy enough even under the help of Matlab.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} manage and use knowledge, ontology technologies are widely applied to {{various kinds of}} domain knowledge. This paper proposes a Chinese term clustering mechanism for generating semantic concepts of a news ontology. We utilize the parallel fuzzy inference mechanism to infer the conceptual resonance strength of a Chinese term pair. There are four input fuzzy variables, consisting of a Part-of-Speech (POS) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable,</b> Term Vocabulary (TV) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable,</b> Term Association (TA) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable,</b> and Common Term Association (CTA) <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable,</b> and one output <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variable,</b> the Conceptual Resonance Strength (CRS), in the mechanism. In addition, the CKIP tool is used in Chinese natural language processing tasks, including POS tagging, refining tagging, and stop word filtering. The fuzzy compatibility relation approach to the semantic concept clustering is also proposed. Simulation results show that our approach can effectively cluster Chinese terms to generate the semantic concepts of a news ontology...|$|E

Although the variance of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> {{with respect to the}} possibility measure and its properties have been studied before, the variance of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> {{on the basis of the}} credibility measure has not been formally investigated yet due to the intricate process of calculation. It is acknowledged that the credibility measure is self-dual, which is important both theoretically and practically.

They also presented the process about the calculation of the variance on linear combination of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables,</b> {{which turned out to}} be figured in an analogous way as in probability theory. Chen and Tan [9] further studied the definitions of variance and covariance in multiplication of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables,</b> which were applied in portfolio to build possibilistic models for better selection under an uncertain situation.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{arranged}} as follows. Section  2 reviews some fundamental notions and theories of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables</b> including the credibility distribution, the inverse credibility distribution, and the expected value. Section  3 presents the calculation process of the accurate variance for <b>fuzzy</b> <b>variables.</b> Section  4 introduces the definition of the RUBV based on an inequality of the variance. Correspondingly, a calculation formula in terms of this RUBV is suggested, together with some examples and comparisons with the accurate values of variance.
