40|$|International audienceBuprenorphine, {{a partial}} mu-receptor agonist widely {{substituted}} for heroin {{in the treatment}} of addiction, is often misused in combination with benzodiazepines. Improved hedonic properties may result, but only at the cost of increased buprenorphine toxicity. In order to elucidate the appeal of the benzodiazepine-buprenorphine combination, the present study looked at its neuropsycho-pharmacological effects on various emotional and cognitive parameters in the mouse. On the basis of previous dose-response studies, the regimen used was buprenorphine 0. 3 mg/kg, s. c. plus <b>dipotassium</b> <b>clorazepate</b> 1, 4 and 16 mg/kg, i. p. Anxiety-like behaviour was assessed using the black and white test box, and memory processes were examined via the spontaneous alternation paradigm in the Y-maze, and passive avoidance tests. Spontaneous locomotor activity was also evaluated. High doses of clorazepate impaired buprenorphine-induced hyperactivity and anxiogenic-like effects. They also increased buprenorphine-induced spontaneous alternation impairment, but did not modify its impact on long-term memory processes. These results suggest that the positive reinforcement experienced with the buprenorphine-benzodiazepine combination may be attributable, at least in part, to an increase in buprenorphine's sedative effect associated with a decrease in anxiogenicity...|$|E
50|$|Diazepam and <b>Clorazepate</b> <b>Dipotassium</b> {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to alleviate cramping in some cases, but have also failed to help in other cases. Scopolamine (Buscopan) rectal suppositories or injections and Gaviscon {{have been used}} to alleviate intestinal symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Clorazepate (marketed {{under the}} brand names Tranxene and Novo-Clopate), {{also known as}} <b>clorazepate</b> <b>dipotassium,</b> is a benzodiazepine. It {{possesses}} anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Clorazepate is a unusually long-lasting benzodiazepine {{and serves as a}} majoritive prodrug for the equally long-lasting desmethyldiazepam, which is rapidly produced as an active metabolite. Desmethyldiazepam is responsible for most of the therapeutic effects of clorazepate.|$|R
40|$|<b>Clorazepate</b> <b>dipotassium</b> was {{administered}} orally for the five-day prophylactic treatment of potential, incipient and overt withdrawal {{signs and symptoms}} in 226 patients on admission to an inpatient alcohol treatment unit. Conservative estimates based on these patients' histories and on literature reports predicted that between 7 and 40 (3 % to 18 %) of these persons {{would be expected to}} have a withdrawal convulsion. No patients experienced convulsions. This complete absence of seizures suggests that clorazepate is effective in counteracting convulsive and other manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome...|$|R
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as <b>clorazepate</b> <b>dipotassium.</b> When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 34 -year-old woman {{presenting}} with an erythema multiforme (EM) -like eruption. Lesions developed after a 12 -day treatment with a slimming drug preparation (food integrator with thermogenic activity) and a herbal remedy (pilosella tincture). Serological investigations excluded viral or bacterial infections. Patch testing with galenic preparations of both drugs demonstrated sensitization to the slimming drug preparation. According to literature reports and immune-chemical properties, those components that are likely to have triggered the skin eruption are <b>clorazepate</b> <b>dipotassium</b> and theobromine. Their interaction with other two constituents such as pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and dehydrocholic acid may have caused the adverse reaction by means of a summation effect. There are no reports specifically about EM caused by a slimming drug preparation and no studies have identified thermogenic pills as cause of EM/EM-like eruption. Weight-loss compounds in slimming preparations should be kept in mind as a possible cause of drug-induced EM-like eruption...|$|R
