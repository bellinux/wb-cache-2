25|$|On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed Apple Computer (now called Apple Inc.) {{along with}} {{administrative}} supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose {{participation in the}} new venture was short lived. Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett-Packard and became the {{vice president in charge}} of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal <b>expansion</b> <b>cards.</b> With <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 microprocessor (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display, all components the user had to provide.|$|E
25|$|Conventional PCI and PCI-X are {{sometimes}} called Parallel PCI {{in order to}} distinguish them technologically from their more recent successor PCI Express, which adopted a serial, lane-based architecture. Conventional PCI's heyday in the desktop computer market was approximately 1995–2005. PCI and PCI-X have become obsolete for most purposes; however, they are still common on modern desktops {{for the purposes of}} backwards compatibility and the low relative cost to produce. Many kinds of devices previously available on PCI <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and PCI Express versions.|$|E

25|$|The FireStream line is {{a series}} of add-on <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> {{released}} from 2006 to 2010, based on standard Radeon GPUs but designed to serve as a general-purpose co-processor, rather than rendering and outputting 3D graphics. Like the FireGL/FirePro line, they were given more memory and memory bandwidth, but the FireStream cards do not necessarily have video output ports. All support 32-bit single-precision floating point, and all but the first release support 64-bit double-precision. The line was partnered with new APIs to provide higher performance than existing OpenGL and Direct3D shader APIs could provide, beginning with Close to Metal, followed by OpenCL and the Stream Computing SDK, and eventually integrated into the APP SDK.|$|E
500|$|Original {{marketing}} {{materials for the}} Mac Pro generally referred to the middle-of-the-line model with 2 × dual-core 2.66GHz processors. Previously, Apple featured the base model with the words [...] "starting at" [...] or [...] "from" [...] when describing the pricing, but the online US Apple Store listed the [...] "Mac Pro at $2499", the price for the mid-range model. The system could be configured at US$2299, much more comparable with the former base-model dual-core G5 at US$1999, although offering considerably more processing power. Post revision, the default configurations for the Mac Pro includes one quad-core Xeon 3500 at 2.66GHz or two quad-core Xeon 5500s at 2.26GHz each. Like its predecessor, the Power Mac G5, the pre-2013 Mac Pro was Apple's only desktop with standard expansion slots for graphics adapters and other <b>expansion</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Components {{such as the}} {{front-mounted}} IrDA {{port and}} the tray-loading CD-ROM drive were borrowed from the Apple laptops. Although the iMac did not officially have an expansion slot, the first versions had a slot dubbed the [...] "mezzanine slot". [...] It was only for internal use by Apple, although a few third-party <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> were released for it, such as a Voodoo II video card upgrade from 3dfx and SCSI/SCSI-TV tuner cards (iProRAID and iProRAID TV) from the German company Formac. The mezzanine slot was removed from later iMacs, though according to {{an article in the}} German computer magazine c't, the socket can be retrofitted on revision C iMacs.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} SPARCstation 1 design {{included an}} expansion bus technology, SBus, expressly {{designed for the}} form factor; <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> were small, especially in comparison to other <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> in use at the time such as VMEbus, and were mounted horizontally instead of vertically. PC&#8209;compatible computers {{in this type of}} case typically use the PCI expansion bus and are usually either a) limited to one or two horizontally placed <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> or b) require special low-profile <b>expansion</b> <b>cards,</b> shorter than the PCI cards regular PCs use.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the form}} factor of the {{motherboard}} and case, around one to seven <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be added to}} a computer system. 19 or more <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> can be installed in backplane systems. When many <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> are added to a system, total power consumption and heat dissipation become limiting factors. Some <b>expansion</b> <b>cards</b> take up more than one slot space. For example, many graphics cards on the market as of 2010 are dual slot graphics cards, using the second slot as a place to put an active heat sink with a fan.|$|E
