40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Portland District has 90 {{spillway}} radial Tainter gates. There are 42 gates at the 11 Willamette Valley Basin projects, 5 gates {{at the two}} Rogue Basin {{projects and}} 43 gates at the two Columbia River projects. Since 2001 there have been various studies, inspections and incidents that have prompted the Portland District to become concerned about the structural integrity and mechanical and electrical reliability of these gates. In 2008, load induced buckling was observed on {{three of the four}} Tainter gate end frames at Foster Dam which led to emergency repairs. Additional observations of buckled Tainter <b>gate</b> <b>strut</b> arms at Dexter Dam in December 2009 required repairs and created urgency with respect to documenting the risk to the downstream population at all District projects. These events led to a comprehensive assessment of the Tainter gates in the Willamette Valley and Rogue Basin projects which was implemented in 2010. The comprehensive assessment included a gates specific potential failure modes analysis (PFMA), structural, mechanical and electrical assessments, identification of interim risk reduction measures (IRRMs), and analysis of impacts of the interim risk reduction measures. As part of this assessment, the District developed a tool for prioritizing projects for gate repair {{based on the results of}} the assessment. Since identifying the issues with Tainter gates, Portland District has implemented IRRMs, taken a systems-based approach to repairs, and implemented a capitalization program to improve gate reliability. Repairs are complete or underway at 36 of the 42 Tainter gates in the Willamette Valley, a study is underway to address reliability of regulating outlets, and future studies are planned for Columbia River spillway gates.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} yoke plate. The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or composite sleeve between the yoke plate and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, yoke plate thickness, and sleeve material have on the trunnion shaft to yoke plate load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the yoke plate thickness by including multiple solution points across the yoke plate thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, sleeve material, yoke plate thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the trunnion pin friction moment demand on the tainter <b>gate</b> <b>strut</b> arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate, the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.
