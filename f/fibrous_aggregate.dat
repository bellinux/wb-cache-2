If iron replaces the magnesium within {{the structure of the}} mineral, it is called ferrorichterite; if fluorine replaces the hydroxyl, it is called fluororichterite. Richterite crystals are long and prismatic, or prismatic to <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate,</b> or rock-bound crystals. Colors of richterite range from brown, grayish-brown, yellow, brownish- to rose-red, or pale to dark green. Richterite occurs in thermally metamorphosed limestones in contact metamorphic zones. It also occurs as a hydrothermal product in mafic igneous rocks, and in manganese-rish ore deposits. Localities include Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, and Wilberforce and Tory Hill, Ontario, Canada; Långban and Pajsberg, Sweden; West Kimberley, Western Australia; Sanka, Myanmar; and, in the US, at Iron Hill, Colorado; Leucite Hills, Wyoming; and Libby, Montana.

To form the self-assembling nanofiber, the nanofiber-forming molecules contain a peptide segment with one domain {{that has a}} strong propensity to form extended β-sheets and the second domain with residues for bioactivity. The β-sheets domain is crucial for promoting assembly of <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate</b> instead of spherical aggregate [60]. By combining synthetic biodegradable polymers, Ramakrishna was able to increase the porosity of polycaprolactone/hyaluronic acid/gelatin to over 93  % and maintain tensile strength to support osteoblast for mineralization [61]. This interconnecting porous composite nanofibrous scaffold provided large surface area for cell attachment, cell activity, and cell proliferation.

40|$|SUMMARY. During the {{transformation}} f manganite to pyrolusite the b-axis must contract about I 5 To. There {{is evidence that}} the shrinkage takes place partly by contraction of the whole crystal, but electron-microscope investigations of natural pyrolusites and of manganite oxidized in the laboratory show that the reaction also involves the formation of lamellar pores about 85 A apart, parallel to (oIo) of the original manganite. Thus, although pyrolusite is tetragonal, the a- and b-axes are not micro-scopically identical, afact which could explain why, when natural pyrolusite is treated hydrothermally at 2 oo and 3 oo ~ and IOOO bars, only one orientation of manganite is formed (Dent Glasser and Smith, I 968). The pores and the accompanying distortion of the structure act as a 'memory ' of the parent phase. Two forms of pyrolusite occur in nature. Rare, well-formed crystals with a hardness greater than quartz are considered to be of primary origin (Strunz, I 943) but most pyrolusites are thought o be pseudomorphous after manganite and sometimes occur intergrown with it (Strunz, I 943; Davis I 967). Pseudomorphic pyrolusite usually occurs as a friable <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate</b> with relict (oIo) cleavage.

This 174 -residue primarily β-sheet protein {{is made up of}} four Greek keys separated into two domains. Mutations in the human gene sequence encoding HγD-Crys are implicated in early-onset cataracts in children, and the mutant protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibits properties that reflect the in vivo pathology. We have characterized the unfolding, refolding, and competing aggregation of human wild-type HγD-Crys as a function of guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) concentration at neutral pH and 37 °C, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to monitor in vitro folding. Wild-type HγD-Crys exhibited reversible refolding above 1. 0 M GuHCl. The GuHCl unfolded protein was more fluorescent than its native counterpart despite the absence of metal or ion-tryptophan interactions. Aggregation of refolding intermediates of HγD-Crys was observed in both equilibrium and kinetic refolding processes. The aggregation pathway competed with productive refolding at denaturant concentrations below 1. 0 M GuHCl, beyond the major conformational transition region. Atomic force microscopy of samples under aggregating conditions revealed the sequential appearance of small nuclei, thin protofibrils, and fiber bundles. The HγD-Crys <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate</b> species bound bisANS appreciably, indicating the presence of exposed hydrophobic pockets.

30|$|The {{melting point}} of Au is 1063 °C while for Si it is 1414 °C. Although for an alloy which {{contains}} 81 % Au and 19 % Si, the {{melting point is}} 359 °C, called the eutectic point. The formation of Au-Si alloy catalyst is explained via a Vapor-Liquid-Solid (VLS) process [6] during the synthesis of Si nanowires. In this experiment, since the laser radiation fluence (0.5 J/cm 2) used is much above the ablation threshold of Au (0.2 J/cm 2) with multiple pulses [26], gold may diffuse into the silicon substrate to form an alloy at the interface [27]. This alloy layer at the interface started melting due to cumulative heating by the subsequent laser pulses. The expulsion of molten alloy material results {{in the formation of}} alloy nanoparticles. Once the alloy layer is depleted further irradiation ablates the underlying silicon substrate and generates the plasma. At this point, the silicon nanoparticles are generated by nucleation and condensation of vapor in the plasma [8] and agglomerates with Au-Si alloy nanoparticles to form weblike nanofibrous structure. Although irradiation of molten alloy nanoparticles by subsequent laser pulses may increase their temperature, it is not supporting the growth of silicon nanowires [27]. The relative proportion of alloy nanoparticles in the aggregate nanostructure is mainly determined by the laser interaction time. This is implicitly understood from the SEM/EDX analysis, which shows the atomic percent of gold and silicon as a function of interaction time in the <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate</b> structure. In contrast to normal VLS process [6], where the source of semiconductor is supplied as vapor phase, in this case both gold and silicon are originated from the gold-coated solid silicon substrate. Upon laser irradiation, molten Au-Si alloy layer is formed and transforms into molten nanoparticles and agglomerates as solid weblike self-assembled fibrous structure. In other words, the fibrous nanoparticles aggregate process can be regarded as Solid-Liquid-Solid [27] process. In this experiment, Si/Au-Si fibrous nanoparticles aggregate is generated in a single step under ambient condition. The existence of Au-Si alloy in the nanoparticles aggregate is corroborated from XRD, TEM/EDX, and XPS analysis. Moreover, the size of alloy nanoparticles calculated from the peaks of XRD diffractogram matches well with the size observed from TEM micrographs.|$|E

Oxidation of Fe(OH) _ 2 ·xH_ 2 O from FeCl_ 2 solution with high Cl^- concentration ([Cl^-]/[Fe]=R_Cl≥ 8) or (NH_ 4) _ 2 Fe(SO_ 4) _ 2 (FAS) with [HPO_ 4 ^ 2 -]/[Fe]=RP ≥ 0. 02 yields phase-pure γ-FeOOH. In the medium ranges of R_Cl and R_P, mixed phases of α-FeOOH and γ-FeOOH are obtained. Replacement of OH^- by Cl^- with the bridging cations or strongly bonded HPO_ 4 ^ 2 - ions in the matrix of the intermediate phase (Fe_x ^ 2 +Fe_y ^ 3 +(OH) _ 2 x+ 2 y - nz· xH_ 2 O(A) _z ^n-, where A is anions such as Cl^-, SO_ 4 ^ 2 -, HPO_ 4 ^ 2 -, etc.), promoted the lower density γ-FeOOH. However, the particles are less developed and have poor crystallinity as evidenced from {{transmission electron microscope}} and thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis of the precipitates. Whereas, monophasic, uniformly sized, nano-lath shaped particles with high aspect ratio > 10 are obtained when morphology-controlling cation additives such as Pt^ 4 +, Pd ^ 2 + or Rh ^ 3 + are present in FeCl_ 2 (R_Cl≥ 8) solution. Preferential adsorption of additives on (0 k 0) and (h 00) planes limits {{the growth in the}} perpendicular directions leading to high aspect ratios. The effect of these additives are suppressed by the phosphate ion, a strong complexing ligand, giving rise to <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregate</b> with the length of individual particles as small as 10 – 30 nm. While most of the Cl^- ion is removed from the final precipitates on washing, phosphate remained as HPO_ 4 ^ 2 - as evidenced from IR absorption spectra. Maghemite obtained by dehydroxylating γ-FeOOH contains randomly distributed micropores bringing in the relaxation effects of spins on the surface atoms as deciphered from Mössbauer spectroscopy. This leads to the low σ_s (44 – 48 emu/g) and H_c (120 – 130 Oe) for γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 - δ particles. Whereas nearly pore-free single crystalline particles obtained by reduction followed by reoxidation has high value of σ_s (73 emu/g) and H_c (320 Oe), which decreases to 30 emu/g and 75 Oe, respectively, for nanoparticles obtained from phosphate stabilized lepidocrocite.

We have developed recently a rapid assay for monitoring PHF assembly and show here that PHFs arise from a nucleated assembly mechanism. The PHF nucleus comprises about 8 – 14 tau monomers. A prerequisite for nucleation is the dimerization of tau because tau dimers act as effective building blocks. PHF assembly can be seeded by preformed filaments (made either in vitro or isolated from Alzheimer brain tissue).

Peptides encompassing two alpha-helical domains of PrP when mixed with PrPC produced a complex that displayed many properties of PrPSc.

All fibrils reveal structural polymorphism; the “thin twisted” and “thin smooth” fibrils resemble flat ribbons (cross-section ∼ 10 × 15 nm) with diverse twist periodicities. “Thick fibrils” show periodicities of ∼ 65 – 70 nm and thicknesses of ∼ 9 – 18 nm such as routinely reported for “paired helical filaments” but structurally resemble heavily twisted ribbons. Therefore, thin and thick fibrils assembled from different human Tau isoforms challenge current structural models of paired helical filaments. Furthermore, all Tau fibrils reveal axial subperiodicities of ∼ 17 – 19 nm and, upon exposure to mechanical stress or hydrophobic surfaces, disassemble into uniform fragments that remain connected by thin thread-like structures (∼ 2 nm). This hydrophobically induced disassembly is inhibited at enhanced electrolyte concentrations, {{indicating that the}} fragments resemble structural building blocks and the fibril integrity depends largely on hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Because full-length Tau and repeat domain constructs assemble into fibrils of similar thickness, the “fuzzy coat” of Tau protein termini surrounding the fibril axis is nearly invisible for atomic force microscopy and EM, presumably because of its high flexibility...|$|R
40|$|The apoptosis-associated speck-like protein {{containing}} a caspase recruit domain (ASC) {{is involved in}} apoptosis and innate immunity and is a major adaptor molecule responsible for procaspase- 1 activation. ASC mRNA is encoded by three exons: exons 1 and 3 encode a pyrin domain (PYD) and caspase recruit domain (CARD), respectively, and exon 2 encodes a proline and glycine-rich (PGR) domain. Here, we identified a variant ASC protein (vASC) lacking the PGR domain that was smaller than full length ASC (fASC) derived from fully transcribed mRNA and searched for differences in biochemical and biological nature. Both fASC and vASC were found to activate procaspase- 1 to a similar degree, but the efficiency of IL- 1 β excretion was significantly higher for vASC. There was also a marked structural difference observed in the <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregates</b> formed by fASC and vASC. These results suggest that although the PGR domain is dispensable for procaspase- 1 activation, it {{plays an important role}} in the regulation of the molecular structure and activity of ASC.

40|$|Fish gelatin (FG) is more {{suitable}} for consumption by religious people than mammalian gelatin. One common modification method of FG is mixing FG with polysaccharides. However, the mechanism is not clear. We found that FG gel containing 0. 1 g/ 100 mL gellan, 20 mmol/L CaCl 2 and 6. 67 g/ 100 mL FG (180 Bloom) matched gel strength, hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness as well as gelling temperature (T-g) and melting temperature (T-m) of commercial beef gelatin (BG) (240 Bloom). The modified FG was also observed by the result of helix/coil ratio and spherical aggregates. The modification decreased the diameter of FG 2 ̆ 7 s aggregates from 472 to 249 nm, which matched with BG (272 nm, P < 0. 05). Coexistence of segregative gellan-gellan <b>fibrous</b> <b>aggregates</b> and associated FG-gellan amorphous structure were also identified at the modified FG by atomic force microscope (AFM). The helix/coil ratio and diameter of spherical aggregates were inversely correlated, the mechanism behind was the strength of gelatin association. The involvement of hydrogen bond and presence of FG-gellan complex have been validated by urea addition and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A schematic model was proposed. As modified FG successfully matched the of texture properties of BG, {{it is promising to}} replace BG with FG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
