500|$|Even {{to the end}} of his life, Speer {{continued}} to question his actions under Hitler.

How far would <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone?...</b> If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?" [...] Speer leaves the questions unanswered.|$|E

500|$|Akbar's son, Emperor Jahangir, also {{continued}} {{the practice of}} Jharokha Darshan. In Agra Fort, the jharokha window {{is part of the}} structure which represents the Shah Burj, the Royal Tower. The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion. During Jahangir's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan. During Jahangir's Jharokha Darshan, hanging a string to tie petitions, was also practiced. This was also a Persian system under naushrwan. Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it. Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas. Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and {{made it a point to}} conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick; he had said [...] "even in the time of weakness <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> every day to the jharokha, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed custom." ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 1980 Hodgson {{asked to}} see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed {{that he was having}} nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed [...] "kept coming back to him". He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done".|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E

500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|In 1863–1864 {{during the}} American Civil War, Edward {{traveled}} through Europe, taking {{the opportunity to}} visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father {{later on in the}} war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests [...] Edward's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman (whom he at one point intended to marry) broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, [...] "I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Europe to avoid the war." [...] Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom.|$|E
500|$|Following his San Francisco sojourn, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore {{and participated in}} Waters's next film Pink Flamingos. Designed by Waters to be [...] "an exercise in poor taste," [...] the film featured Divine as Babs Johnson, a woman who claims to be [...] "the filthiest person alive" [...] and who is forced to prove her right to the title from challengers, Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary). In one scene, the Marbles send Babs a turd in a box as a birthday present, {{and in order to}} enact this scene, Divine defecated into the box the night before. Filmed in a hippie commune in Phoenix, Maryland, the cast members spent much of the time smoking cigarettes and marijuana and taking amphetamines, although all of the scenes had been heavily rehearsed beforehand. The final scene in the film proved particularly infamous, involving Babs eating fresh dog feces; Divine later told a reporter, [...] "I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole," [...] waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. The scene {{became one of the most}} notable moments of Divine's acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that [...] "I run around doing it all the time. I've received boxes of dog shit– plastic dog shit. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it's what I want to talk about." [...] In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because it was in the script.|$|E

It is currently unknown as to whether the Steve Riley-led version of the band will continue following Phil Lewis' departure.|$|E

2500|$|During Ramakrishna's last days, {{during which}} he {{suffered}} from throat cancer, Sarada Devi {{played an important role}} in nursing him and preparing suitable food for him and his disciples. It is reported that after Ramakrishna's death in August 1886, when Sarada Devi tried to remove her bracelets as the customs dictated for a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna in which he said, [...] "I have not passed away, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from one room to another." [...] According to her, whenever she thought of dressing like a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna asking her not to do so. After Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi continued to play an important role in the nascent religious movement. She remained the spiritual guide of the movement for the next 34 years.|$|E
2500|$|Author Isaac Asimov {{recounted in}} his second autobiographical volume In Joy Still Felt seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954, during which he sang very cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, [...] "and {{after a while you}} {{gathered}} the 'it' to be venereal disease [...] Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every perversion known to mankind without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." [...] Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. [...] "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," [...] said Asimov, [...] "but of all the times <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone,</b> it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time." ...|$|E
