40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{examine the}} impact of {{residual}} pain on functional outcomes two years after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and compare the types of graft used during the procedure (patellar vs. flexor). Method: A retrospective epidemiological study on 129 ACL reconstructions with a mean follow-up of 28 months was conducted. The presence, intensity and location of the anterior pain were investigated. Pain provocation tests were conducted, sensitivity was analyzed and functional scores were applied (IKDC, femoropatellar and SF- 36), comparing the results with the type of graft used. Results: Anterior pain was present in 28 % of patients with a mean intensity of 2. 9 in 10. When pain was present, the functional scores decreased significantly. Abnormalities of <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and gait occurred frequently with use of the patellar tendon, but there was no statistical difference regarding the presence of pain. Conclusion: The presence of anterior pain in ACL reconstructions, even if minimal, has a deleterious effect on the final outcome over the medium term.

40|$|Rupture of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) is a com-mon injury and intra-articular ACL reconstruction using autologous materials is widely used. The results are reported as good and reproducible in several studies using different autologous grafts harvested from around the knee region. 4, 5, 9, 10, 22 The use of the central third of the patellar tendon with bone blocks at either end (bone–patellar tendon–bone, or BTB) as an autograft for arthroscopic reconstruction of the ruptured ligament has become a stan-dard procedure during the past decade, sometimes even called the “gold standard. ” 21, 23 However, well-known prob-lems {{have been reported in}} conjunction with this method, especially in terms of donor-site morbidity, such as anterior knee pain, disturbances in <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and kneeling dis-comfort. 18, 31, 34, 39, 48 It has been suggested that by obtainin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse factors {{affecting}} donor site morbidity after arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autografts from the central-third of the patellar tendon. A follow-up study was performed two to five years after the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction on 604 patients. Patients with full range of motion and preserved sensitivity in the anterior region of the reconstructed knee had significantly less anterior knee pain and fewer problems kneeling and knee-walking than patients with loss of motion and/or sensitivity. A dissection study of 60 cadaver or amputated lower extremities revealed that it was possible to harvest consistent bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts through two vertical 25 mm incisions, leaving the infrapatellar nerve(s) undamaged and the paratenon partially intact in the majority of the specimens. Thirty-five patients, in whom the patellar tendon was harvested using the traditional one-incision technique, and 37 patients, in whom the patellar tendon was harvested using the subcutaneous two-incision technique, were compared. Assessments two years after the index operation revealed that the subcutaneous technique produced less disturbance in anterior <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and a smaller donor site gap, i. e. the area corresponding to non-tendinous-like tissue signal, as seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Serial magnetic resonance imagings performed on 37 patients, six weeks, six months and 27 months after harvesting the central-third of the patellar tendon using the subcutaneous technique revealed that the donor site gap decreased with time. Furthermore, it was shown that the thickness and width of the patellar tendon at the donor site increased compared with the contralateral patellar tendon, regardless of the time that had elapsed since the harvesting procedure. Ultrasonography-guided biopsies were obtained from the donor site area in 19 patients. Histological evaluation revealed tendon-like tissue in the central and the peripheral part of the patellar tendon, 27 months after harvesting its central-third. The repair tissue in the central part showed increased cellularity and vascularity, as compared with both the peripheral part of the harvested patellar tendon and control tissue from normal tendons. Increased cellularity and vascularity were also found in the peripheral part as compared with normal control tissue. Glycosaminoglycans and collagen type III were undetectable in the biopsies from the donor site patellar tendon. In conclusion, disturbance in full range of motion and disturbance in anterior <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity</b> after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using central-third patellar tendon autografts was correlated with subjective anterior knee pain and discomfort during kneeling and knee-walking. The subcutaneous two-incision graft harvesting technique produced less disturbance in anterior <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and smaller persisting donor site gaps than the traditional one-incision technique. The donor site gap was gradually filled with tendinous-like repair tissue, as seen on the serial magnetic resonance imagings and this was confirmed by histological evaluations 27 months after the harvesting procedure. However, the tissue in the central and the peripheral parts of the patellar tendon at the donor site displayed a significant increase in cellularity and vascularity, as compared with control tissue from normal tendons...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Analisar o impacto que a dor {{residual}} traz aos resultados funcionais após dois anos da reconstrução artroscópica do LCA e comparando o tipo de enxerto utilizado durante o procedimento (patelar x flexores). MÉTODO: Realizou-se estudo epidemiológico, retrospectivo, incluindo as 129 reconstruções do LCA, com acompanhamento médio de 28 meses. Foi procurada a presença, a intensidade e a localização da dor anterior. Foram realizados testes provocadores de dor, estudo da sensibilidade e aplicados escores funcionais (IKDC, femoropatelar e SF- 36), comparando os resultados com o tipo de enxerto utilizado. RESULTADOS: A dor anterior esteve presente em 28 % dos pacientes com uma intensidade média de 2, 9 em 10. A dor quando presente fez os escores funcionais baixarem de forma significativa. Alterações de sensibilidade e na marcha sobre os joelhos foram frequentes com uso do tendão patelar; assim, porém, não houve diferença estatística quanto à presença da dor. CONCLUSÃO: A presença de dor anterior, mesmo que mínima nas reconstruções ligamentares do LCA, tem um efeito deletério no resultado final em médio prazo. Devido à influência da coleta do enxerto na presença de alterações da sensibilidade e marcha sobre os joelhos, a escolha do mesmo deve levar em conta a atividade profissional e esportiva do paciente.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the sensitivity, specificity, {{positive and negative}} predictive value of contrast-enhanced (gadolinium) magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRA) and colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) of lower limb arteries. DesignProspective, single centre study. Material and methodsA consecutive series of 58 patients with intermittent claudication (IC) were examined with CE-MRA and CDU from the infrarenal aorta to the tibio-peroneal trunk with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as reference. The arterial tree was divided into 15 segments, pooled into three regions; suprainguinal, thigh and <b>knee.</b> <b>Sensitivity,</b> specificity, positive and negative predictive values for significant obstructions were calculated. Cohen Kappa statistics was used to establish agreement between the three methods. ResultsThe sensitivity (specificity in parentheses) for significant obstructions in the suprainguinal region were 96 % (94 %) for CE-MRA and 91 % (96 %) for CDU, in the thigh region 92 % (95 %) for CE-MRA and 76 % (99 %) for CDU, and in the knee region 93 % (96 %) for CE-MRA and 33 % (98 %) for CDU. CDU failed to visualize 10 % of suprainguinal, 2 % of thigh and 13 % of knee-region arterial segments. ConclusionsBoth CE-MRA and CDU are good alternatives to DSA in the suprainguinal- and thigh-region. In the knee region only CE-MRA can be relied upon {{as an alternative to}} DSA.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{develop a}} {{sensitive}} and specific screening tool for knee and hip osteoarthritis {{in the general}} population of elderly people. Methods The Knee and Hip OsteoArthritis Screening Questionnaire (KHOA-SQ) was developed based on previous studies and observed data and sent to 11, 002 people aged 60 to 90 years, stratified by age and gender, who were selected by random sampling. Algorithms of the KHOA-SQ were created. Respondents positive for knee or hip OA on the KHOA-SQ were invited to be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon. A sample of 300 individuals negative for knee or hip OA on the KHOA-SQ were also invited for evaluation. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for the KHOA-SQ, as well as for KHOA-SQ questions. Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to find alternative screening algorithms from the questionnaire. Results Of 11, 002 individuals contacted, 7, 577 completed the KHOA-SQ. Of 1, 115 positive for knee OA, on the KHOA-SQ, 710 (63. 6 %) were diagnosed with it. For hip OA, 339 of the 772 who screened positive (43. 9 %) were diagnosed it. Sensitivity for the hip algorithm was 87. 4 % and specificity 59. 8 %; for the <b>knee,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was 94. 5 % and specificity 43. 8 %.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether a saline load test combined with direct compression to the <b>knee</b> increases <b>sensitivity</b> {{for the assessment of}} traumatic arthrotomy of the knee. Methods: A total of 40 patients scheduled for elective inpatient knee arthroscopy and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were prospectively enrolled. A 7 to 8 ml stab wound for arthrotomy was performed at the inferolateral site of the knee for cases who would receive arthroscopy and at the inferomedial site for the TKA cases. Then, 50 ml of normal saline was injected into the knee joint while observing fluid leakage from the arthrotomy site. It was considered a positive saline load test if there was any leakage. If not, subsequent direct compression was applied to the knee. Any leakage incurred was considered a positive compression test. Results: The saline load test was positive in 13 out of 40 patients and additional 18 patients showed a positive compression test. The sensitivity of the saline load test was 32. 5 % while that of the compression test was 77. 5 %.

40|$|Traumatic arthrotomies may {{predispose}} {{patients to}} subsequent septic arthritis and therefore {{are regarded as}} serious injuries requiring emergent treatment. The saline arthrogram is a commonly used test {{to determine if a}} patient has a traumatic arthrotomy. We determined the sensitivity of the saline arthrogram to identify known intraarticular wounds in 78 patients (80 knees) undergoing elective arthroscopic procedures. There were 66 infrapatellar and 14 suprapatellar incisions. The average length of the incision was 7. 5  mm. Intraarticular position was confirmed with a blunt probe. A saline arthrogram then was performed using 60  mL normal saline. The known arthrotomy (operative wound) was observed during the injection for evidence of saline leakage (positive static test). If no leakage was observed, the knee was brought through a range of motion with continued observation for leakage from the arthrotomy (positive dynamic test). Twenty-two of 80 knees had a positive test without passive range of motion of the <b>knee</b> (static <b>sensitivity,</b> 36 %). Eight additional knees had a positive test with subsequent passive motion (dynamic sensitivity, 43 %).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to reduce {{undesired}} postoperative effects, such as anterior knee pain, loss of sensitivity in the knee region and problems with knee-walking after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery. Furthermore, prospectively to evaluate the bone mineral in the calcanei before and after ACL reconstruction. In a study of 124 consecutive patients we compared the traditional one-incision technique and the subcutaneous two-incision technique to harvest the central third bone-patellar tendon bone (BTB) autograft. The subcutaneous two-incision technique rendered less disturbance in anterior <b>knee</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and a tendency towards less discomfort during knee-walking. In a prospective randomised study of 53 patients we evaluated the effect of preconditioning the BTB autograft with 39 N for ten minutes before implantation. The preconditioning rendered no advantages in terms of less laxity or better clinical outcome at the 2 -year follow-up. Thirty-four consecutive patients with a unilateral ACL injury underwent arthroscopic reconstruction using BTB autografts. The bone mineral areal mass (BMA) was assessed bilaterally in the calcaneus using a g-camera according to the Dual-energy Photon Absorptiometry technique. The BMA was measured before the operation, after six and 26 months. The BMA in the calcaneus on both the injured and non-injured side decreased by 16 % and 17 % respectively from the preoperative measurement to the 26 -month control. The Tegner activity level, though, increased from 3 preoperatively to 7 at 26 months. In a retrospective study we compared the outcome after ACL reconstruction in 49 recreational athletes with 226 competitive athletes with a minimum follow-up of two years. The functional and objective results were similar. In a prospective randomised study of seventy-one patients we compared the results after ACL reconstruction using either the central third BTB autograft or triple/quadruple semitendinosus autografts. At the two-year follow-up, the use of semitendinosus autografts rendered less discomfort during knee-walking, otherwise the subjective and objective results were similar. In conclusion, when the BTB autograft is used for ACL reconstruction, the donor-site morbidity in terms of loss of sensitivity and impaired knee walking ability can be reduced with a two incision subcutaneous harvesting technique. Preconditioning of BTB autografts does not decrease laxity or improve function in the perspective of two years. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using BTB autografts renders similar results irrespective of the preoperative activity level. ACL injury followed by reconstructive surgery causes a substantial loss of bone mineral in the calcaneus in the perspective of two years, in spite of a signifcantly increased activity level. This was found on both the injured and non-injured side and could be a risk factor for osteoporosis later in life. The use of triple/quadruple semitendinosus autografts renders a better knee walking ability than the use of BTB autografts. Both grafts render equal results in terms of stability and function. We therefore recommend the semitendinosus autograft as a first choice of graft when ACL reconstructive surgery is required...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether technetium bone scintigraphy (BS) {{is useful for}} screening of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the knee (ONK), which was a major affected site, secondary to the femoral head, among multiple osteonecrosis, in patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH).  METHODS—A total of 214  knee joints in 107  patients with ONFH were evaluated by BS and a comparison made with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). ONK was classified into five sites, including the femoral condyles (ONFC), distal femoral metaphysis (ONFM), tibial plateau (ONTP), proximal tibial metaphysis (ONTM), and patella (ONP).  RESULTS—Based on the diagnosis by MRI, ONK was detected in 103  knees of 62  patients (48 %). ONFC was most common (86  knees, 40 %), ONFM (15 %), followed by ONTM (10 %), ONP (3 %), and ONTP (0. 9 %). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of BS for ONFC detection were 63 %, 71 %, and 68 %, respectively. When the ONFC lesions on the coronal views of MRI were large or medium sized and occupied two thirds, or the entire anteroposterior joint surface on the sagittal views, the sensitivity of BS for ONFC detection increased to 89 % (34 / 38 <b>knees).</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> of BS for ONFM, ONTM, and ONP detection was 3 %, 0 %, and 0 %, respectively, but these lesions showed a low likelihood of collapse.  CONCLUSION—BS is useful for screening large ONK in patients with ONFH given that 89 % of patients with ONFC who had {{a high risk of}} collapse of the knee were identified. ...|$|R

Objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate whether the sensitivity to detect progression of radiographic features, which may add to this identification, can be improved by quantitative measurement (using Knee Images Digital Analysis; KIDA), compared to qualitative grading (according to the Altman atlas). Among individuals with early signs related to osteoarthritis (Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee, Check) symptomatic knees (n= 1082) were selected. Standardized baseline and two-year follow-up radiographs were evaluated for joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and bone density changes using KIDA measurement and Altman scales. Sensitivity to change was determined by calculating the standardized response mean (SRM). For all distinct KIDA parameters, the smallest detectable difference was calculated to define radiographic changes at the individual level. The percentage of knees that changed was compared between KIDA measurement and Altman grading. Also agreement between both methods was evaluated. Studying radiographic progression in knees with early signs related to osteoarthritis showed, for all KIDA and Altman parameters, a small SRM and radiographic change in a small percentage of <b>knees.</b> The <b>sensitivity</b> to detect radiographic progression was similar for KIDA measurement and Altman grading. However, agreement between the Altman and KIDA method was limited (kappa ≤ 0. 20).

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effect of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) in comparison to corticosteroids (CS) for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The data sources included PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and hand searched reviews. Randomized controlled trials that reported the effects of intra-articular HA and CS in the treatment of knee OA were selected based on specific inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was performed for the visual analog scale (VAS), Lequesne index, Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KSS), maximum flexion and adverse events of <b>knee</b> OA. <b>Sensitivity</b> analysis was also conducted to avoid bias. The seven eligible trials included 583 participants and the majority of the trials were of high quality. After one month, the mean difference in the VAS was 1. 66 [95 % confidence interval (CI); ‑ 0. 90, 4. 23), indicating equal efficacy for HA and CS. However, after three months, the mean difference was- 12. 58 (95 % CI;- 17. 76,- 7. 40), while after six months, the difference was- 9. 01 (95 % CI;- 12. 62,- 5. 40), favoring HA. For the additional indicators, including the Lequesne index, the KSS, maximum flexion and adverse events, no statisti-cally significant differences were observed between the two treatment approaches for knee OA. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis highlight a therapeutic trajectory for intra-articular HA in knee OA pain, as compared with CS, over six months post-intervention. After one month, the two approaches exhibited equal efficacy; however, in the long term, HA was found to have an enhanced effect. No statisti-cally significant difference was observed in the adverse events caused by the two interventions. Further investigation and understanding into the trend observed in the present study may aid clinicians in the treatment of knee OA...|$|R
40|$|<b>Knee</b> joint-position <b>sensitivity</b> {{has been}} shown to decline with {{increasing}} age, with much of the research reported in the literature investigating this age effect in non-weight-bearing (NWB) conditions. However, little data is available in the more functional position of weight-bearing conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the influence of age on the accuracy and nature of knee joint-position sense (JPS) in both full weight-bearing (FWB) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) conditions and to determine the effect of lower-extremity dominance on knee JPS. Sixty healthy subjects from three age groups (young: 20 - 35 years old, middle-aged: 40 - 55 years, and older: 60 - 75 years) were assessed. Tests were conducted on both the right and left legs to examine the ability of subjects to correctly reproduce knee angles in an active criterion-active repositioning paradigm. Knee angles were measured in degrees using an electromagnetic tracking device, Polhemus 3 Space Fastrak, that detected positions of sensors placed on the test limb. Errors in FWB knee joint repositioning did not increase with age, but significant age-related increases in knee joint-repositioning error were found in PWB. It was found that elderly subjects tended to overshoot the criterion angle more often than subjects from the young and middle-aged groups. Subjects in all three age groups performed better in FWB than in PWB. Differences between the stance-dominant (STD) and skill-dominant (SKD) legs did not reach significance. Results demonstrated that for, normal pain-free individuals, there is no age-related decline in knee JPS in FWB, although an age effect does exist in PWB. This outcome challenges the current view that a generalised decline in knee joint proprioception occurs with age. In addition, lower-limb dominance is not a factor in acuity of knee JPS...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} functional balance {{abilities of}} older adults with diabetes, and identify determinants of these abilities. Eighty diabetic and 67 healthy non-diabetic community-dwelling older adults completed the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and questionnaires about their medical and fall histories. Participants were also assessed for vision, plantar sensitivity, muscle strength, and functional balance, including Functional Reach (FR), Five Times Sit-to-Stand (FTSTS), and 180 ° turn (TURN). In addition to between-group comparisons, hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent determinants {{for each of the}} individual balance tasks for the diabetes and control group separately. The diabetes group had significantly greater body mass index, higher rate of cardiac disease, and poorer plantar sensitivity, mental status, grip and lower limb strength. The diabetes group performed significantly poorer in FTSTS and TURN (both p< 0. 001), but not FR (p = 0. 108). The significant determinants for the balance tasks varied substantially between tasks and groups. For the diabetes group, they included visual and plantar sensitivity and MMSE for FR (R 2 = 0. 39), ankle dorsiflexion strength for FTSTS (R 2 = 0. 377), and plantar <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>knee</b> extension strength and MMSE for TURN (R 2 = 0. 391). For the control group, knee extension strength emerged as the common and only significant determinant and only explained approximately 10 % of the variance for FR and TURN. Impairments in functional balance abilities were evident for older adults with diabetes. Their underpinning functional limitations were different for different tasks and were also {{different from those of the}} control group. Screening of functional balance and mental status, lower limb strength and sensory function, and interventions to address these impairments may be important to maintain function, independence and safety for older clients with diabetes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: PFA- 100 © {{is useful}} for {{monitoring}} various congenital and acquired platelet dysfunctions, {{and the effect of}} aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However the lack of clinical outcome correlation remains the weakness of this monitor. We previously showed arthroplasty patients taking NSAIDs preoperatively have a wide range of PFA- 100 ©closure times(Ng KFJ et al., 2008) but the different closure times does not seem to correlate with intraoperative blood loss(Ng KFJ et al., 2007). This study aims to correlate different preoperative PFA- 100 © closure times in these patients with postoperative blood loss as measured by drain output, and thus provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its clinical relevance in surgical patients. METHODS: With IRB approval, we recruited patients taking NSAID and undergoing total knee arthroplasty. All patients were allowed to continue the NSAID up to the time of surgery. No LMWH was used. Preoperative blood was taken for PFA- 100 © ADP and epinephrine closure times (ADPCT and EPICT) measurement immediately before surgery. In some patients, the PFA- 100 ©measurement was repeated with the blood sample haemodiluted by 20 % with saline in vitro. Non-closures were assigned ADPCT or EPICT values of 300 s. In addition, preoperative platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen concentrations (FIB) were measured. Surgery was performed by the same group of surgeons in a standardised manner under general anaesthesia. No deliberate hypotension was performed and body temperature was maintained. Before skin closure one drain under low suction was placed. Postoperative output in the drain and surgeon assessment of ease of haemostasis were the outcome measures. Linear correlation was sought between ADPCT and EPICT and these outcome measures. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 30 patients were recruited (age, 66. 3 ± 8. 6; BMI, 27. 4 ± 5. 3; M/F, 7 / 23), representing 51 knee arthroplasties. Mean ADPCT was 120 ± 60 s and EPICT was 199 ± 79. 6 s. There was significant correlation between EPICT, but not ADPCT and drain output in the ward (r = 0. 30; P = 0. 03). The correlation becomes stronger in the haemodiluted sample (r = 0. 42; P = 0. 01). ADPCT also become correlated with drain output in the haemodiluted sample (r = 0. 41; P = 0. 02). There was no correlation between platelet count, PT, aPTT, FIB or surgeon assessment and drain output. CONCLUSIONS: Although previously found not to predict intraoperative blood loss, the EPICT of the PFA- 100 © predicts postoperative drain output in patients taking NSAIDs and undergoing total <b>knee</b> arthrosplasty. The <b>sensitivity</b> of the prediction seems to improve with in vitro haemodilution of the sample before measurement, which probably reflects the clinical postoperative condition better. The lack of proven clinical relevance of the PFA- 100 © has been a major limitation of this monitor. PFA- 100 ©closure times has never been correlated with blood loss during surgery, except in open heart surgery 3. This study provides the first evidence that the PFA- 100 © can actually predict bleeding perioperatively in general surgical patients. It is a useful monitor of platelet function in patients taking NSAIDs presenting for non-cardiac surgery.
