40|$|Abstract In a {{wireless}} sensor network used as a social infrastructure, priority control is essential to prefer trans-mission of urgent information over other non-urgent information. In our previous report, we proposed UMIUSI (aUtonomous Mechanisms Integrated for Urgent Sensor Information) architecture, in which several simple mecha-nisms are combined to enable autonomous and distributed traffic control while adapting to the scale of an emergency. In this paper, we conducted practical experiments in two testbeds with off-the-shelf sensor nodes onto which we im-plemented UMIUSI, and evaluated the delay and loss rate of urgent information. The results showed that UMIUSI improved the reliability and latency of transmission of urgent information regardless of the scale of an <b>emergency.</b> <b>Key</b> words sensor networks, urgent information, fastness, reliability...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{communication}} {{is central to}} informed decision-making. Guidelines exist to help programs and providers present risk information clearly and effectively. People under stress typically {{want to know that}} you care before they care about what you know. People under stress typically have difficulty hearing, understanding, and remembering information. Background on Topic Risk {{communication is}} the two-way exchange of information about threats, including health threats such as avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and HIV/AIDS. The goals of risk communication are to enhance knowledge and understanding, build trust and credibility, encourage dialogue, and influence attitudes, decisions, and behaviors. These goals apply to all four major types of risk communication: 1) information and education; 2) behavior change and protective action; 3) disaster warning and emergency notification; and 4) joint problem-solving and conflict resolution. To communicate risks effectively, programs should prepare a written communication plan in advance. Deciding ahead of time about many of the necessary communication decisions and activities allows for a quick and effective response during an <b>emergency.</b> <b>Key</b> elements include answering questions such as: What needs to be done?

40|$|Urban {{climate change}} phenomena, {{exacerbated}} by increasingly frequent heat waves, represent an urgent environmental research {{issue to be}} further investigated and counteracted through multidisciplinary approaches covering both engineering and socio-environmental sciences. After acknowledging that Urban Heat Island hugely affects building thermal-energy behavior, recent contributions deal with its effect on vulnerable population groups {{in terms of their}} exposure risk to health diseases even worsened by energy poverty. In this view, the paper investigates the role played by occupants’ education and their knowledge of environmental risks and climate change-related events, by exploring the opportunity to improve their information level as trigger for improving their climate change behavioral resilience and reducing their health risk in the built environment during extreme events. To this aim, a novel widespread questionnaire was elaborated and submitted to more than 300 individuals with varying their educational background and personal characteristics, seasonal period, submission mode, temporal closeness to heat wave <b>emergency.</b> <b>Key</b> findings showed that participants’ educational background represents a clear way to drive environmentally aware behaviors minimizing the consequent health risk imputable to urban overheating and other environmental hazards such as heat waves. In fact, a higher level of awareness and consciousness may lead to a better adaptation capability to such climate change related hazards since they tend to implement conscious and resilient behavioral attitudes to minimize their indoor thermal stress at home (0. 8 versus 1. 4 points awareness level about mitigation strategies). Therefore, this paper demonstrated that informative campaigns may represent an effective strategy for making building occupants more resilient to climate change toward dedicated environmental management solutions and policies taking advantage of educational vehicles...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{develops}} {{the concept of}} epistemological alignment {{as a means of}} understanding how the medical emergency entered into biomedical classification. The working hypothesis is that the medical emergency could not develop as a paradigm from which knowledge could proliferate until a series of related concepts had been elucidated, and its epistemology became aligned. This argument is advanced by exploring the historically constructed lexicon of the medical <b>emergency’s</b> <b>key</b> components. In the process, a semantic network created by 18 th-century attempts to problematize sudden death is elucidated and explored. The paper concludes by arguing that the First World War served as a catalyst for the alignment of concepts central to the epistemology of the medical emergency...|$|R

Com-mon causes in the ICU setting include sepsis, severe hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, and adre-nal insufficiency. Administration of excessive exog-enous insulin is another common cause. Parenteral nutrition formulas contain {{a high concentration of}} dextrose, which stimulates high insulin levels. Abruptly stopping infusions of such formulas can therefore induce hypoglycemia. Uncommon causes include pancreatic islet-cell tumors, various nonpancreatic neoplasms (eg, hepatoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and carcinoid tumors) that secrete insulin-like factors, hereditary fructose in-tolerance, and glycogen storage disease. Certain drugs, (eg, ethanol, sulfonylurea agents, β-adren-ergic blocking agents, pentamidine, quinidine, and disopyramide) can potentially cause hypo-glycemia. The classic diagnostic criteria for hypoglyce-mia are exemplified by Whipple’s triad, which con-sists of hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration < 50 mg/dL) accompanied by classic symptoms of hypoglycemia, with resolution of these symptoms after administration of dextrose. The clinical find-ings of hypoglycemia are mainly either manifes-tations of the resulting hyperadrenergic state or the effects of neuroglycopenia. The latter includ...|$|R

The aim of the present study was to compare the per-formance in cardiopulmonary resuscitation of medical students {{at the time of their}} graduation with that of experienced general practitioners. Methods: 24 teams consisting of three medical students and 24 teams consisting of three general practitioners were confronted with a scenario of a simulated witnessed cardiac arrest. Analysis was performed post-hoc using video recordings ob-tained during the simulation. Results: Medical students diagnosed the car-diac arrest as quickly as general practitioners. Medical students were less likely to call for help in the initial phase of the cardiac arrest (14 / 24 vs 21 / 24; P = 0. 002); had less hands-on time during the first 180 seconds of the arrest (52 ± 33 sec vs 105 ± 39 sec; P < 0. 0001); delayed the first defibril-lation (168 ± 78 vs 116 ± 46 sec, P < 0. 007); and showed less directive leadership (4 / 24 vs 14 / 24 teams, P < 0. 007). The technical quality of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation provided by medical stu-dents was partly better, but for no parameter worse, than that provided by general practitioners. Conclusions: When confronted with a cardiac arrest, medical students at the time of their gradu-ation substantially delayed evidence-based life-saving measures like defibrillation and provided only half of the resuscitation support provided by experienced general practitioners. Future research should focus on how to best prepare medical stu-dents to handle medical <b>emergencies.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); education; manikin; patient simulator; human factors; controlled trial; medical students; general practitioners Partly supported by a grant of the Swiss Nationa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Group {{elevator}} scheduling {{has long}} been recognized as an important problem for building transportation efficiency, since unsatisfactory elevator service {{is one of the}} major complaints of building tenants. It now has a new significance driven by homeland security concerns. The problem, however, is difficult because of complicated elevator dynamics, uncertain traffic in various patterns, and the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization. With the advent of technologies, one important trend is to use advance information collected from devices such as destination entry, radio frequency identification, and sensor networks to reduce uncertainties and improve efficiency. How to effectively utilize such information remains an open and challenging issue. This paper presents the optimized scheduling of a group of elevators with destination entry and future traffic information for normal operations and coordinated <b>emergency</b> evacuation. <b>Key</b> proble...|$|R
