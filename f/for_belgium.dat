5|$|Following the World Cup, Belgium {{embarked}} on their qualification campaign for Euro 2016.

5|$|However, {{despite its}} Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>Belgium,</b> with Syldavian King Muskar XII {{physically}} resembling King Leopold III of Belgium. Hergé's decision {{to create a}} fictional East European kingdom might {{have been influenced by}} Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) and which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites: the Diplodocus in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia - a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII's carriage is based on the British Royal Family's Gold State Coach.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1975, {{the four}} European partners, {{now known as}} the European Participation Group, signed up for 348 {{aircraft}} at the Paris Air Show. This was split among the European Participation Air Forces (EPAF) as 116 <b>for</b> <b>Belgium,</b> 58 for Denmark, 102 for the Netherlands, and 72 for Norway. Two European production lines, one in the Netherlands at Fokker's Schiphol-Oost facility and the other at SABCA's Gosselies plant in Belgium, would produce 184 and 164 units respectively. Norway's Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk and Denmark's Terma A/S also manufactured parts and subassemblies for EPAF aircraft. European co-production was officially launched on 1 July 1977 at the Fokker factory. Beginning in November 1977, Fokker-produced components were sent to Fort Worth for fuselage assembly, then shipped back to Europe for final assembly of EPAF aircraft at the Belgian plant on 15 February 1978; deliveries to the Belgian Air Force began in January 1979. The first Royal Netherlands Air Force aircraft was delivered in June 1979. In 1980, the first aircraft were delivered to the Royal Norwegian Air Force by SABCA and to the Royal Danish Air Force by Fokker.|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002.
