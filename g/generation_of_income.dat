2500|$|The ECB is {{responsible}} for the financial direction and commercial exploitation of England cricket. It raises revenue from the proceeds of sales for tickets at One Day International and Test matches in England and Wales. The ECB is also responsible for the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> from the sale of sponsorship and broadcasting rights, primarily in relation to the English team. The ECB's income in the 2007 calendar year was £93.0 million, up from £77.0 million in 2006. In 2007 the ECB distributed £31.6 million in [...] "fee payments" [...] to the eighteen first class counties, or £1.75 million per team. This subsidy is an essential source of income for the counties. It also pays certain costs of the domestic cricket programme directly, including the salaries of first class umpires and the cost of temporary floodlights at county matches.|$|E
40|$|This study applies {{stochastic}} frontier {{analysis to}} estimate the technical efficiencies of the four largest banks in South Africa, for the period 1994 to 2010, {{with regard to their}} <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>income</b> and noninterest income. Interest income and noninterest <b>income</b> <b>of</b> the banks are investigated separately using a stochastic frontier production function model. A stochastic frontier output-orientated distance function is also estimated in order to investigate the changes in interest and noninterest income for the banks. Using the stochastic production frontier model, it is found that deposits do not have any significant influence on the levels of interest and noninterest <b>incomes</b> <b>of</b> these banks. The inefficiency effects for the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>income</b> were found to significantly decline for larger values of loans and investments and interest costs, but increased with increasing values of financial capital and also increased over time. Using an alternative approach involving an output distance function for the two income variables, we find that deposits {{have a significant effect on}} the explanation of the interest and noninterest incomes and that inefficiency effects are still significant in explaining the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>incomes...</b>|$|R

Input-output, the predominant model, was employed to estimate the total economic impact of tourism. The findings of this study revealed that tourism receipts were not only contributing to the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> output and <b>income</b> <b>of</b> direct tourism related sectors but also to the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> significant output and <b>income</b> impact <b>of</b> other productive sectors of the economy through indirect and induced impact. The study findings suggest that when preparing economic policies using multipliers, they should be made with caution as coefficient of multipliers varies among sectors. The variation in multipliers could be minimized by reducing import dependency of tourism sectors which,in fact, would increase the value of multipliers of tourism related sectors as well as other closely related productive sectors of Malaysian economy...|$|R

This bimodality diminished during the nineties due to the reduction in polarization by income sources. In the same period we find that in the case of labor earnings there was a net transfer of population mass from the middle of the distribution to both extremes, which results in an increasing polarization within this income source. This phenomenon resembles the Anglo-Saxon experience of the shrinking middle class. income sources, inequality, labor market, pension benefits, polarization...|$|R

The sum of gross value added and taxes less subsidies on products for the UK economy is equal to GDP at market prices.The distribution and use of income accounts exist for all the institutional sectors.
