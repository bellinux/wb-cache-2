Our primary end point is 30 -day mortality, and secondary outcome measures include ICU length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, days of vasoactive agent support, ICU-free survival days during a 30 -day period, mechanical-ventilation-free survival days during a 30 -day period, and maximum SOFA score during the first 7 days.

40|$|It {{is noted}} {{that in order to}} {{compensate}} for the wave refraction inside the source, the boundary reflection surfaces must converge with altitude, and this implies that the most likely auroral kilometric radiation source would be a thin, local density enhancement, since the refractive <b>index</b> <b>contours</b> at its boundaries would be expected to slope inward. The ISEE observations of multiple spectral components, which are attributed to separate oscillations at different altitudes in the same enhancement, indicate a source thickness as small as 25 km and an internal wave growth threshold of roughly 40 dB, rather than the 70 - 120 dB previously believed necessary to account for auroral kilometric radiation without feedback. What is considered more significant is that the feedback model accounts for numerous aspects of the auroral kilometric radiation behavior, predicts emission at the wave growth saturation level, and leads to the conclusion that auroral kilometric radiation originates at many compact sites, each emitting a nearly monochromatic wave...|$|R

40|$|Equal {{opportunity}} {{in the provision of}} urban recreation resources has been the principal goal of most public leisure service agencies yet the reliance on the use of recreation standards in the planning of opportunities does not guarantee that equal {{opportunity in}} fact is being achieved. In order to assess equal opportunity of provision, a theoretical model is proposed that establishes an evaluative criterion based on the coincidence of same levels of the demand for recreation and of the supply of resources at the same points on a surface representing the community. The conceptual model of urban recreation that is proposed illustrates the interrelationship of the recreation supply and demand systems, the role of accessibility and perceptions in explaining the nature of participation, and the outcome of the relationship in terms of the selection of an appropriate site and the resultant experience. Using data drawn from a community survey of households (n = 1163) conducted in the town of Oakville, Ontario and an inventory of the town 2 ̆ 7 s parks (n = 114), an unconstrained gravity model was calibrated based on a structure suggested by the conceptual model. Measures of potential for the recreation demand system and for the recreation supply system were calculated directly from the gravity model employing regression coefficients as weights in the <b>index.</b> <b>Contour</b> maps were then generated which reflected the variations in both the demand for and the supply of urban recreation opportunities in the community. The recreation opportunity spatial system potential surface was created by taking the ratio of the demand and supply surfaces which, in theory, should be a smooth surface if equal opportunity is being achieved in the community. Incidences of 2 ̆ 2 supply-rich 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 supply-poor 2 ̆ 2 regions within the community are described and reasons for their occurrence offered. This surface was then compared to one generated by a traditional gravity model and differences between the two surfaces described. Implications of the conceptual model and the potential surfaces for urban recreation planning are discussed, and special attention is given to the importance of perceptions in explaining recreation behaviour in an urban context...|$|E

Structural breakdown that leads to cataract has been investigated {{in a number of}} studies; the concomitant changes in the optics, namely increases in light attenuation have also been well documented. Specific changes in the refractive index gradient that cause such attenuation, however, are not well studied because previous methods of measuring refractive index require transparent samples. The X-ray Talbot interferometric method using synchrotron radiation allows for measurement of fine changes in refractive index through lenses with opacities.

40|$|The {{eye lens}} grows {{throughout}} life by cell accrual {{on its surface}} and can change shape to adjust the focussing power of the eye. Varying concentrations of proteins in successive cell layers create a refractive index gradient. The continued growth of the lens and age-related changes in proteins render it less able to alter shape with loss of capacity {{by the end of}} the sixth decade of life. Growth and protein ageing alter the refractive index but as accurate measurement of this parameter is difficult, the nature of such alterations remains uncertain. The most accurate method to date for measuring refractive index in intact lenses has been developed at the SPring- 8 synchrotron.
