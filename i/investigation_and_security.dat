40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} to cross camera people counting that can adapt itself to a new environment without the need of manual inspection. The proposed counting model is composed {{of a pair of}} collaborative Gaussian processes (GP), which are respectively designed to count people by taking the visible and occluded parts into account. While the first GP exploits multiple visual features to result in better accuracy, the second GP instead investigates the conflicts among these features to recover the underestimate caused by occlusions. Our contributions are threefold. First, we establish a cross camera people counting system that can facilitate forensics <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> preservation. Second, a principled way is proposed to estimate the degree of occlusions. Third, our system is comprehensively evaluated on two benchmark datasets. The promising performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our system. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automatic authorship {{identification}} {{offers a}} valuable tool for supporting crime <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>security.</b> It {{can be seen as}} a multi-class, single-label text categorization task. Character n-grams are a very successful approach to represent text for stylistic purposes since they are able to capture nuances in lexical, syntactical, and structural level. So far, character n-grams of fixed length have been used for authorship identification. In this paper, we propose a variable-length n-gram approach inspired by previous work for selecting variable-length word sequences. Using a subset of the new Reuters corpus, consisting of texts on the same topic by 50 different authors, we show that the proposed approach is at least as effective as information gain for selecting the most significant n-grams although the feature sets produced by the two methods have few common members. Moreover, we explore the significance of digits for distinguishing between authors showing that an increase in performance can be achieved using simple text pre-processing. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{assess the}} {{randomization}} strategy {{that had been}} used in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). Document experts at a private <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>security</b> company were hired to assist in reviewing instances in which names of subjects were altered in the "allocation books" (the basic instrument used to assign, at random, participants to either the mammography or the usual-care arm). The review was restricted to records from 3 NBSS centres where women assigned to the mammography arm had a distinctly higher (not necessarily significant) number of deaths from breast cancer than those assigned to the usual-care arm, and to records from 2 centres where, for limited periods, administrative problems were reported. In most cases the underlying, original name could be identified. The document experts found no evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal the alterations. A search of the NBSS database for the underlying and superimposed names revealed that only 1 of the women whose name had been deleted or superimpsed died of breast cancer. She was in the mammography arm. The authors' thorough review of ways in which the randomization could have been subverted failed to uncover credible evidence of it. They conclude that even if there had been acts of subversion, they could only have been few in number and, given that there was only 1 death from breast cancer in the group reviewed, the alterations could have had only a trivial effect on the study findings as reported in 1992...|$|E
40|$|Ralph Hackley, an African American, was {{employed}} as an investigator within the Veteran Administration 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> Service Division. He had served {{for one year}} at the GS- 12 level when he was denied promotion. Hackley complained that this denial was based solely upon his race. The charge was investigated and he was afforded a hearing before a complaints examiner, who ruled {{that there had been}} no discrimination. This finding was adopted by the Veteran 2 ̆ 7 s Administration. Upon appeal, the Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission affirmed. Having thus exhausted his administrative remedies, plaintiff commenced a civil action in the District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to section 717 (c) of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEOA). He sought injunctive relief, retroactive promotion, and back pay, plus a declaratory judgment to the effect that he was to be free from discrimination. The district court, in Hackley v. Johnson (Hackley 1), granted the government 2 ̆ 7 s motion for summary judgment, holding that it only had jurisdiction to consider whether Hackley had been afforded administrative due process before the Civil Service Commission and that he had, in fact, received due process during the administrative hearing. In Hackley v. Roudebush (Hackley II), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, remanding Hackley 2 ̆ 7 s claim of discrimination for trial, concluding, inter alia, that section 717 (c) 2 ̆ 7 s grant of a private right of action requires the district court to conduct a trial de novo in civil actions filed under the section. In so ruling, the court fell into line with several other jurisdictions which had held that the vindication of a federal employee 2 ̆ 7 s rights under EEOA required more than mere review of the administrative record...|$|E
