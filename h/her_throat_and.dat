5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
25|$|Price {{repeated}} her testimony, {{adding that}} the black teenagers split into two groups of six to rape her and Ruby Bates. Price accused Eugene Williams of holding the knife to <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> said {{that all of the}} other teenagers had knives. Under cross examination she gave more detail, adding that someone held a knife to the white teenager, Gilley, during the rapes.|$|E
25|$|Hulda Stumpf lay {{across the}} bed with a {{mattress}} doubled over her face. I was the second person to enter the room after the tragedy, and I made a careful examination of her poor body. She had been brutally treated but was not, as the story was circulated, {{the victim of a}} bungling attempt at circumcision. That finally she had been strangled was evident by the large black and blue patches on <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> neck. She was safe on the other side, but had had a rough passage.|$|E

25|$|On Day 33, Daley {{became the}} first housemate to be ejected from the Big Brother House since the show moved to Channel 5. The {{ejection}} was due to Daley's threatening behaviour towards Hazel. Channel 5 later chose to broadcast the footage that caused the ejection which showed Daley slap Hazel's behind, clasp her by <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> pin her down against her bed. This resulted in Ofcom receiving a total of 60 complaints and it was later confirmed that they had launched an investigation. Daley was later banned from appearing on the show's final.|$|E
25|$|Caffell {{had spent}} time in a {{psychiatric}} hospital being treated for schizophrenia months before the murders. The police believed that she was responsible until Bamber's girlfriend told them he had implicated himself. The prosecution case included {{that there was no}} evidence that Bamber's father had telephoned him. They argued that the father was too badly injured to have spoken to anyone; that there was no blood on the kitchen phone; and that he would have called the police, not Bamber. They also argued that the silencer was on the gun when the shots were fired, and that Caffell's reach was not long enough to hold the gun and silencer at <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> press the trigger. In addition she was not strong enough, they said, to have overcome her father in what appeared to have been a violent struggle in the kitchen.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, she {{was rushed}} to {{hospital}} when a fish bone became stuck in <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> had an operation to remove it. Being a keen angler, she calmly joked afterwards, [...] "The salmon have got their own back." [...] Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary overnight but no operation was needed, and May 1993, when she {{was admitted to the}} Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic.|$|E

500|$|Ariel has {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the character, writing that [...] "Ariel is a fully realized female character who thinks and acts independently, even rebelliously, instead of hanging around passively while the fates decide her destiny". James Bernardelli of Reelviews wrote that Ariel {{can be viewed as}} a template for future Disney heroes and heroines. He also praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance for the character. In an article for Empire, Levi Buchanan stated that Ariel is [...] "powerful and self-reliant". Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented Ariel, stating that [...] "teenagers will appreciate the story's rebellious heroine" [...] and went on to praise Ariel's wit. Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend wrote favorably about Ariel although he believed that the character was eroticized, stating, [...] "The scene where Ursula rips out <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> gives her extremely naked parts below the waist is almost titillating, though I'm sure to little kids it seems entirely innocent". Similarly, reviewer John Puccio said that [...] "Ariel is perhaps the sexiest-looking animated character the Disney artists have ever drawn". In his review of Ariel's Beginning, James Plath of DVD Town wrote, [...] "For little girls, Ariel is one of the most beloved of Disney princesses, and she holds a warm place in the hearts of parents as well". Rory Aronsky of Film Threat praised Jodi Benson's vocal performance in Ariel's Beginning, writing that [...] "Benson adds more to the appeal of Ariel for older fans, and younger girls just learning about her, as well as generations not born yet who will undoubtedly become attached to her, ensuring the continued existence of the franchise".|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E

2500|$|Martin's body {{showed signs}} of having been beatenperhaps with a rockand strangled. She had bruises on <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh. Her autopsy found {{the cause of death}} to be {{strangulation}} and stated that she had [...] "suffered the molestation of a degenerate".|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen {{spoke with her}} friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> her head was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. [...] You want to pretend that they're just an object".|$|E
2500|$|January 9, 1997: Nine-year-old [...] "Girl X" [...] (since {{identified}} as Shatoya Currie) {{found in a}} seventh-floor stairwell at 1121 N. Larrabee Street after being raped, beaten, choked, poisoned by having a can of insecticide sprayed down <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> covered in gang symbols. Her attacker then stepped on her throat. She was left for dead. Ultimately, the attacker was {{identified as}} Patrick Sykes and was found {{with the assistance of}} community members and building gang members, all of whom were outraged by the attack. [...] Sykes had a history of sexual crimes against women and girls, and admitted he covered Currie with gang symbols in an attempt to confuse investigators. Currie survived, but was blinded and left with significant brain damage. During her hospitalization, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan visited and prayed at her bedside.|$|E

2500|$|Merman's next show, Humpty Dumpty, began rehearsals in August 1932 and opened—and {{immediately}} closed—in Pittsburgh {{the following}} month. Producer Buddy DeSylva, {{who also had}} written the book and lyrics, was certain it could be reworked into a success, and with a revamped script and additional songs by Vincent Youmans, it opened with the new title Take a Chance on November 26 at the 42nd Street Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 243 performances. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it [...] "fast, loud, and funny" [...] and added Merman [...] "has never loosed herself with quite so much abandon." [...] Following the Broadway run, she agreed to join the show on the road, but shortly after the Chicago opening, she claimed the chlorine in the city's water supply was irritating <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> returned to Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{outstanding}} {{examples of}} his portraits include The Agnew Clinic (1889), Eakins' most important commission and largest painting, which depicted another eminent American surgeon, Dr. David Hayes Agnew, performing a mastectomy; The Dean's Roll Call (1899), featuring Dr. James W. Holland, and Professor Leslie W. Miller (1901), portraits of educators standing as if addressing an audience; {{a portrait of}} Frank Hamilton Cushing (ca. 1895), in which the prominent ethnologist is seen performing an incantation in a Zuñi pueblo; [...] (1897), a brilliant scientist whose study of spectroscopy revolutionized his field; Antiquated Music (1900), in which Mrs. William D. Frishmuth is shown seated amidst her collection of musical instruments; and The Concert Singer (1890–92), for which Eakins asked Weda Cook to sing [...] "O rest in the Lord", {{so that he could}} study the muscles of <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> mouth. In order to replicate the proper deployment of a baton, Eakins enlisted an orchestral conductor to pose for the hand seen in the lower left-hand corner of the painting.|$|E
2500|$|After six {{generations of}} gods, in the Babylonian Enûma Eliš, {{in the seventh}} generation, (Akkadian [...] "shapattu" [...] or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, {{the sons and daughters}} of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping the {{creation}} working. Abzu God of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the Gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides to take back the creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat's consort, for irrigation refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, God of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by Marduk, Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is Asshur. After dispatching Tiamat with the [...] "arrows of his winds" [...] down <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of [...] "who will keep the cosmos working". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother Nammu (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) [...] "brings the tears of the gods" [...] before Enki and says ...|$|E
