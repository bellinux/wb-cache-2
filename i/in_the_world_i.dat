After Experimental Jet Set, the band {{decided to take}} a hiatus from performing live and concentrated on numerous side projects. Band member Kim Gordon played with Julia Cafritz of Pussy Galore in Free Kitten, drummer Steve Shelley performed with Jad Fair in Mosquito, guitarist Lee Ranaldo played with free jazz drummer William Hooker and singer/guitarist Thurston Moore released his first solo album, Psychic Hearts. Moore and Gordon also had their first child, Coco. According to Moore, their daughter had provided a different perspective for the band: [...] "I'm more focused and level-headed.

500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again more than anything <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles I {{became the}} English monarch in 1625, and the {{situation}} grew worse for Puritans; an increased number of them moved to the Netherlands. [...] Charles tended to be inflexible, {{but he would not}} compromise with his rivals. [...] This resulted in Parliament becoming dominated by Puritans, followed by civil war in the 1640s. [...] Under Charles, the Anglican church reverted to more ceremonial worship, approaching that of Catholicism, and there was increased hostility towards the Calvinism that Cotton followed. [...] Cotton's colleagues were being summoned to the High Court for their Puritan practices, but he continued to thrive because of his supportive aldermen and sympathetic superiors, as well as his conciliatory demeanor. [...] Minister Samuel Ward of Ipswich remarked, [...] "Of all men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>I</b> envy Mr. Cotton, of Boston, most; for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I do everything that way, and cannot enjoy mine." ...|$|E

[...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him."

500|$|On {{the sixth}} day of trial, alcohol tax agent Patrick Donoghue testified that, {{in a case}} that Donoghue had investigated, Glasser persuaded a grand jury to reverse itself after {{returning}} an indictment by placing the matter on the pending call indefinitely. Another government witness, bootlegging handyman Ralph Sharp testified that he had paid Kretske $250 in order for Kretske, as prosecutor, to recommend that the charges against him be dismissed (which they were). Frank Hodorowicz, another bootlegger turned government witness, testified that he had paid Kretske $1,300 to recommend the dismissal of two cases and was convicted in the third case after he refused to pay $1,000. After he was indicted the third time, he testified, Glasser declined to intervene on his behalf, saying: [...] "You're going to jail for five years; I can't do anything about it.

500|$|Riegels {{sent letters}} to athletes who made similar mistakes.

Riegels wrote in the letter: [...] "For many years I've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. But it certainly wasn't the most serious thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> regretted doing it, even as you do, but you'll get over it." [...] In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27–22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading [...] "Welcome to the club".|$|E

As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> could not believe it...

[...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was like this is a beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; puerperal (childbed) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again."

[...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|E

500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) [...] "surprising compelling". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>I</b> don't feel that marriage {{was ever going to}} last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] between Steph and Gilly. Their relationship was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that she and Jem would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She highlighted a lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, you know that the moment she says that nothing is going to stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E
500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else."

He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>I</b> feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp of having sex with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E
