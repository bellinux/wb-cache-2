40|$|The Rey - Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test assess visual-construction abilility, {{visual memory}} and {{executive}} function. Three different methods are traditionally used {{to track and}} to record the strokes during {{the production of the}} complex figure: single <b>pen,</b> switching <b>felt</b> <b>pens</b> and flowcharts. The Inkling™ is an instrument which attributes are to track, to record and to save the information of every stroke depicted in a standard piece of paper. The purpose of the study is to examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using the Inkling™ in the ROCF test. 66 ROCF performances were analyzed from subjects aged 6 to 86 years old. Each subject performed the ROCF test twice; first with pen switching method without flowcharts and later with the Inkling™ or viceversa. The comparison of the performances evidenced 5 characteristics: Four subjects distracted by the color of the <b>felt</b> <b>pens,</b> three subjects interfered by the switching of the <b>felt</b> <b>pens,</b> three subjects which performance was facilitated by the colors of the <b>felt</b> <b>pens,</b> nine subjects with unclear score for Fragmentation and fourteen subjects with unclear score for Planning. The advantages that the Inkling™ showed were compensation for the process of flowcharts, avoid interference, and reduce the burden of unclear scoring for Fragmentation and Planning...|$|R

50|$|Holtz creates his scenes after researching locations, {{and often}} uses locals as models. He paints slowly {{and with great}} care, but with a swift Impressionistic style. The people in his portraits and scenes are {{generally}} more cheerful and optimistic than standard portraits of Hassidic individuals. He paints oils and watercolors, and also does <b>felt</b> <b>pen,</b> pastel, marker, ink and charcoal drawings, as well as woodcuts. His oil paintings typically have a brown hue, while his work with <b>felt</b> <b>pen</b> is often in sepia tones, and on some of his works he used very bright colors, with {{a strong emphasis on}} the interplay of light and shadow. He is heavily influenced by the ancient staircases and alleyways of Jerusalem, with its modest religious population, which has made a strong impression on him in his youth, the streets of Tzfat, and the works of Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer and Peter Bruegel, as well as Jewish artists Moritz Daniel Oppenheim, Leonid Pasternak and Isidor Kaufmann have had a strong influence on him. He has said that realism is the best way he can express himself.|$|E

For his work as a ceramicist he used mostly grog (also called firesand or chamotte). He never used the wheel, but built up his pieces by hand, in the traditional way.|$|R
