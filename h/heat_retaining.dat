25|$|The steep river bank slopes {{that are}} {{scattered}} around the Mosel region are considered {{some of the most}} labor-intensive vineyards in the world. Mechanical harvesting is impractical and nearly seven times more man hours are needed in the Mosel than in flatter terrain such as the Médoc. Grapevines are individually staked to the ground without connecting wires so that vineyard workers can tend the plants going horizontally across the vineyard rather than vertically, which would be more treacherous and tiring. Safety is a priority for many Mosel vineyard owners with the area having a documented history of fatalities among workers while tending the vines. A benefit of the steep Mosel vineyards is that the incline allows for more direct sunlight to have contact with the vines. During the winter, rain often causes some soil erosion, especially of the vital slate chips that are needed for their <b>heat</b> <b>retaining</b> properties. Many vineyards will gather these eroded sediments and carry them back up the hillside.|$|E
25|$|Grenache prefers hot, dry soils {{that are}} well drained but it {{relatively}} adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets roulés <b>heat</b> <b>retaining</b> stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retain enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. The skin of Grenache is thin and lightly pigmented, making wines with pale color and low tannins. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produced darker, more tannic wines such as {{those found in the}} Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines than those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, wood fire flues {{are often}} {{built into a}} heat {{preserving}} construction within which the flue gases circulate over <b>heat</b> <b>retaining</b> bricks before release to the atmosphere. The <b>heat</b> <b>retaining</b> bricks are covered in a decorative material such as brick, tiles or stone.

The heat from the flue gases is absorbed quickly by the bricks and then released slowly to the house rather than the chimney. In a well insulated home, a single load fire burning for {{one and a half}} hours twice a day is enough to keep an entire home warm for a 24-hour period.

The design philosophy is to eliminate the use of heating elements requiring electric power which is poorly supplied in the country. Design drawings were produced and mild steel was used for the fabrication of the furnace casing, while the other components needed for the design were selected based on functionality, durability, cost and local availability. The furnace was assembled by lining the inner wall of the casing with refractory blocks made from heated mixture of kaolin, clay, sawdust and water after which the inner pot and electro technical devices (temperature controller, light indicator etc) were positioned. Testing was subsequently performed to evaluate the performance of the furnace.

40|$|Our study {{combines}} eddy flux measurements {{from four}} different sites with distinct land cover characteristics with an urban canopy model {{to understand the}} influence of urban materials and morphology on the surface energy budget. Turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor and other micrometeorological variables were continuously sampled from four different sites (UMBC, Cubhill, Princeton and Broadmead) located in the North Eastern United States. Of the four sites, UMBC and Princeton were located in dense urban areas, while their counterparts Cubhill and Broadmead were located in a suburban and a rural environment, respectively. Our preliminary analysis has shown that while the latent heat flux dominates at the rural and suburban sites, the more urbanized UMBC and Princeton sites were dominated by sensible heat flux. This is expected and could directly {{be attributed to the}} vegetative cover fraction surrounding the respective sites. A more interesting finding is that, over the more urbanized surfaces, a considerable shift in peak flux times can be noted due to the <b>heat</b> <b>retaining</b> capacity of urban materials, especially concrete. To quantitatively assess these effects, the Princeton Urban Canyon Model (PUCM) was used. PUCM combines basic meteorological data with aerodynamic and geometric properties of built environment and thermal properties of built and vegetated surfaces to estimate the surface energy budget for urban canopies. The model was able to reproduce the shift in peaks observed in the eddy flux data at the densely urban site (UMBC). The sector-averaged fluxes produced by the model show relatively high sensible heat fluxes from sectors filled with asphalt and concrete. Moreover a significant phase shift was observed in sensible heat fluxes emitted by different urban surfaces...|$|E
