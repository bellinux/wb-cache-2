5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the <b>faders</b> of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{tracked the}} final mixes {{of the songs}} at Caribbean Sound Basin. Its main studio used a 64-channel SSL 4064 G mixing console, the {{secondary}} studio used a 48-track Neve console with flying <b>faders,</b> and its third studio used an Amek BC2 console. The group mostly used the older Neve console. In tracking the songs, they started with a drum machine groove as a basic track and recorded it. The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix. Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live. Sons of Soul was subsequently mastered by engineer Herb Powers at his New York City studio P.M. Entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Ace Tone commercialized its preset rhythm machine, {{called the}} FR-1 Rhythm Ace, in 1967. It offered 16 preset patterns, and four buttons to {{manually}} play each instrument sound (cymbal, claves, cowbell and bass drum). The rhythm patterns {{could also be}} cascaded together by pushing multiple rhythm buttons simultaneously, and the possible combination of rhythm patterns {{were more than a}} hundred (on the later models of Rhythm Ace, the individual volumes of each instrument could be adjusted with the small knobs or <b>faders).</b> The FR-1 was adopted by the Hammond Organ Company for incorporation within their latest organ models. In the US, the units were also marketed under the Multivox brand by Peter Sorkin Music Company, and in the UK, marketed under the Bentley Rhythm Ace brand.|$|E
25|$|DJ mixers {{are small}} audio mixing {{consoles}} specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer {{used by a}} record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have {{many of the same}} features found on larger mixers (<b>faders,</b> equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.|$|E

50|$|A {{benefit of}} VCA {{sub-group}} {{is that since}} it is directly affecting the gain level of each channel, changes to a VCA sub-group level affect not only the channel level, but also all of the levels sent to any post <b>fader</b> mixes. With traditional audio sub-groups, the sub-group master <b>fader</b> only affects the level going into the main mix and {{does not affect the}} level going to the post <b>fader</b> mixes. Consider the case of an instrument feeding a sub-group and a post <b>fader</b> mix. If you completely lower the sub-group master <b>fader,</b> you would no longer hear the instrument itself, but you would still hear it as part of the post <b>fader</b> mix, perhaps a reverb or chorus effect.|$|R
