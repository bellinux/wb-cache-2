25|$|Conventionally, the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> {{at which}} the volume density of {{electrons}} in the inversion layer {{is the same as}} the volume density of holes in the body is called the threshold voltage. When the voltage between transistor gate and source (VGS) exceeds the threshold voltage (Vth), the difference is known as overdrive voltage.|$|E

40|$|Controlled {{reaction}} kinetics of the bio-catalytic system of microperoxidase- 11 and hydrogen peroxide {{has been achieved}} using an electrostatic technique. The technique allowed independent control of 1) the thermodynamics of the system using electrochemical setup and 2) the quantum mechanical tunneling at the interface between microperoxidase- 11 and the working electrode by applying a <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> to the electrode. The cathodic currents of electrodes immobilized with microperoxidase- 11 showed a dependence on the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide, indicating a controllable reduction reaction. The measured kinetic parameters of the bio-catalytic reduction showed nonlinear dependences on the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> as the result of modified interfacial electron tunnel due to the field induced at the microperoxidase- 11 -electrode interface. Our results indicate that the kinetics of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide can be controlled by a <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> and illustrate the operation of a field-effect bio-catalytic transistor, whose current-generating mechanism is the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water with the current being controlled by the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present {{transport}} {{measurements of}} a tunable silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot device with lateral geometry. Experimentally extracted gate-to-dot capacitances {{show that the}} device is largely symmetric under the <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> applied. Intriguingly, these <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> themselves are not symmetric. Comparison with numerical simulations indicates that the applied <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> serve to offset an intrinsic asymmetry in the physical device. We also show a transition from a large single dot to two well isolated coupled dots, where the central gate of the device is used to controllably tune the interdot coupling.

25|$|For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source {{voltages}} {{much less}} than gate-to-source voltages, changing the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET {{is said to be}} operating in a linear mode or ohmic mode.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{conductance}} of {{ionic current}} flow {{is controlled by}} the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage,</b> using a material with high dielectric constant as the wall of the channel is desired. In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance. A channel surface with a low surface charge is also desired in order to strengthen the effect of potential tuning by gate electrode. This increases the ability to spatially and temporally tune the ionic and electrostatic environment in the channel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by {{the position of the}} Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect is to increase the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure. This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the 'body effect'.|$|E
25|$|To {{improve the}} {{measured}} signal in Auger electron spectroscopy, the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is scanned in a linear ramp. An RC circuit serves to derive the second derivative, {{which is then}} amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are summed up. The first derivative is very large due to the residual capacitive coupling between gate and the anode and may degrade {{the performance of the}} circuit. By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q RLC circuit is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.|$|E
25|$|DIBL and VT roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel {{formation}} {{is not entirely}} done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage (VT) {{a function of the}} length of the channel. This is called VT roll-off. VT also becomes function of drain to source voltage VDS. As we increase the VDS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the VDS. The <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the VT decreases with an increase in VDS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).|$|E

40|$|An insulator-to-metal {{transition}} is observed in trilayer graphene {{based on the}} temperature dependence of the resistance under different applied <b>gate</b> <b>voltages.</b> At small <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> the resistance decreases with increasing temperature due {{to the increase in}} carrier concentration resulting from thermal excitation of electron-hole pairs. At large <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> excitation of electron-hole pairs is suppressed, and the resistance increases with increasing temperature because of the enhanced electron-phonon scattering. We find that the simple model with overlapping conduction and valence bands, each with quadratic dispersion relations, is unsatisfactory. Instead, we conclude that impurities in the substrate that create local puddles of higher electron or hole densities are responsible for the residual conductivity at low temperatures. The best fit is obtained using a continuous distribution of puddles. From the fit the average of the electron and hole effective masses can be determined. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a <b>gate</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E

A subsequent upshift in the Raman frequency at higher <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> {{results in a}} “W”-shaped Raman shift profile that agrees well with a nonadiabatic phonon renormalization model.

40|$|We study {{transport}} {{through two}} quantum dots in series. Electron-electron interactions {{are taken into}} account in the capacitive model with an additional interdot capacitance. The tunneling rates between the dots and the outside reservoirs are assumed to be weak, therefore we treat it perturbatively and derive a master equation. The interdot tunneling is treated in two limits: weak interdot tunneling is included perturbatively, whereas in the opposite limit we assume {{that there is only one}} level in the dot in the relevant energy range such that the Hamiltonian of the dots can be diagonalized exactly. We calculate the current through the structure as a function of the two <b>gate</b> <b>voltages.</b> The well-known Coulomb oscillations of a single dot are changed into a characteristic structure of boomerang-like shape.

50|$|CMOS {{circuits}} {{are constructed}} {{in such a}} way that all PMOS transistors must have either an input from the voltage source or from another PMOS transistor. Similarly, all NMOS transistors must have either an input from ground or from another NMOS transistor. The composition of a PMOS transistor creates low resistance between its source and drain contacts when a low <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied and high resistance when a high <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied. On the other hand, the composition of an NMOS transistor creates high resistance between source and drain when a low <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied and low resistance when a high <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied. CMOS accomplishes current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET to not conduct, while a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation. However, during the switching time, both MOSFETs conduct briefly as the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> goes from one state to another.
