Classifying {{handwriting}} into {{a writer}} demographic category, e. g., gender, age, or handedness of the writer, {{is useful for}} more detailed analysis such as writer verification and identification. This paper describes classification into binary demographic categories using <b>document</b> <b>macro</b> features and several different classification methods: a single feed-forward neural network classifier and combinations of neural network classifiers based on boosting and bagging. The textual content of each document was the same, consisting of a full page of writing, and eleven macro features were used. Training set sizes for gender, age and handedness populations were 800, 650 and 300 respectively for each class. Test set sizes were 400, 350 and 150 respectively. Classification accuracy using a single neural network was: 73. 2 %, 82. 7 %, and 68. 5 %. Performance improved {{with the number of}} classifiers combined, saturating at around ten neural networks: combined by bagging: 74. 7 %, 83. 4 %, and 70. 1 %; and combined by boosting: 77. 5 %, 86. 6 %, and 74. 4 %. Accuracies achieved by boosting are significantly higher than what has been observed before for demographic classification. Results also show the promise of the boosting technique for weak classifiers. 1...|$|E

40|$|In the Internet, {{mobile code}} is {{ubiquitous}} and includes such examples as browser plug-ins, Java applets, and <b>document</b> <b>macros.</b> In this paper, we address an important vulnerability in mobile code security {{that exists in}} remote execution systems such as Condor, Globus, and SETI@Home. These systems schedule user jobs for execution on remote idle machines. However, they send most of their important system calls back to the local machine for execution. Hence, an evil process on the remote machine can manipulate a user’s job to send destructive system calls back to the local machine. We have developed techniques to remotely detect such manipulation. Before the job is submitted for remote execution, we construct {{a model of the}} user’s binary program using static analysis. This binary analysis is applicable to commodity remote execution systems and applications. During remote job execution, the model checks all system calls arriving at the local machine. Execution is only allowed to continue while the model remains valid. We begin with a finite-state machine model that accepts sequences of system calls and then build optimizations into the model to improve its precision and efficiency. We also propose two program transformations, renaming and null call insertion, that {{have a significant impact on}} the precision and efficiency. As a desirable side-effect, these techniques also obfuscate the program, thus making it harder for the adversary to reverse engineer the code. We have implemented a simulated remote execution environment to demonstrate how optimizations and transformations of the binary program increase the precision and efficiency. In our test programs, unoptimized models increase run-time by 0. 5 % or less. At moderate levels of optimization, run-time increases by less than 13 % with precision gains reaching 74 %...|$|R

The advantage of the proposed methods with respect to previous ones using exact formal concepts [2, 4, 11], is that by only selecting approximate formal concepts associated to the different pairs of a binary relation linking documents or sentences inside a document to indexing words, we improve the structuring process {{in terms of time}} complexity while keeping acceptable meaning of generated text structure. Experimentation [12] realized with documents with big size showed that response time of the structuring system as well as the browsing trees are very helpful for users to get the global structured view of the space of documents and the detailed view inside a selected document.

40|$|Domestic {{political}} circumstances, textbook controversies, {{and international}} pressure to revise education policy constituted {{the context of}} influence for the curriculum policy’s ideological shift in 2006 towards greater democratic pluralism. However, the extent of this ideological shift in the journey from policy to enacted practice-via the mediation of textbook content and teaching-has not been previously explored. This study investigated the trajectory of curriculum policy associated with secondary school Pakistan Studies, focusing specifically on the themes of Pakistani national identity, cultural diversity, and global perspectives-and the instructional strategies deployed in addressing these themes. The policy trajectory model (Bowe, Ball, & Gold, 1992) {{was used as an}} analytical framework. This model facilitated the examination of three policy contexts macro policy text production (curriculum documents), meso policy text production (textbooks) and teachers’ practice. Qualitative content analysis of the Pakistan Studies curriculum policy documents was conducted to understand the policy objectives and recommendations for the teaching of Pakistani national identity, cultural diversity, and global perspectives. Similarly, qualitative content analysis of the official Pakistan Studies textbooks was undertaken to understand policy text production and treatment of the identified identity themes. Lastly, cross-case analysis of the purposeful sample of 27 teachers was conducted to understand the perceptions, practices, and suggestions of teachers related to the same themes. The findings of this study revealed differences between curriculum policy <b>documents</b> (<b>macro</b> level), textbooks (meso level), and teachers (micro level) as to the discourses they privilege around national identity, cultural diversity, and global perspectives in Pakistan Studies. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the gradual permeation of the theocratic discourse in Pakistan Studies from the macro to micro levels of curriculum policy enactment. At the macro level, the dominant conception of Pakistani national identity was held in an uneasy tension—with attempts to face in two directions at once but edging towards the promotion of more pluralistic practices. However, at the meso level, the Pakistan Studies textbooks mainly incorporated the nation-statist/Islamist conception of Pakistani national identity. At the micro level, most of the teachers subscribed to Islamist and nation-statist national identity. With respect to ethnic and religious diversity, the objectives and learning outcomes at the macro level were progressive in intent. However, the textbooks generally paid limited attention to the representation of ethnic and religious diversity. Most of the teachers’ reported practices indicated that they confined themselves to the teaching of limited content on representation of ethnic and religious diversity because of time constraints, large classes, and an examination system that overwhelmingly only assesses students’ knowledge of the textbook content. At the macro level, the objectives and learning outcomes of the Pakistan Studies curriculum aimed to cultivate affinity with the non-Muslim world as well as the Muslim world. However, the textbooks focused largely upon cultivating students’ affinity with the Muslim world and used non-emotive language in the description of non-Muslim organisations. Most of the teachers had a greater inclination towards nationalism than Muslim Ummah or humanity in general. Finally, most of the curriculum policy’s recommended instructional strategies were not identified in the reported practices of the teachers. The liberal-democratic discourse of Pakistan Studies promulgated at the macro level seemed to disperse at the micro level. Therefore, it is argued that there would be merit in more tightly linking the various curriculum policy contexts. This could be implemented by ensuring awareness of roles and responsibilities at each level and by introducing the various policy enactors to the complexities of teaching about Pakistani national identity, cultural diversity, and global perspectives through various policy dissemination strategies. For policy makers, redressing the state exam policy appears to be the most urgent and effective measure to adopt in order for any future curriculum reform to flourish because this study’s data showed that state exams were the key determinant of the relatively narrow classroom practice...|$|R

By researching secondary English language <b>documents,</b> I examine <b>macro</b> and micro level socio-economic transformations that occurred following the 1952 Bolivian Revolution. Although the Revolution established the preconditions for the incorporation of peasants into national economic life, post-Revolutionary structural processes at the macro level blocked the full integration of these peasants into national economic structures. Marginalized by macro economic forces, peasants in the La Paz highlands re-created community institutions and practices to ensure the reproduction of households and communities. Although peasants had some command over their production activities and relations, the autonomy to fully control their economic circumstances was restricted by national policies and processes. I argue that this constrained autonomy, as well as reliance on the community for survival, engendered the collective organization of these peasants during the 1970 s.

40|$|Many {{indigenous}} peoples’ {{languages in}} the world are endangered. But the special case in Greenland is the fact that Greenlandic is not an endangered language, even though less than 56, 000 people speak Greenlandic. In fact, Greenlandic is spreading in Greenlandic society. The challenge in Greenland is rather how to educate Greenlanders to become functionally bilingual in Greenlandic and Danish, considering the vast varieties of bilingual skills that exist. Greenland has been a Danish colony since 1721 but achieved Home Rule in 1979 and an increased form of self-determination called ‘Self Rule’ in 2009. With the introduction of Self Rule the Greenlandic language has raised its status and become the official language in Greenland. Greenland is dependent on the annual block grant that it receives from the Danish state. In order for the country to create a self-sustaining economy, Greenland needs to invest in education. Today it is crucial for young Greenlanders wanting a further education to learn Danish, because Greenland lacks educational material and books in Greenlandic. But the amount of people who receive a further education is limited due to lack of Danish skills. The amount of people who will go on to receive further education in the future is crucial in the process of increased self-determination. Analysing official <b>documents</b> at <b>macro</b> level, i. e. at government level, this Master’s thesis studies the sociolinguistic paradoxes within the contemporary official language policy and planning situation in Greenland, concentrating primarily on language education policy in Greenlandic state schools. Factors affecting language policy in Greenland are those of: history, decolonisation, language emancipation, self-determination, nationalism, ideology and power. This Master’s thesis argues that one of the critical issues in official Greenlandic language policy is the absence of a clear definition of the status and role of the Danish language in Greenlandic society, which needs to be clarified more professionally at legislative, political and pedagogical levels. The second critical issue is the approach to an effective bilingual education system where pupils become functionally bilingual. Additionally there is a the lack of defining terms such as mother tongue, second language, foreign language, bilingualism and multilingualism in depth in a Greenlandic context; terms which ought to be used in a more adequate and conscious manner by policymakers and pedagogical leaders...|$|R
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{construction of}} the functional integral over coset spaces M/ G is reviewed. The inner product on the cotangent space of infinitesimal deformations of M defines an invariant distance and volume form, or functional integration measure on the full configuration space. Then, by a simple change of coordinates parameterizing the gauge fiber G, the functional measure on the coset space M/ G is deduced. This change of integration variables leads to a Jacobian which is entirely equivalent to the Faddeev-Popov determinant of the more traditional gauge fixed approach in non-abelian gauge theory. If the general construction {{is applied to the}} case where G is the group of coordinate reparametrizations of spacetime, the continuum functional integral over geometries, i. e. metrics modulo coordinate reparameterizations may be defined. The invariant functional integration measure is used to derive the trace anomaly and effective action for the conformal part of the metric in two and four dimensional spacetime. In two dimensions this approach generates the Polyakov-Liouville action of closed bosonic non-critical string theory. In four dimensions the corresponding effective action leads to novel conclusions on the importance of quantum effects in gravity in the far infrared, and in particular, a dramatic modification of the classical Einstein theory at cosmological distance scales, signaled first by the quantum instability of classical de Sitter spacetime. Finite volume scaling relations for the functional integral of quantum gravity in two and four dimensions are derived, and comparison with the discretized dynamical triangulation approach to the integration over geometries are discussed.

40|$|This is {{an account}} of {{qualitative}} ethnographic case study research investigating the identity construction of English as a Second Language (ESL) teachers. This study was conducted at a higher education (HE) college, namely, Public High College (PHC) in Oman {{over a period of}} six months. In this study, I explore teacher identities in relation to the particular spatial locations of the teachers as well as the ways that networking and social capital and institutionalised cultural capital intersected with their nationalities and linguistic backgrounds to produce complex hierarchies. The thesis provides a rich exposition of teacher identity construction in Omani HE as theorised through the lens of Bourdieu, recognising the different educational practices, such as assessment and teacher evaluation, as well as the influence of space in the field of struggle within which teacher identities were implicated. The methodological approach and research design adopted in this study was dictated in part {{by the nature of the}} research questions and the theoretical framework adopted. Because I was interested in the embedded struggles in different educational practices between different groups and how these groups articulated and expressed these struggles, I positioned my research within a constructivist-interpretive paradigm. I adopted a case study approach and drew on ethnographic methods, such as semi-structured interviews, observation, and field notes. Over thirty-five local and non-local ESL teachers from western, Arab, African, and Asian contexts took part in this study. Furthermore, I kept a research diary to record my own experiences and decisions about my research. In addition, I analysed official <b>documents</b> from <b>macro,</b> meso, and micro levels. Both content analysis and thematic analysis were conducted to trace the tensions which were observed during my ethnography of teacher identity construction at Public High College in part produced by the emergence of new assessment procedures, and quality assurance agendas, and the Global North’s influence on the Omani HE system. In the analysis chapters (Chapters Five to Seven), I problematise how educational practices were implicated in the production of hierarchical, spatial, and at times, male-female positioning of teachers. In the first analysis chapter, I conduct a documentary analysis of the national standards for the General Foundation Programmes to trace back potential tensions that were embedded in the new assessment processes and teacher appraisal procedures and the potential importance of these for teacher identity production. In Chapter Six, I examine the significance of space in producing hierarchical relations between local and non-local teachers and other hierarchies that cut across these groupings. My analysis shows that research respondents gained social capital from networking and highlights the complexity of this networking. In my final analysis chapter, I examine both assessment and teacher evaluation as the key processes through which teacher hierarchies at Public High College were produced. My analysis shows that assessment was one of the fields where struggle for positioning and legitimacy took place so that teacher identity production was bound up with assessment practices at Public High College. In addition, my analysis focuses on teacher evaluation processes in this chapter as another field where struggles for teacher positioning and legitimacy took place. My analysis interrogates both implicit and explicit teacher evaluation processes and the implications of such processes for the production of teacher identities. Through its ethnographic approach, the thesis shows the tensions, nuances, and power relations that pervade this HE institution, and examines how these were central in the production of teacher identities. It also shows the importance of taking teacher identity construction into account in the expansion and reform of Omani HE...|$|R

A review of relevant literature exposed and compared the essence of both modes of delivery. Data were collected from identified key role players on the program, which included administrators, module coordinators, course presenters, and tutors, some of the students on the program, and some of those that had discontinued their studies with the university. These were done using one-on-one semi-structured and focus group interviews, telephone interviews and questionnaires in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative data. A sample of 127 distance education students, 45 conventional students, 6 module coordinators, 10 course presenters, 4 tutors, 4 administrators, 1 instructional designer and 10 students that had discontinued their studies participated in the investigation. The data collected were analysed through the use descriptive and inferential statistics, and tabulation for the quantitative data, while the computer assisted qualitative data analysis software [CAQDAS] (Atlas. ti) was employed for the analysis of the transcribed interviews. From the data obtained, it was confirmed that there is a myriad of possible factors that may be responsible for the divergences in the performances, throughput and output rates of enrolled students on the BEd (Hons) Education Management, Law and Policy at the University of Pretoria. It was further revealed that South Africa has identified distance education as a tool of redressing past inequalities in higher education, a process, which the university was involved in by starting relevant programs to this end. However, even though equal access is the focus of the country, but it appeared as if little is being said about financially supporting distance education as for instance, there was no financial assistance to distance education students on the program. Due to the incursion of the university into areas, where the impact of university education had not previously being felt, its choice of the mode of delivery was limited to the print, the first generation, which was expected to bring all students on the program at par since all would have access to it. However, despite the efforts made by the university, it was discovered that there existed some gaps between the qualities of the learning experiences, which students from both modes were exposed to. Examples of those identified were lack of designated counseling unit for distance education students, and inadequate number of administrative staff {{to meet the needs of}} the ever increasing number of distance education students. However, it appeared that there were no prominent discrepancies that could be found between the two modes, and one could assume that both modes were guided by a similar underpinning philosophy, which drove the ethos of the programs that impacted on the instructional design. It was also found that there were challenges faced by the academic staff involved in the program under investigation, who felt that there might be the need for the institution to demarcate between academe interested in distance education, and those that were not, and the need for the institution to review its stand on rewards and incentives systems for staff involved in distance education. It was believed by them that this would be the way out of the dearth of research presently facing the university on this delivery mode. The study suggests that quality issues especially in relation to an African setting should be looked into, since a large percentage of the students involved in the program were from the rural areas. Finally, the study identified various limitations, and made suggestions for further research, and recommendations for improvement and immediate action.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to define trends of housing policy in Poland and Warsaw in particular, in relation to metropolitan strategies directed towards the concept of sustainability. The comparison between the country of the ex-bloc soviet and states of Western Europe is used to define the level of cohesion in the European sector of housing, of territorial management and to define the similarities and differences relating to issues that concern the new residential urbanization and management of the existing housing stock among the countries of East and West, in the context of European policies more uniform and effective. In addition, through an analysis of four documents (Agenda 21, Kyoto Protocol, Habitat Agenda, the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable Cities) concerning sustainable urban development and housing, which could be defined as the supranational level (macro), the study as aim to define their application at the local level (micro). The study of individual local cases took place for {{in order to understand the}} position of Poland in relation to trends and patterns of urban development and housing policies in Western Europe. The key to reading and translation of <b>documents</b> at the <b>macro</b> level take place through the establishment of three pillars: housing policies (social housing, energy conservation, urban renewal), the relationship between the public and private sectors (public-private partnerships, mixed enterprise companies, management of urban transformations, incentive to the local economy) and urban development strategies (government of the territory and the concept of sustainability). With these three lines were "scanned" both the local tools of urban planning and national legislation (this way take place the translation of documentation (macro) in the meso level. The background research is represented by the theories and practices of urban development, as well as by analysis of housing policies and concepts related to housing, which have developed in the modern Europe. These theories, even if often utopian, may explain some of the choices of urban development of today or make clear the difference of residential growth trends between the past and present. The garden cities (of tomorrow) of Howard and the working-class neighbourhoods of Bruno Taut, or general issues of inhabiting elaborated by the Modern Movement, which involved the whole of Europe in the early decades of the twentieth century, they are models that have guided the construction of residential neighbourhoods along the twentieth century. The application of the lecorbusian "high ideals" through the use of prefabrication after the Second World War is a very interesting aspect of the development of housing policies, which aimed above all to economization and speed in the implementation of operations under the pressure of migration and economic recovery after the war. It was essential also for research to analyze the social changes of life style, which have crossing Europe from XX century; starting from the Engels’s housing question and the opposing concepts of community and society elaborated by Ferdinand Tönnies in 1887, ending with reflections on the “corrosion of character” of the flexible man of Richard Sennett and with the importance of the community of Zygmunt Bauman (2001). In this context, for the research it was fundamentally focus the attention on the dynamics of a European society that is changing, in which the problems of housing and construction in the suburbs represent a fundamental policy today. Suburbs, which contain a combination of past trends and ideas for the future, by which we measure ourselves today. Ascolt...|$|R
