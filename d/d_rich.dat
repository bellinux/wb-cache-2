2500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} {{downtown}} Stamford had fallen prey to severe urban blight. [...] A once vibrant downtown became littered with vacant storefronts, empty lots, weak economy, unsafe and unsanitary housing. [...] The town {{leaders at the}} time sought federal and state funding to launch a revitalization effort that would restore {{the core of the}} city to a vital urban center. [...] On January 27, 1960 the City of Stamford and its redevelopment arm, the Urban Redevelopment Commission, entered into a contract with the Stamford New Urban Corporation, a subsidiary of the locally based and nationally active construction contractor the F. <b>D.</b> <b>Rich</b> Company that would lead to a dramatic altering of the face of downtown Stamford. [...] The Rich Company, led by Frank <b>D.</b> <b>Rich</b> Jr., Robert N. Rich and Chief Legal Counsel Lawrence Gochberg, actively building in 25 of the 50 United States at the time, was selected out of a field of 10 developers vying for the opportunity to become the city's sole redeveloper of the [...] section of the central downtown area known as the Southeast Quadrant. [...] More than $100 million in Federal, State and city funds were invested in a massive property acquisition, relocation, demolition and infrastructure creation program that paved the way {{for one of the most}} sweeping urban renewal efforts ever successfully carried out in the United States. [...] The plan, which involved eminent domain takings, the relocation of 1,100 families and 400 businesses, was implemented amidst much controversy and several lawsuits that delayed the start of the project until 1968 when construction commenced on the three round apartment towers, St. John's Towers. [...] These buildings still contain 360 apartments and originally served as relocation housing for some of the displaced residents. [...] Much of the deteriorated downtown was razed to make way for the new downtown, resulting in a lack of historic buildings and a downtown that looks more contemporary and modern as compared to some its New England counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{buildings}} along Tresser Boulevard, parallel to Interstate 95, had little but street-level lobby spaces, [...] garage entrances and exits accessing the street, although they presented a modern, glittering glass facade to travelers along the highway. The Rich family (which still owns F. <b>D.</b> <b>Rich</b> Co. led by President and CEO, Thomas L. Rich) was criticized for creating pedestrian-unfriendly streets, and Tresser Boulevard became notorious among many architecture and urban design critics. [...] Facts that shaped the pedestal design of the office buildings south of Tresser that are little known are as follows. [...] The high water table in that area prohibited the development of multiple levels of underground parking. [...] Therefore, parking needed to be supplied in above-ground structures which served as podiums for the office buildings providing {{the opportunity for a}} view over the adjacent highway embankment to the south. [...] The lack of retail along the Tresser Blvd. frontage is attributable to a prohibition on retail being developed in this area by the Planning Board of the City {{who did not want to}} dilute the retail existing and planned elsewhere in the renewal area.|$|E
2500|$|Dark-skinned {{people living}} in low {{sunlight}} environments have been recorded to be very susceptible to vitamin D deficiency due to reduced vitamin D synthesis. A dark-skinned person requires about six times as much UVB than lightly pigmented persons. This {{is not a problem}} near the equator; however, it can be a problem at higher latitudes. For humans with dark skin in climates of low UVR, it can take about two hours to produce the same amount of vitamin D as humans with light skin produce in 15 minutes. Dark-skinned people having a high body-mass index and not taking vitamin D supplements were associated with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D {{plays an important role in}} regulating the human immune system and chronic deficiencies in vitamin D can make humans susceptible to specific types of cancers and many kinds of infectious diseases. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing tuberculosis fivefold and also contributes to the development of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The most prevalent disease to follow vitamin D deficiency is rickets, the softening of bones in children potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is caused by reduced vitamin D synthesis that causes an absence of vitamin D, which then causes the dietary calcium to not be properly absorbed. This disease in the past was commonly found among dark-skinned Americans of the southern part of the United States who migrated north into low sunlight environments. The popularity of sugary drinks and decreased time spent outside have contributed to significant rise of developing rickets. Deformities of the female pelvis related to severe rickets impair normal childbirth, which leads to higher mortality of the infant, mother, or both. Vitamin D deficiency is most common in regions with low sunlight, especially in the winter. Chronic deficiencies in vitamin D may also be linked with breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, and possibly other types of cancers. [...] The relationship between cardiovascular disease and vitamin D deficiency also suggest link between health of cardiac and smooth muscle. Low vitamin D levels have also been linked to impaired immune system and brain functions. In addition, recent studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to autoimmune diseases, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and incidence of memory loss. Outside the tropics UVR has to penetrate through a thicker layer of atmosphere, which results in most of the UVB reflected or destroyed en route; because of this there is less potential for vitamin D biosynthesis in regions far from the equator. Higher amount of vitamin D intake for dark-skinned {{people living in}} regions with low levels of sunlight are advised by doctors to follow vitamin <b>D</b> <b>rich</b> diet or take vitamin D supplements, although there is recent evidence that dark-skinned individuals are able to process vitamin D more efficiently than lighter-skinned individuals so may have a lower threshold of sufficiency.|$|E

40|$|Integrin αvβ 3 is {{specifically}} but transiently expressed on {{the tips of}} capillary sprouts as they invade the fibrin clot during angiogenesis of cutaneous wound repair. Specific blocking of αvβ 3 function inhibits granulation tissue formation in cutaneous wounds. The mechanisms of regulation of αvβ 3 expression on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, however, have not been fully delineated. As αvβ 3 was highly expressed on capillary sprouts in 5 <b>d</b> wounds <b>rich</b> in fibrin, but was almost undetectable on blood vessels in 7 <b>d</b> wounds <b>rich</b> in collagen, we hypothesized that the extracellular matrix environment could regulate human dermal micro- vascular endothelial cell αvβ 3 expression. To address this, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on surfaces coated with collagen, fibronectin, and gelatin, and mRNA levels of integrin αv/β 3 were determined. Compared with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells on collagen, mRNA levels of αv/β 3 were higher in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells on fibronectin and on gelatin. To simulate the in vivo environment better, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells cultured on collagen were overlaid by fibrin or collagen gels prior to assessment of αv/β 3 mRNA levels. αv/β 3 mRNA levels were higher in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells surrounded by a three-dimensional fibrin gel compared with a collagen gel, whether angiogenic factors were present or absent. As modulation of mRNA stability is a potential regulatory mechanism for integrin expression, integrin subunit mRNA stability was assessed. β 3 mRNA decayed much faster than αv, α 2, and β 1 mRNA. Three-dimensional fibrin gels enhanced αv/β 3 mRNA stability compared with collagen gels. We propose that the provisional matrix molecules in the wound clot regulate angiogenesis associated with cutaneous wound repair through their modulation of integrin receptor expression...|$|R
