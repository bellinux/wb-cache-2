40|$|We {{consider}} {{design of}} the quantum stabilizer codes via a two-step, low-complexity approach based on the framework of codeword-stabilized (CWS) codes. In this framework, each quantum CWS code can be specified by a graph and a binary code. For codes that {{can be obtained from}} a given graph, we give several upper bounds on the distance of a <b>generic</b> (<b>additive</b> or non-additive) CWS code, and the lower Gilbert-Varshamov bound for the existence of additive CWS codes. We also consider additive cyclic CWS codes and show that these codes correspond to a previously unexplored class of single-generator cyclic stabilizer codes. We present several families of simple stabilizer codes with relatively good parameters. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores new {{theoretical}} {{results and}} applications of rank and select data structures. Given a string, select(c, i) gives {{the position of}} the ith occurrence of character c in the string, while rank(c, p) counts the number of instances of character c on the left of position p. Succinct rank/select data structures are space-efficient versions of standard ones, designed to keep data compressed {{and at the same time}} answer to queries rapidly. They are at the basis of more involved compressed and succinct data structures which in turn are motivated by the nowadays need to analyze and operate on massive data sets quickly, where space efficiency is crucial. The thesis builds up on the state of the art left by years of study and produces results on multiple fronts. Analyzing binary succinct data structures and their link with predecessor data structures, we integrate data structures for the latter problem in the former. The result is a data structure which outperforms the one of Patrascu 08 in a range of cases which were not studied before, namely when the lower bound for predecessor do not apply and constant-time rank is not feasible. Further, we propose the first lower bound for succinct data structures on generic strings, achieving a linear trade-off between time for rank/select execution and additional space (w. r. t. to the plain data) needed by the data structure. The proposal addresses systematic data structures, namely those that only access the underlying string through ADT calls and do not encode it directly. Also, we propose a matching upper bound that proves the tightness of our lower bound. Finally, we apply rank/select data structures to the substring counting problem, where we seek to preprocess a text and generate a summary data structure which is stored in lieu of the text and answers to substring counting queries with additive error. The results include a theory-proven optimal data structure with <b>generic</b> <b>additive</b> error and a data structure that errs only on infrequent patterns with significative practical space gains...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a change of noise amplitudes in overdamped {{diffusive}} systems is linked to their unperturbed behavior {{by means of a}} nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relation. This formula holds also for systems with state-independent nontrivial diffusivity matrices, as we show with an application to an experiment of two trapped and hydrodynamically coupled colloids, one of which is subject to an external random forcing that mimics an effective temperature. The nonequilibrium susceptibility of the energy to a variation of this driving is an example of our formulation, which improves an earlier version, as it does not depend on the time-discretization of the stochastic dynamics. This scheme holds for <b>generic</b> systems with <b>additive</b> noise and can be easily implemented numerically, thanks to matrix operations...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{encompasses a}} class of production processes with increasing applications in different areas and supply chains. Due to its flexibility for production in small batches and the versatility of materials and geometries, this technology is recognized as being capable of revolutionizing the production processes as well as changing production strategies that are currently employed. However, there are different technologies under the <b>generic</b> label of <b>additive</b> manufacturing, materials and application areas with different requirements. Given the growing importance of additive manufacturing as a production process, and also considering {{the need to have}} a better insight into the potential applications for driving research and development efforts, this article presents a proposal of organization for additive manufacturing applications in seven areas. Additionally, the article provides a panorama of the current development stage of this technology, with a review of its major technological variants.

40|$|A {{number of}} factors {{relating}} to various methods of repair for chloride initiated corrosion damage of reinforced concrete have been studied. A novel methodology has been developed to facilitate the measurement of macro and micro-cell corrosion rates for steel electrodes embedded in mortar prisms containing a chloride gradient. The galvanic bar specimen comprised electrically isolatable segmental mild steel electrodes and was constructed such that macro-cell corrosion currents were determinable {{for a number of}} electrode combinations. From this, the conditions giving rise to an incipient anode were established. The influence of several reinforcement and substrate primer systems upon macro-cell corrosion, arising from an incipient anode, within a patch repair have been investigated. Measurements of electrochemical noise were made in order to investigate the suitability of the technique as an on-site means of assessing corrosion activity within chloride contaminated reinforced concrete. For this purpose the standard deviation of potential noise was compared to macro-cell galvanic current data and micro-cell corrosion intensity determined by linear polarisation. Hydroxyl ion pore solution analyses were carried out on mortar taken from cathodically protected specimens. These specimens, containing sodium chloride, were cathodically protected over a range of polarisation potentials. Measurement of the hydroxyl ion concentrations were made in order to examine the possibility of alkali-silica reactions initiated by cathodic protection of reinfored concrete. A range of mortars containing a variety of <b>generic</b> type <b>additives</b> were examined in order to establish their resistances to chloride ion diffusion. The effect of surfactant addition rate was investigated within a cement paste containing various dosages of naphthalene sulphonate...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing of anatomically shaped {{scaffolds}} for bonе tissue recovery as well {{as other}} similar anatomically shaped implants represents a major challenge for modern manufacturing technologies. The complexity of anatomically shaped lattice scaffolds for bone tissue recovery requires involvement of so-called additive manufacturing processes. This paper brings out the criterial matrix for the assessment of additive manufacturing processes applicability in the case of bone tissue scaffold manufacturing. Moreover, this criterial matrix serves as the basis for developing Calculator for the <b>generic</b> assessment of <b>additive</b> manufacturing processes applicability. In this very particular case the subject of consideration is an anatomically shaped lattice scaffold intended for the recovery of large trauma located in the upper part of proximal diaphyseal of rabbit tibia. The criterial matrix and the Calculator defined for this case prove themselves as generic tools for comparative analyses of applicability of different additive manufacturing processes. Furthermore, these tools can help identifying the most demanded features of some future additive manufacturing process that has to be developed for the specific case...|$|R
40|$|As it {{is known}} that a wider use of {{biodiesel}} as an alternative fuel. However, a higher viscosity when used at low temperatures, it is feared that the use of biodiesel may exhibit characteristics of different viscosity-temperature which can result in fuel injection pressure is higher at low temperature engine operation. The solution to this problem is the mixing of additives and blending of biodiesel and biodiesel and diesel. This study presents data for the viscosity of biodiesel mixed with <b>generic</b> and commercial <b>additives</b> with concentrations: 0. 0; 0. 25, 0. 5 0. 75; 1. 0, and 1. 25 vol% and a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel with concentration: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 %. Biodiesel mixture is cooled starting temperature of 40 °C to 0 °C with a period of 5 °C. Test results showed that the higher viscosity of pure biodiesel can be derived by mixing the additives and blending of biodiesel and biodiesel and diesel. Mixing behavior and mixing biodiesel with diesel fuel with biodiesel additives can lower the viscosity that is similar to the properties owned diesel fuel allow temperatures.

40|$|Rapid Prototyping, Rapid Manufacturing, Solid Freeform Fabrication, 3 D printing, Layered Manufacturing, etc. are all {{names for}} the {{production}} technologies that currently are grouped in the <b>generic</b> name <b>Additive</b> Manufacturing (AM). The first AM-processes were limited {{to the production of}} visual prototypes for product developers and engineers to understand the shape of the design before it went into series production. Thanks to the improvement in print resolution, dimensional accuracy and material properties, AM is nowadays used for the production of single or small series of functional mechanical products in plastics, metals or ceramics with a high added value. As of now most AM products only fulfill mechanical requirements, and there are {{only a limited number of}} cases where AM is used for electronics production. It is most likely that the next trend will be adding electric, electronic or sensing properties to AM products. In this manner key benefits of AM like: fast CAD to physical part transfer and design freedom, can be extrapolated from mechanic parts to electronics production. Since adding these new properties to AM products is at an early stage, different research groups all over the world are trying to solve this problem at different levels, e. g. at: process level, material level, software level, etc [...] Even open source 3 D print communities are trying to print circuitries, hoping one day the 3 D printer will be able to reconstruct all of its parts including the electronics. A probable solution for giving multifunctional properties (electro-mechanical, electro-thermal, …) to AM products is by combining different AM technologies, thus creating a hybrid AM process. By combining different AM processes multi-material products can be produced, integrating non-conductive, conductive and semi-conductive materials into one product ideally manufactured in one production process. Some possible applications for hybrid AM are embedded sensors, antennas or RFiD tags into freefrom products. At the research group of the Catholic University of Leuven (K. U. Leuven) – campus De Nayer attempts have been made to combine Aerosol Jet® Printing (AJP) with Fused Deposition ModelingTM (FDM®) and combining AJP with Stereo Lithography (SL). Both FDM and SL are well established and robust manufacturing technologies for the production of plastic components. AJP On the other hand is a relatively new technology and is mostly used for the printing of conductive inks. The reason why these combinations of technologies were selected, is because it is possible to integrate AJP and FDM or AJP and SL onto one machine. The direct AJP of silver ink on FDM and SL substrates also indicates that it is possible to combine these technologies on a processing level. Undoubtedly it will be possible to print a product with multifunctional properties in the near future. However further investigation in combining AM technologies is required, leading to the construction new hybrid manufacturing machines. Furthermore to support hybrid AM software applications and design rules for developing multifunctional AM products needs to be developed. status: publishe...|$|R
