40|$|Abstract CLA 2000 Cooking Liquor Analyzer gives on-line {{information}} on cooking reactions during a cook. Alkali, {{total dissolved solids}} and lignin contents are measured during individual cooks in a batch <b>digester</b> <b>house</b> and from several circulations in a continuous digester. Mill trials show good correlations between CLA 2000 measurements and laboratory analyses. Using these measurements {{it is possible to}} predict kappa number values {{before the end of the}} cook in a batch digester or to alter cooking conditions in a continuous digester to obtain desired kappa number. In addition to kappa number prediction CLA 2000 can be utilised in alkali dosage and residual alkali control...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent dynamic {{simulator}} {{has been}} developed with linguistic equations (LE) for a SuperBatch coking process. The LE models consist of two parts: interactions are handled with linear equa-tions, and nonlinearities {{are taken into account}} by scaling with membership denitions. Data-driven modelling was done by FuzzEqu toolbox {{on the basis of the}} measurements of the cooking liquor analyser CLA 2000 : the concentrations of alkali, total dissolved solids and lignin are measured on-line during individual cooks in a batch <b>digester</b> <b>house.</b> According to extensive on-line tests in an industrial pulp mill, dynamic LE models are well suited for forecasting the cooking result: residual alkali, lignin and dissolved solids. The models are adapted to the changing operating conditions with con gurable parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|In the Pulp and Paper mill Industry, <b>Digester</b> <b>house</b> is {{the main}} section and {{corrosion}} {{is a big problem}} in this section. The presence of sulfate, sulfide, and chloride in liquor and Silicone in steel produce the severe corrosion problem in digester. An In plant test of six month duration was done in the bottom part of a batch digester, made of mild steel of volume 85 m 3. The wood chips are filled in the digester and cooking liquor is then charged keeping liquor to wood ratio as 1 : 2. 8. Volume of cooking liquor inside the digester was kept between 37 to 42 m 3. The cooking liquor consists of mainly sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (92 gpl as NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) (22. 4 gpl as NaOH) having pH ~ 13. 2. Maximum temperature attained during the pulping process is 168 0 C and it operates at a pressure of 6. 2 Kg/Cm 2. The results showed that mild steel (MS) experiences highest corrosion rate while Duplex stainless steels experienced least corrosion rate. It is concluded that the bottom part of the digester is affected due to erosion as well as localized assisted corrosion and the bottom part can be constructed of duplex stainless steel without severe risk of corrosion...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} whether workers in Swedish sulfate mills {{have an increased}} risk of death from certain malignancies that have previously been linked to the pulping process.  METHODS—Subjects of the study (n= 2480) were men aged 40 - 75 at death during 1960 - 89 in the parishes surrounding four sulfate mills. Exposure assessment was based on information from the personnel files in the mills— 35 % of the subjects were recognised there, and work categories were created.  RESULTS—Among all sulfate mill workers, the odds ratio (OR) (90 % confidence interval (90 % CI)) for death from lung cancer was 1. 6  (1. 1  to 2. 3), pleural mesotheliomas 9. 5  (1. 9  to 48), brain tumours 2. 6  (1. 2  to 5. 3), and liver or biliary tract cancer 2. 3  (1. 0  to 5. 2). There was an increased mortality from leukaemia among workers in the soda recovery plant (5. 9  (2. 6  to 13)) and bleaching plant and <b>digester</b> <b>house</b> (2. 8  (1. 0  to 7. 5)).  CONCLUSIONS—Sulfate mill workers were at increased risk of dying from lung cancer and pleural mesotheliomas, probably due to exposure to asbestos. Increased risks of brain tumours and cancers of the liver or biliary tract were also found but the aetiology is not obvious.    Keywords: epidemiology; pulp and paper industry; brain neoplas...|$|E
