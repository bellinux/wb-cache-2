Patients need to perform self-care to handle their symptoms, but knowledge {{about what kind of}} self-care patients do is limited and these individuals {{need to learn how to}} manage the symptoms that arise. The aim of this study was to explore self-care among patients with IBD. Twenty adult patients with IBD, 25 – 66 years of age, were interviewed. Data were analyzed by performing a qualitative content analysis. Four categories with 10 subcategories emerged from the analysis of the interviews. The self-care patients perform consists of symptom recognition (subcategories: physiological sensations and psychological sensations), handling of symptoms (subcategories: adapting the diet, using medical treatment, stress management, and using complementary alternative medicine), planning life (subcategories: planning for when to do activities and when to refrain from activities), and seeking new options (subcategories: seeking knowledge and personal contacts). Self-care consists of symptom recognition, <b>handling</b> <b>life</b> through planning, and accommodating the existing situation with the ultimate goal of maintaining well-being.

40|$|Abstract Background In family {{practice}} depression {{is a common}} mental health problem and one with marked gender differences; women are diagnosed as depressed twice as often as men. A more comprehensive explanatory model of depression that can give an understanding of, and tools for changing, this gender difference is called for. This study explores how primary care patients experience, understand and explain their depression. Methods Twenty {{men and women of}} varying ages and socioeconomic backgrounds diagnosed with depression according to ICD- 10 were interviewed in-depth. Data were assessed and analyzed using Grounded Theory. Results The core category that emerged from analysis was "Gendered trajectories into depression". Thereto, four categories were identified – "Struck by lightning", "Nagging darkness", "Blackout" and "Slowly suffocating" – and presented as symbolic illness narratives that showed gendered patterns. Most of the men in our study considered that their bodies were suddenly "struck" by external circumstances beyond their control. The stories of study women were more diverse, reflecting all four illness narratives. However, the dominant pattern was that women thought that their depression emanated from internal factors, from their own personality or ways of <b>handling</b> <b>life.</b> The women were more preoccupied with shame and guilt, and conveyed a greater sense of personal responsibility and concern with relationships. Conclusion Recognizing gendered narratives of illness in clinical consultation may have a salutary potential, making more visible depression among men while relieving self-blame among women, and thereby encouraging the development of healthier practices of how to be a man or a woman. </p...|$|E
