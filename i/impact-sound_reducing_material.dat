40|$|To {{develop a}} {{high-performance}} shrinkage reducing agent, {{this study investigated}} several shrinkage <b>reducing</b> <b>materials</b> and supplements for those materials. Fluidity and air content were satisfactory for the various shrinkage <b>reducing</b> <b>materials.</b> The decrease in viscosity was the lowest for glycol-based materials. The decrease in drying shrinkage was most prominent for mixtures containing glycol-based materials.

Most shrinkage <b>reducing</b> <b>materials</b> had weaker level of compressive strength than that of the plain mixture. When 3 % triethanolamine was used for early strength improvement, the strength was enhanced by 158 % compared to that of the plain mixture on day 1; enhancement values were 135 % on day 7 and 113 % on day 28. To assess the performance of the developed high-performance shrinkage reducing agent and to determine the optimal amount, 2. 0 % shrinkage reducing agent was set as 40 % {{of the value of the}} plain mixture.

Result showed that transportation length has a big influence on environmental impact. Thus, an efficient logistics can be a key in reducing environmental impact.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to material handling wastes. These sub-optimal material handling systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> handling wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. Material handling wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate material handling, b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} <b>reduce</b> <b>material</b> handling wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three material handling wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> handling wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc material handling system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises. The resulting methodology is expected to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in <b>reducing</b> in-house <b>material</b> handling wastes using visual management systems...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify nine different eco-innovation activities – including such items as <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> use per unit of output, reducing energy use per unit of output, reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2) “footprint” – and the authors ask whether these act as substitutes or complements to one another. Design/methodology/approach: Eco-innovation is {{any form of}} product, process or organisational innovation that contributes towards sustainable development. Firms can eco-innovate in a variety of ways. In this paper the authors identify nine different eco-innovation activities – including such items as <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> use per unit of output, reducing energy use per unit of output, reducing CO 2 “footprint” – and the authors ask whether these act as substitutes or complements to one another. Findings: Introducing only one eco-innovation activity has little payoff (in terms of turnover per worker) with only those firms who reduce their CO 2 “footprint” having higher levels of turnover per worker. When introducing more than one eco-innovation activity the authors find that certain eco-innovation activities complement one another (e. g. <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> use within the firm at the same time as improving the ability to recycle the product after use) others act as substitutes (e. g. <b>reducing</b> <b>material</b> use within the firm at the same time as recycling waste, water or materials within the firm). Practical implications: The results suggest that firms can maximise their productive capacity by considering specific combinations of eco-innovation. This suggests that firms should plan to introduce eco-innovation which act as complements, thereby, boosting productivity. It also suggests that eco-innovation stimuli, introduced by policy makers, should be targeted at complementary eco-innovations. Originality/value: The paper analyses whether eco-innovations act as complements or substitutes. While a number of studies have analysed the importance of eco-innovation for firm performance, few have assessed the extent to which diverse types of eco-innovation interact with each other to complement or substitute for one another...|$|R
