5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley <b>Erectors</b> Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple <b>Erectors.</b> Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's big three and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} such as more restriction conditions, complicated interference and longer design periods in the design process of segment <b>erector</b> for Tunnel Boring Machine, it is necessary to study on the kinematics simulation of TBM segment <b>erector.</b> First of all, the kinematics characteristics of segment <b>erector</b> are analyzed; the 3 -D model is designed in Pro/E environment; the model is imported into ADAMS and the dynamic simulation is finished finally. After the analysis of simulation of this mechanism, the curves of the speed for the driving parts are obtained and the maximum speeds of driving parts are identified with the method of space search technology. The kinematics characteristics of TBM segment <b>erector</b> are obtained. The simulation results provide an important reference for the mechanism design and type selection design for the power system and design cycle is shortened for TBM segment <b>erector...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Iron Workers had {{successfully}} repelled the open shop demands of American Bridge Company (or [...] "Ambridge"), {{an arm of}} the United States Steel Corporation, in 1903. In 1905, after the union's collective bargaining agreement with Ambridge had expired, Ambridge and {{the other members of the}} National <b>Erectors</b> Association began refusing to hire union members and hired labor spies to infiltrate the union. When the Iron Workers struck in response, the employers obtained injunctions and local ordinances that barred picketing or limited it to an ineffective display. Open shop demands still exist today. Non-union iron working outfits (companies) are in competition to take over union jobs, but the non-union rate (i.e., hourly wage) is based off the union rate.|$|E
2500|$|In Cornwall at {{that time}} {{there were a number}} of engine <b>erectors</b> {{competing}} with each other, each with different technical methods of achieving the same ends. As a result, a great deal of copying of mechanical innovations and violation of patents went on, often through the reporting of casual conversations between engineers and practical observations of engine modifications. The risk of his patents being infringed was something which particularly exercised Watt, and so Murdoch was, in addition to his other activities, called upon to make reports and swear out affidavits for legal actions against Boulton & Watt's competitors. In the close knit and clannish Cornwall of the time this was sometimes at his own risk. As one of his colleagues stated to Watt: ...|$|E

40|$|The lumbar <b>erector</b> spinae {{consists}} of two muscles iliocostaiis lumborum and longissimus thoracis each with distinct thoracic and lumbar parts. The thoracic parts consist of tiny muscle bellies with segmental origins from the thorax and long caudal tendons that form the <b>erector</b> spinae aponeurosis. The lumbar fibers arise from the lumbar accessory processes and the L 1 - 4 transverse processes, and insert independently of the <b>erector</b> spinae aponeurosis into the ilium.

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that the sagittal plane moment arm of the <b>erector</b> spinae decreases at the Ls/S 1 level during torso flexion.

Nineteen male subjects lifted three loads from two origin locations to an upright neutral posture. Spinal loading was predicted from an EMG-assisted biomechanical model that allowed the <b>erector</b> spinae moment arm to vary during torso flexion. The predicted lateral, anterior-posterior shear and compression forces increased by 7. 4 %, 11. 1 % and 6. 6 %, respectively, when compared to using a biomechanical model that kept the <b>erector</b> spinae moment arm constant. These results suggest that models that account for the varying <b>erector</b> spinae moment arm predict greater spinal loads, especially for motions that involve a large degree of torso flexion...|$|R

The activities of {{the internal and external}} abdominal oblique, rectus abdominal,multifidus and thoracic and lumbar <b>erector</b> spinae muscles were measured using surface electromyography. Unexpected and expected perturbations were applied to the trunk by sudden loading. The subject was instructed to maintain his initial standing position. The results showed that the activation of the multifidus and lumbar and thoracic <b>erector</b> spinae muscles was increased significantly more in the expected condition than in the unexpected condition in anticipation of postural adjustment. The activation of the multifidus and lumbar <b>erector</b> spinae muscles was increased significantly more than 150 msec before the perturbations,while that of the thoracic <b>erector</b> spinae muscles was increased significantly, 50 msec before the perturbations. The increased activation of the multifidus and lumbar <b>erector</b> spinae muscles appears to be a mechanism designed to improve the stability of the trunk through stiffening of the entire segment during forward loading...|$|R
