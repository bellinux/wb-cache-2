This research conducted on 80 stocks listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange 2008 to 2012 period.

5|$|The island's lush vegetation, {{a product}} of its mild climate and {{frequent}} rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few <b>extremes.</b> The climate is typically insular and is temperate avoiding the <b>extremes</b> in temperature of many other areas {{in the world at}} similar latitudes.

50|$|Adam Ryland {{originally}} developed <b>Extreme</b> Warfare as a collectible card {{game with a}} wrestling theme. Due to complexity and set up time it was decided a computer format would be more suitable. The first <b>Extreme</b> Warfare on the PC (now called <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 1) was programmed in 1995 in QBasic. This game was a simple simulator, where one could decide what matches were to take place and {{who was going to}} win them but also involved some simple financial elements, such as the wages of wrestlers. Due to limitations in QBasic, Ryland moved the series over to Turbo Pascal where further incarnations of the game were created, including: <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 2, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 2000, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 2001, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 2002, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 5000, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 6000, <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 7500, and <b>Extreme</b> Warfare 9000.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of <b>extreme</b> input stimuli in brainstorming. <b>Extreme</b> stimuli contain unfamiliar, ambiguous, critical and or provocative elements. The instrumental use of <b>extreme</b> input has only recently been investigated as a promising technique in ideation to get participants to think beyond the already known. It is not clear, though, which <b>extreme</b> mechanisms {{are most likely to}} trigger creativity. To investigate this, four brainstorm sessions were organized, of which three relied on <b>extreme</b> input stimuli: <b>Extreme</b> Ideas, <b>Extreme</b> Characters and <b>Extreme</b> Personas. The fourth session did not employ <b>extreme</b> input. Four experts assessed the output via a creative-idea-count. The preliminary results suggest that using <b>Extreme</b> Ideas as input for brainstorming in the early ideation phase leads to more original ideas than employing Non-Extreme Ideas. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Between the <b>extremes</b> of {{bicycles}} with classical {{front-wheel steering}} {{and those with}} strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at <b>extremes</b> of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, <b>extremes</b> of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
