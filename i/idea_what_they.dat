5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
25|$|The {{woman who}} found Kovari's {{body in a}} Churchyard in Barking, found Daniel Whitworth's body just 2 weeks later in {{almost exactly the same}} position. She {{reported}} thinking these circumstances are clearly suspicious and that Dagenham Police 'had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing' to not be able to connect the two cases, despite the bodies being found in exactly the same locations and positions.|$|E

60|$|They {{must have}} some idea of it. Otherwise they must be imposters. I am loth to believe them imposters, mere adventurers who have blundered into {{positions}} of power and honour with no <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing to the world. But if they have an <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing to the world, they foresee and intend a Future. That, I take it, is sound reasoning and the inference is plain.|$|R

25|$|For a fission {{weapon to}} operate, {{there must be}} {{sufficient}} fissile material to support a chain reaction, a critical mass. To separate the fissile uranium-235 isotope from the non-fissile uranium-238, two methods were developed which {{took advantage of the}} fact that uranium-238 has a slightly greater atomic mass: electromagnetic separation and gaseous diffusion. Another secret site was erected at rural Oak Ridge, Tennessee, for the large-scale production and purification of the rare isotope, which required considerable investment. At the time, K-25, one of the Oak Ridge facilities, was the world's largest factory under one roof. The Oak Ridge site employed {{tens of thousands of people}} at its peak, most of whom had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were working on.|$|E
500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only {{a few months after the}} song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when I was living in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or {{on the issues of}} Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.|$|E

60|$|To this {{question}} the Indian gravely replied {{in his own}} language (with which the trappers were well acquainted), that, not having the remotest <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were talking about, he entertained no opinion in regard to it whatever.|$|R
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received very mixed reviews, {{with the}} artificial intelligence universally derided and other gameplay elements garnering {{a range of}} opinions. Bozon said that [...] "the A.I. {{can be a real}} pain, as characters often take extremely odd routes to destinations or show command issues when engaging enemies", Joe Juba of Game Informer called the pathfinding [...] "laughably terrible", a criticism echoed by Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com, and Parkin called it [...] "an unmitigated disaster". VanOrd termed it [...] "the worst, most broken system of unit pathfinding ever devised", and Gann felt it was so bad that it showed that the developers [...] "had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing" [...] in making an RTS. Bozon felt that the overall real-time strategy gameplay, however, was deep, if a bit slow, as did VanOrd. Parkin felt that the gameplay was [...] "easy and intuitive", though slow, while Parish felt that the limitations of the Nintendo DS's small screens made the game too streamlined for an RTS game. Juba and the GamePro reviewer felt that the restrictions necessary to fit an RTS on a system the size of the DS made the game too simple and easy. The Japanese Famitsu review, however, felt that the game worked well as an RTS for the Nintendo DS, and was well-suited to the console. Both Bozon and Parish felt that the local multiplayer was better than the single-player game, though Bozon felt that the lack of online multiplayer was stifling and VanOrd felt that the tie between the multiplayer game and the player's single-player progress imbalanced any game where both players had not fully completed the storyline.|$|E

2500|$|When Radio London {{closed down}} on 14 August 1967, John Peel joined the BBC's new pop music station, BBC Radio 1, which began {{broadcasting}} the following month. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 {{was not a}} full-time station, but a hybrid of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel recalled, [...] "I {{was one of the}} first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else." [...] Peel presented a programme called Top Gear. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of Top Gear; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975. Peel played an eclectic mix of the music that caught his attention, which he would continue to do throughout his career.|$|E
50|$|The show also {{features}} subliminally parodied of Pope Benedict XVI by supplanting his image {{with one of}} Nosferatu—long enough to be noticed, but not {{long enough for the}} viewer to have a concrete <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had just seen.|$|R
50|$|Users {{found the}} Tomsradio.com {{interface}} a bit difficult to navigate.

50|$|In {{the first}} phase of the competition, {{participants}} were required to complete an application form describing an <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> intent to develop on a 30cmx30cm canvas or paper.

2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking me right now for 'conspiracy theories' have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are talking about ... people who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} how Dir en Grey have gained a {{significant}} international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said [...] "when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English and I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were saying. But I {{still remember the}} excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music {{in the same way}} — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{mentioned}} that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, designedly sealed with large boulders nearly 2000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance. A vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel: it goes 14 meters deep, and the entrance leads to a nearly 100 meters long corridor that ends {{in a series of}} underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced a painstaking pace very slowly and carefully. Excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock jade and quartz, elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of metallized spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimetres, the balls have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow jarosite formed by the oxidation of pyrite. According to George Cowgill from Arizona State University the spheres are a fascinating find, [...] "Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean." [...] All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.|$|E
