Twenty acres were dedicated to pasture, half an acre for gardening/orchard, eight for wheat, two acres for potatoes and around 60 acres for hay. The land also had one house, two barns, three carriages, four carts, six ploughs one reaper, one horse rack and one <b>fanning</b> <b>mill.</b> That year the crop yields consisted of 75 bushels of wheat, 150 bushels of barley, 300 bushels of oats, five bushels of beans, 200 bushels of potatoes, 40 bushels of turnips, 10 bushels of beets, 35 bushels of carrots, six bushels of pears/plums and 80 tons of hay. The livestock on the land consisted of nine horses/colts, eight milk cows, 13 cattle, 18 sheep, 13 swine and three beehives.

50|$|When seed {{is first}} {{separated}} from cones it {{is mixed with}} foreign matter, often 2 to 5 times {{the volume of the}} seed. The more or less firmly attached membranous wings on the seed must be detached before it is cleaned of foreign matter. The testa must not incur damage during the dewinging process. Two methods have been used, dry and wet. Dry seed may be rubbed gently through a sieve that has a mesh through which only seed without wings can pass. Large quantities of seed can be processed in dewinging machines, which use cylinders of heavy wire mesh and rapidly revolving stiff brushes within to remove the wings. In the wet process, seed with wings attached are spread out 10 cm to 15 cm deep on a tight floor and slightly moistened throughout; light leather flails are used to free seed from the wings. Wang (1973) described a unique wet dewinging procedure using a cement mixer, used at the Petawawa tree seed processing facility. Wings of white and Norway spruce seed can be removed by dampening the seed slightly before it is run through a <b>fanning</b> <b>mill</b> for the last time. Any moistened seed must be dried before fermentation or moulding sets in.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPulverizing system {{equipped}} by <b>fan</b> <b>mills</b> uses “three medium” (ie. low-temperature furnace smoke, high-temperature furnace smoke, hot air) for drying coal, {{especially in}} large-scale plants burning lignite. A constantly increasing unit capacity {{leads to a}} more complicated design for pulverizing system, with a heavier weight of furnace smoke tube. This paper focuses on a research of water-cooled membrane flue tube instead of traditional inner and outer insulation tube through experiments like changing water side parameters to replace the low-temperature flue pipe from “three medium” to “two medium” (ie. adjustable-temperature furnace smoke, hot air). This paper studies heat transfer coefficient of water-cooled furnace smoke pipe at different flow rate and flue gas temperature though a established water-cooled furnace smoke pipe test bed. It is using a certain mathematic method to obtain dimensionless relationship among Nu, Re, Pr and obtain the dimensionless rule equation of water-cooled furnace smoke tube...|$|R
