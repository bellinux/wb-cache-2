50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because drum hoists do not have tail ropes, the <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|E

40|$|Storage {{space in}} sport and {{competitive}} rowing sheds is limited. The use of racking is common to improve the utilisation of available floor space. This project aims to develop a <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> suitable for the vertical storage of the small boats (tinnies) that are used for coaching and other functions in the sport. A search of available boat hoists revealed numerous manufactures and designs mainly in the United States. It seems the American people use boat hoists {{in the same way}} as we use boat trailers in Australia. These existing hoist products are used for out of water storage of small boats and are usually mounted lake side or attached to a wharf structure. None of the hoists located are capable of storing more than one boat vertically. A new type of hoist will be required. Due to the time available for the design work this project has focused on researching hoist requirements and design and is restricted to the <b>hoisting</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> is an integral part of the overall hoist structure therefore some preliminary design work of the hoist structure has also be undertaken.

40|$|The dynamic {{responses}} of parallel <b>hoisting</b> <b>system</b> with time-varying length and rigid guidance under drive deviation are investigated considering tension and torsion {{characteristics of the}} ropes. The variable-domain three-node elements of rope are employed and the corresponding differential algebraic equations (DAEs) are derived using Lagrange’s equations of the first kind. The slack situation of the rope is considered, and the dynamic equations which are systems of DAEs are transformed to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The dynamic {{responses of}} tension, torsion, and acceleration are analyzed considering radius’ error of the drums, which indicates that the drive deviation between ropes can cause large influence on the tension difference and even cause one of the ropes to slack.
