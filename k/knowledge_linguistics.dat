40|$|Consumers often share experiences, {{opinions}} {{or certain}} content with others. For example, they suggest restaurants, recommend article posts, share online videos, pass along rumors and complain about customer services. Such {{word of mouth}} determines what catches on and become popular among consumers. While {{research has shown that}} word of mouth is frequent and important, there has been limited work on understanding what makes certain content more shared than others. This dissertation fills this gap, and explores the psychological drivers that shape consumer information sharing and more broadly cultural success. It integrates various research perspectives and illustrates certain characteristics that make people share some content more than others. First, we study how self-relevance (i. e., high vs. low) impact sharing behavior of product harm information, and this process is moderated by consumer self-construal (independent vs. interdependent). Second, we examine how advertising content can get viral, and how and when this benefits the brand. Finally, we explore how phrases that relate to senses in metaphoric ways (e. g., cold person) lead to higher recall, which contributes their cultural success over time. The practical implications of this dissertation are of interest for professionals in the area of marketing, advertising, and public policy making. From a theoretical point of view, this dissertation has a cross-disciplinary contribution, and relates to the fields of health psychology, advertising, persuasion <b>knowledge,</b> <b>linguistics,</b> embodied cognition and foundations of culture...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{describing}} {{an approach}} meant {{to build a}} sign adapted to acousmatic music and based on reduced listening. The sign, to be efficient, must obey to {{a certain number of}} requisits: precision, ergonomy, relevance [...] . It must be both easy to use and able to create relations between sounds. A simple description of their qualities is not enough: it must be able to create or analyse sound compositions and structures, such as instrumental scores. To fulfill this purpose, it must be able to give each sound a value, in a saussurian meaning of the word. I will try to show the genealogy of my sign, how I took elements of reflexion from musical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>linguistics,</b> semiotics and aesthetics. From there I deduced the concept of minimal unit of sound applied to electroacoustic music and I created a sign combining symbols to decribe its features. I'll show how I have reorganised sound paramaters described by Schaeffer and how this sign works. At last, I will show the possibilities of writing scores sound by sound and I'll show two kinds of analysis: the analysis of a pure acousmatic work from a formal point of view and the analysis of a work for tape and instruments both from a formal and a symbolic point of view...|$|E
40|$|The {{reason for}} this thesis was the {{development}} of the digital learning environment Cleio (TalenTransit) from 2004 to 2007. In a broader approach, this study focuses on the demands of digital learning environments for foreign language learning and teaching at universities and colleges from the perspectives of the sociology of <b>knowledge,</b> <b>linguistics,</b> language learning theory and educational linguistics. The theoretical approach, which is based on literature review, aims to reveal the parallels and provides coherence between these perspectives. Based on the results and conclusions, it can be stated that the socio-constructivist concept of communicative genres can be applied to constitute the central curricular and didactic organization of foreign language teaching and learning. Communicative genres are understood as curricular modules, which can establish the knowledge structure of the Common European Framework of Reference and which can be realized on micro level by assignments (tasks). Our research reveals that digital learning environments do not follow a language learning concept. To facilitate this construction of learning environments, various concepts, developed in the context of Cleio, are proposed and discussed on the basis of theoretical approaches. The task and exercise structure is operationalized with a task manager, a tool for composing learning units. It is suggested that such instruments can support teachers in their development and application of coherent didactic scenarios. Further {{results of this study suggest}} that theoretical concepts can be understood as genres and therefore should be analaysed in such a structured way. In the opinionof the author, this leads to an enhanced coherence of the theoretical discourse and also increased accessibility of theoretical insights for teacher...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{article focuses}} on a recent study that {{investigated}} perceptions of regular and special educa-tors working with multicultural {{students with and without}} disabilities throughout the State of Kansas. The Multicultural Special Education Survey was distributed to 403 general and special educators who repre-sented geographical areas, as well as school districts with an enrollment equal to or greater than 10 percent. This instrument consisted of items related to categories of demographics, professional development, cultural <b>knowledge,</b> <b>linguistics,</b> and teaching strategies. In the area of professional development, the most notewor-thy and frequently cited response was "no training " in multicultural education course work. The highest percentage of respondents reported that cultural knowledge would help them understand the influence of their students ’ verbal and nonverbal learning/behavioral styles. The highest percentage of respondents reported that knowledge about the language of multicultural students and child language development were the most important areas of training. Respondents indicated that teacher-student discussion, cooperative learning, and peer tutoring were useful teaching strategies with multicultural students with and without dis-abilities. These results are discussed relative to the knowledge base of general and special educators and the future direction of teacher preparation programs. hue emerging demographics of the U. S. and the field of special education can no longer be perceived as unrelated or isolated from each other. For example, by the year 2000, non-Europeans such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will comprise one-third of the U. S. population. Of these groups, 30 million African Americans and 20 million Hispanic Americans will comprise almost a third of the total school enrollment.
