40|$|Immunization {{of adult}} macaques with live {{attenuated}} simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) lacking the nef genes {{has been shown}} to protect against challenge with full-length pathogenic SIV. To test live attenuated virus vaccines {{for the first time in}} a natural host we have constructed a mutant SIV from African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> (SIVagm) with a deletion of 125 bp in the nef gene (SIVagm 3 Δnef). This mutant showed moderately delayed in vitro replication in the T cell line MOLT- 4 / 8 and in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Cercopithecus aetiops) and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) compared with cloned wild-type SIVagm 3. In contrast, in vivo replication of SIVagm 3 Δnef in African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> was severely impaired or undetectable and did not induce seroconversion. After challenge with wild-type SIVagm 3 the SIVagm 3 Δnef preinoculated African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> showed a memory antibody response that declined after week 2. In three of four African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> the cell-associated virus load and in two of four African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> the plasma virus load was dramatically decreased after the challenge compared with naive control animals. The remaining animal showed no evidence of productive challenge virus replication. This study demonstrates that a strong vaccine effect or protection in the SIVagm/African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> system is possible using a live attenuated vaccine in the absence of a productive infection and corresponding humoral immune response...|$|R

Although both the cell line BS-C- 1 and primary African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> kidney cultures produced useful amounts of virus, HAV was detected earlier and in greater quantities in primary African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> kidney cultures. A persistently infected primary African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> kidney culture was developed. The influence of incubation time (4 to 40 days) and concentration (2 to 15 %) of {{fetal calf serum}} in the maintenance medium on production of HAV by this culture was examined. An incubation period of 24 to 28 days {{was found to be}} optimal; reducing this period led to decreased yields of HAV. No significant difference in the amount of HAV produced was observed with differing concentrations of fetal calf serum. Three different methods of extraction and the effect of multiple extractions on the recovery of HAV from cell lysates were examined. Sonication was a critical factor. Two extractions yielded more than 90 % recoverable virus. Yields in excess of 10 (11) physical particles of HAV per 850 -cm 2 roller bottle were routine. The total yield could be increased by concentrating the HAV present in spent maintenance medium by using bentonite or organic flocculation...|$|R

An antibody response was first observed 10 days and 5 days after inoculation of cynomolgus <b>monkeys</b> and African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys,</b> respectively, and was detectable {{for the duration}} of the experiment (33 days). HHV- 6 DNA was first detected by the polymerase chain reaction in mononuclear cells of one cynomolgus monkey and one African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> 10 days after virus inoculation, and in a total of three of four cynomolgus monkeys (75 %) and four of five African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> (80 %) later after inoculation. Furthermore, HHV- 6 DNA was detected in the lymph nodes and spleen of monkeys killed 33 days after virus inoculation. A rash was observed on the trunk of one African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> 13 days after virus inoculation, otherwise the infection was asymptomatic. When mononuclear cells from both groups of monkeys were cultured in medium contain-ing concanavalin A and interleukin 2, and infected with HHV- 6 in vitro, virus replication was observed. The data suggest that HHV- 6 infects these species of monkey and that this system could be useful as an animal model of HHV- 6 infection...|$|R

40|$|The prevalence, natural history, {{and genetic}} {{characteristics}} of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections in most feral African monkey species are presently unknown, yet {{this information is}} essential to elucidate their origin and relationship to other simian and human immunodeficiency viruses. In this study, a combination of classical and molecular approaches were used to identify and characterize SIV isolates from West African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> (Cercopithecus sabaeus) (SIVagm isolates). Four SIVagm viruses from wild-caught West African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> were isolated and analyzed biologically and molecularly. Amplification, cloning, and sequencing of a 279 -bp polymerase fragment directly from uncultured {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was facilitated by the use of nested polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that West African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> are naturally infected with SIVs which are closely related to East African SIVagm isolates. However, structural, antigenic, and genetic differences were observed which strongly suggest that the West African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> viruses comprise a phylogenetically distinct subgroup of SIVagm. These findings support our previous hypothesis that SIVagm viruses may have evolved and diverged coincident with the evolution and divergence of their African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> host. In addition, this study describes a polymerase chain reaction-based approach that allows the identification and molecular analysis of divergent SIV strains directly from primary monkey tissue. This approach, which does not depend on virus isolation methods, should facilitate future studies aimed at elucidating the origins and natural history of SIVs in feral African <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> populations...|$|R
