5|$|<b>Ferrite,</b> {{a type of}} {{sintered}} ceramic {{composed of}} Iron Oxide (Fe2O3) and barium oxide (BaO), is both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, and can be temporarily or permanently magnetized.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the <b>ferrite</b> phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called <b>ferrite</b> with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, <b>ferrite</b> and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), <b>ferrite</b> will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of <b>ferrite</b> were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the <b>ferrite</b> had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some <b>ferrite</b> (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>ferrites</b> have {{hexagonal}} crystal structure, like barium and strontium <b>ferrites</b> BaFe12O19 (BaO:6Fe2O3) and SrFe12O19 (SrO:6Fe2O3).|$|R
40|$|When highly divided spinel <b>ferrites</b> become {{reactive}} {{enough with}} oxygen, {{to allow the}} oxidation of the Fe 2 + ions at low temperature and of substitute cations too, when these cations are capable of different valence states. We prepared fine particles of spinel <b>ferrites</b> substituted by Mn, Mo, Cu, by "chimie douce", especially from oxalate precursors and used them to reveal and to study the oxido-reduction phenomena occurring in these finely divided materials. It was shown that the oxidation created a new family of spinel <b>ferrites</b> : the mixed-valence defect <b>ferrites,</b> having specific characteristics and properties. The <b>ferrites</b> of this type can be fine powders prepared at low temperature, or ground <b>ferrites</b> obtained at high temperature, or thin films...|$|R

5|$|<b>Ferrite</b> (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining <b>ferrite,</b> with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{magnetostrictive}} {{materials used}} for the transducer are either <b>ferrite</b> or compressed powdered iron. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be {{used for the}} input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of eddy currents, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.|$|E
40|$|The NiCd <b>ferrites</b> with Fe excess in {{comparison}} with stoichiometry composition and with Fe excess amount substituting by Cr, moreover containing small amount of Co are prepared. The formation of preminvar effect and uniaxial induced anisotropy in these <b>ferrites</b> are examined under the heat treatment with and without magnetic field. The appearence of uniaxial induced anisotropy causes unexpected changes of some magnetic and electric properties of <b>ferrites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ni-Cu <b>ferrites</b> of {{different}} compositions were prepared by a conventional double sintering ceramic technique. Electrical conductivity of Ni-Cu <b>ferrites</b> of various compositions {{have been investigated}} from room temperature to well beyond the Curie temperature. Composition and frequency dependent dielectric properties of mixed Ni-Cu <b>ferrites</b> have been measured at room temperature in the frequency range 1 to 13 MHz using a HP 4192 A impedance analyser. Plots of log (�T) versus 10 3 /T are linear and have shown a transition near the Curie temperature. The activation energy in the ferromagnetic region is in general less than that in the paramagnetic region. Plots of dielectric constant (��) versus frequency have shown a normal dielectric behavior of spinel <b>ferrites.</b> The frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent (tan �) {{is found to be}} abnormal, giving a peak at certain frequency for all mixed Ni-Cu <b>ferrites.</b> An attempt is made to explain the conduction mechanism in Ni-Cu <b>ferrites</b> and a qualitative explanation is given for the composition and frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent...|$|R
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a <b>ferrite</b> BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

25|$|After 1980, most (but {{not quite}} all) driver {{manufacturers}} switched from Alnico to <b>ferrite</b> magnets, {{which are made}} from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium <b>ferrite.</b> Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than Alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.|$|E
50|$|Known ferrimagnetic {{materials}} include YIG (yttrium iron garnet), cubic <b>ferrites</b> {{composed of}} iron oxides {{and other elements}} such as aluminum, cobalt, nickel, manganese and zinc, hexagonal <b>ferrites</b> such as PbFe12O19 and BaFe12O19, and pyrrhotite, Fe1−xS.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ferrites</b> {{are usually}} {{non-conductive}} ferrimagnetic ceramic compounds derived from iron oxides such as hematite (Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4) {{as well as}} oxides of other metals. <b>Ferrites</b> are, {{like most of the}} other ceramics, hard and brittle.|$|R
30|$|<b>Ferrites</b> are ferrimagnetic oxides, {{crystallizes}} {{into two}} magnetic sub-lattices, tetrahedral (A) site and octahedral (B) site. The electrical and magnetic properties, upon which their application depends, {{depend upon the}} cation distribution among these two sites. <b>Ferrites</b> are high-resistivity materials with low eddy current losses which make them potential materials for high-frequency applications such as microwave devices. The electrical resistivity of <b>ferrites</b> has been normally found to increase on doping or substituting with other oxides [5].|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a one sided flux magnet is a refrigerator magnet. These are usually composed of powdered <b>ferrite</b> in a binder such as plastic or rubber. The extruded magnet is exposed to a rotating field giving the <b>ferrite</b> particles in the magnetic compound a magnetization resulting in a one-sided flux distribution. This distribution increases the holding force of the magnet when placed on a permeable surface, compared to the holding force from, say, a uniform magnetization of the magnetic compound.|$|E
25|$|Most ferrites are ferrimagnetic. The first {{discovered}} magnetic substance, magnetite, is a <b>ferrite</b> and was originally {{believed to be}} a ferromagnet; Louis Néel disproved this, however, after discovering ferrimagnetism.|$|E

Construction of a <b>ferrite</b> plant started in 1991, but was delayed several times, including changing the technology and replacing the new oven which cracked. It was completed by 1994 and cost NOK43.6million. The company also started pigment production from October 1995.|$|E
25|$|An equally {{important}} {{reason was that}} main memories were quite slow (a common type was <b>ferrite</b> core memory); by using dense information packing, one could reduce {{the frequency with which}} the CPU had to access this slow resource. Modern computers face similar limiting factors: main memories are slow compared to the CPU and the fast cache memories employed to overcome this are limited in size. This may partly explain why highly encoded instruction sets have proven to be as useful as RISC designs in modern computers.|$|E
25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or <b>ferrite</b> loopstick antennas used in modern radios.|$|E
