In 2007, Gaga and Kelly were working with RedOne in a small {{recording}} studio in Queens, New York. Gaga was writing [...] "what would later become" [...] her debut studio album The Fame (2008) and Kelly was writing songs with RedOne to pitch to other artists. Kelly recalled the events by saying: [...] "We were all friends and often rode the train together {{to get to the}} studio". RedOne began working with Akon, who had signed Chynn to his record label. Akon and RedOne flew Gaga and Kelly to Los Angeles to write songs for Chynn's second studio album Prima Donna. [...] "Hypnotico" [...] became the first of several songs they had written together. From that trip, according to Kelly, [...] "Akon met, signed and helped launch Lady Gaga's career". Kelly credits the trip as also helping to launch his own songwriting career. He states that he and Akon became good friends and writing partners. Akon gave Kelly a CD of working tracks as a basis for composition. From that CD of tracks he wrote songs for Leona Lewis ("Forgive Me"), Whitney Houston ("Like I Never Left", [...] "I Got You") and Michael Jackson ("Hold My Hand"). According to Kelly, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a [...] "symbol of how dreams come true <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>hard,</b> and a constant reminder of how far I've come.

40|$|After World War II the new socialist system {{influenced}} {{not only}} on social and economic life, but also on penal law. Earlier theories on causes of crime and on legal measures of combating the crimes were reviewed. The punishments, including the penalty of deprivation of liberty, were supposed to play correctional and educational role. According to this theory, the system of prison organization was based on education of prisoners and on preparing them for future honest life. One {{of the most important}} measures was employment of prisoners. After the war the state needed workers and the state officials decided to use prisoners as a labour force. The motivation to make them <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> was very simple: the chance for conditional release from serving full sentence.

5000|$|Hanya Holm's {{approach}} to teaching was to liberate each individual to define a technical style {{of his or her}} own that should express their inner personality and give freedom to explore. She would tell her students, [...] "You have a perfect right to branch out, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have the stuff in <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> discover your own richness, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have something to say." [...] Holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to <b>work</b> <b>hard.</b> It was her thought that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm’s choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. She taught at Colorado College, Mills College, University of Wisconsin, Alwin Nikolais School, and was the Head of Dance Department in New York's Musical Theatre Academy. After 1974, she taught at the Juilliard School (Martha Hill, director) in New York. In 1988, a documentary of her life Hanya: Portrait of a Pioneer narrated by Julie Andrews and Alfred Drake, and featuring interviews with Holm, Nikolais, Murray Louis, and others, was released by Dance Horizons.|$|R

You plan a journey to Wesel [in 1752, to meet Frederick of Prussia] at a time when you were wanted by them here; they do not detain you; on the contrary, you are short of money, and they supply you. You accept a couple of hundred louis; this debt you forget for two or three years. At the end of that rather long term you bethink you of paying. What do they do? They hand you back your note of hand torn up, with all the air of being very glad to have served you.

His siblings are brother Aguinaldo (Nel), twin sisters, Belen and Sophie, and sister, Rachel. In 1941, Val’s {{parents and siblings}} moved to Hatch, NM to start a family farm. The farm provided a good supplement to their limited income. Val was fortunate that his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a belief that you could achieve anything <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>hard</b> enough. In 1954, Val graduated from Hatch Valley High School and earned a Ford Foundation scholarship to attend the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Due to his studious nature and talent, Val went on to attend Boy’s state and All State chorus and was editor of the year book. Unfortunately, when his father took ill, Val returned to Hatch, NM in 1956 to take over the family farm. Later on, he continued his studies. While attending UNM, Val met Calaya Trujillo, who he subsequently married in 1958. They were blessed with three daughters; Novela, Cristal and Carmela. Carmela is developmentally challenged and to this day, still resides in the loving care of her parents. As a teenager, Val always had a love for music and both he and his brother Nel were blessed with great singing voices. Some of his many heroes were, El Trio Los Panchos, and through their inspiration he and his brother Nel, learned to play the guitar. While at UNM, Val would perform in various venues to earn pocket money. A few years later Val, along with his brother Nel, recorded an album of their favorite popular Mexican-Spanish songs. Val worked for several radio stations, including KLOS & KABQ-FM among others.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we can do as parents is to help our children develop positive feelings about themselves. Children with good selfconcepts are more likely to grow into happy and productive members of society. Parents have a lot to do with how children see and feel about themselves. Providing a warm, loving relationship filled with support, encouragement, and interest in the child helps children feel good about themselves. Children who grow up with constant criticism, scoldings, or discouraging remarks are not likely to see themselves as worthy and good people. There are many things that parents can do to help children develop good self-concepts. Here are a few suggestions: Communicate respect and confidence in your children. Give them opportunities to make choices when possible. Provide opportunities to make a contribution. Assign them household chores they can handle, such as making their bed, helping to sort laundry, or setting the table. Be sure your children know you love them—even when their behavior is not acceptable. Children need to know they are loved and valued for who they are, not for what they do. Accept their feelings while helping them learn appropriate ways to express and handle negative ones. Teach your child, for example, that it’s OK to be angry and to use words to talk about what is bothering him or her, but it’s not OK to hurt others. Praise your child … thoughtfully. Be genuine and specific with praise. Children recognize empty compliments or insincere praise. Think about what you are teaching your child through the things you praise. For example, praising your child when he or she makes a good choice teaches responsibility and that he or she is capable of making good decisions. You teach your child to value effort <b>if</b> <b>you</b> praise <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> as well as praising your child’s achievements. Sometimes, responding to your child’s efforts with appreciation is as powerful as praise. Give your child opportunities to explore and learn. Take trips together to the supermarket, the library, and places in the community. Mastering new situations helps children develop confidence. Trips together also show children that you value spending time with them. To learn more about empowering your child to become confident and self-disciplined, check out thi...|$|R
