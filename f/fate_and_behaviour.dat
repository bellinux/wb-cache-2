40|$|Aliphatic {{hydrocarbons}} make up {{a substantial}} portion of organic contamination in the terrestrial environment. However, most studies have focussed on the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of aromatic contaminants in soil. Despite structural differences between aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, both classes of contaminants are subject to physicochemical processes, which can affect the degree of loss, sequestration and interaction with soil microflora. Given the nature of hydrocarbon contamination of soils and the importance of bioremediation strategies, understanding the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of aliphatic hydrocarbons is imperative, particularly microbe-contaminant interactions. Biodegradation by microbes is the key removal process of hydrocarbons in soils, which is controlled by hydrocarbon physicochemistry, environmental conditions, bioavailability and the presence of catabolically active microbes. Therefore, the aims of this review are (i) to consider the physicochemical properties of aliphatic hydrocarbons and highlight mechanisms controlling their <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> in soil; (ii) to discuss the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of aliphatic hydrocarbons in soil, with particular attention being paid to biodegradation, and (iii) to briefly consider bioremediation techniques that may be applied to remove aliphatic hydrocarbons from soil...|$|E

In this study, the earthworm Eisenia andrei {{was used to assess}} the pollutant-induced stress syndrome after exposure to sublethal concentrations of Cd (10 or 100 microg g- 1) in OECD soil, after 14 d of exposure. Cadmium bioaccumulation and potential biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA), phenoloxidase (PO), metallothioneins (MTs) and genotoxic damage were determined. Results suggested that the exposure to 10 and 100 mg g 1 Cd significantly increased Cd bioaccumulation, MTs and MDA; 100 microg g- 1 Cd contamination evidenced significantly higher values of H 2 O 2 content and PO activity; CAT activity was inhibited at the higher concentration while GST and Comet assay did not show any significant differences from the control.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) Abstract: Titania (TiO 2) {{has been}} seen {{as one of the best}} {{semiconductor}} photocatalysts capable to photodegrade organic pollutants from water. This presents a method that textile industries can use to remove organic dyes from their effluents before release. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 nanoparticles was conducted to also examine the influence of electron acceptors on the removal of dyes from water. The interaction between TiO 2 nanoparticles and industrial dyes is inevitable because of the possible application of TiO 2 in the removal of dyes in textile effluents. Therefore, the possible application of TiO 2 in the removal of dyes compels understanding the stability of TiO 2 as influenced by industrial dyes and different abiotic factors. This is important for risk assessment purposes. The stability of TiO 2 nanoparticles in the presence of disperse dye-stuff was conducted as influenced by pH, ionic strength and type of electrolyte. These parameters also influenced the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. Understanding <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is important for the environmental risk assessment of ENMs. This is due to the appearance of ENMs in WWTPs that results from the wide spread application in consumer products and industrial applications. TiO 2 has been reported as one of them. Thus, before environmental risk assessment can be conducted, studies at the points at which ENMs appear in high concentrations is important and WWTPs is one of them. Due to the in availability of nanoparticle test protocols, the Organisations of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for testing of chemicals (303 A) have been used by several researchers to study <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of nanoparticles of interest. Therefore, the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of TiO 2 nanoparticles was conducted following the OECD 303 A. The findings of this study are summarised as follows:. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{large amounts of}} {{contaminated}} sediments have been dredged and spread out along rivers. The understanding of the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> the <b>behaviour</b> of contaminants in dredged sediments is essential {{to deal with the}} management of contaminated sediments. Heavy metal leaching behaviour in dredged sediments of different ages since disposal, varying from 10 to 70 years, was assessed by pH(stat) leaching test and potentiometric titrations. Based on the pH(stat) titration results, two operationally defined pools of heavy metals, i. e., a labile and a slowly labile pool of heavy metals, were distinguished and quantified by mathematical description of leaching behaviour. The mathematical description of leaching <b>behaviour</b> during pH(stat) <b>and</b> potentiometric titrations allowed deduction of four groups of elements with a different type of leaching behaviour. Considering heavy metals, Zn, Cd and Ni displayed a leaching behaviour similar to acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), whereas the release of Cu, Pb and Cr was slower than ANC. However, no significant differences with regard to heavy metal leaching behaviour were found between sediments with different time since disposal on land. The elevated acid neutralizing capacity of the dredged sediments analysed in this study strongly decrease the risk of soil acidification with associated heavy metal leaching. The prediction of soil acidification {{over an extended period of}} time, together with the potential release of trace metals, was considered an important advantage of pH(stat) leaching tests compared to conventional leaching procedures.

40|$|In {{biological}} media, nanoparticles {{acquire a}} coating of biomolecules (proteins, lipids, polysaccharides) from their surroundings, which reduces their surface energy and confers a biological identity to the particles. This adsorbed layer is {{the interface between}} the nanomaterial and living systems and therefore {{plays a significant role}} in determining the <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the nanoparticles. This review summarises {{the state of the art}} in terms of understanding the bio-nano interface and provides direction for potential future research and recommendations for future priorities and strategies to support the safe implementation of nanotechnologies. The central premise is that nanomaterials must be studied as biological entities under the appropriate exposure conditions and that this should be implemented in study design and reporting for nanosafety assessment. The implications of the bio-nano interface for nanomaterials <b>fate</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviour</b> are described in light of four interlinked perspectives: the Coating concept; the Translocation concept; the Signalling concept, and the Kinetics concept. A key conclusion is that nanoparticles cannot be viewed as non-interacting species, but rather must be thought of, and studied as, biological entities, where their interaction with the environment is mediated by the proteins and other biomolecules that adsorb to them, and the key parameter to characterise then becomes the nature, composition and evolution of the bio-nano interfac...|$|E

We traced descendants of single ectoderm cells to study cell <b>fate</b> choice <b>and</b> cell <b>behaviour</b> at late gastrulation. In addition, we provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of anterior gene expression at stages crucial for anterior ectoderm regionalisation and neural plate formation. Our results show that, at late gastrulation stage, expression patterns of anterior ectoderm genes overlap significantly and correlate with areas of distinct prospective fates but do not define lineages. The fate map delineates a rostral limit to forebrain contribution. However, no early subdivision of the presumptive forebrain territory can be detected. Lineage analysis at single-cell resolution revealed that precursors of the anterior neural ridge (ANR), a signalling centre involved in forebrain development and patterning, are clonally related to neural ectoderm. The prospective ANR and the forebrain neuroectoderm arise from cells scattered within the same broad area of anterior ectoderm. This study establishes that although the segregation between non-neural and neural precursors in the anterior midline ectoderm is not complete at late gastrulation stage, this tissue already harbours elements of regionalisation that prefigure the later organisation of the head...|$|R
