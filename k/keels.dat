5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge <b>keels,</b> but with <b>keels</b> they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge <b>keels</b> were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Keeling</b> died on July 6, 2013 in Londonderry, New Hampshire. His {{daughter}} is Kara <b>Keeling,</b> a film and gender studies academic. Other children include, Harold <b>Keeling,</b> David <b>Keeling,</b> Lisa <b>Keeling,</b> Christopher [...] "Kip"Keeling, Tina <b>Keeling,</b> and Cory <b>Keeling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These boats {{have been}} {{manufactured}} with three <b>keel</b> variants: swing <b>Keel,</b> fin <b>Keel,</b> and wing <b>Keel.</b>|$|R

5|$|Like most Elapidae, {{the scales}} of the black mamba are smooth and flat, without <b>keels.</b> Most {{specimens}} feature 23–25 rows of scales, but rarely as few as 21.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral <b>keels.</b> A second, shorter pair of <b>keels</b> are present below the main <b>keels.</b> The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to teeth on the posterior margin.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge <b>keels</b> were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll <b>keels</b> that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5000|$|When the fin <b>keeled</b> {{and lifting}} <b>keel</b> HEOLs have raced each other, the fin <b>keel</b> {{model has been}} shown to only have a slight edge. In low or no wind conditions, the {{windward}} appendage that is the lifted <b>keel</b> of the twin <b>keel</b> model adds slight drag. In strong wind conditions, the difference is even smaller, and an astute twin <b>keel</b> crew can [...] "take" [...] a fin <b>keel</b> crew if the fin <b>keel</b> crew becomes momentarily lax.|$|R
50|$|The fixed <b>keel</b> {{version has}} {{a draft of}} 5.92 ft, while the swing <b>keel</b> version has a draft of 6.67 ft with the <b>keel</b> down and 2.00 ft with the <b>keel</b> retracted.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>keel</b> was {{associated}} in Great Britain with three particular working boat types. The Norfolk <b>Keel</b> ancestor of the Norfolk Wherry, the Humber <b>Keel</b> and the Tyne <b>Keel</b> and their Keelmen.|$|R
5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral <b>keels</b> (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their <b>keels</b> being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their <b>keels</b> were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby. This lock had {{four sets of}} gates, {{so that it could}} be used whether the level of the river was higher or lower than that of the canal. It could take <b>keels</b> up to , which could carry up to 200 tons.|$|E
5000|$|The islands {{have been}} called the Cocos Islands (from 1622), the <b>Keeling</b> Islands (from 1703), the Cocos-Keeling Islands (since James Horsburgh in 1805) and the Keeling-Cocos Islands (19th century). Cocos refers to the {{abundant}} coconut trees, while <b>Keeling</b> is William <b>Keeling,</b> reputedly the first European to sight the islands, in 1609. [...] John Clunies-Ross, who sailed there in the Borneo in 1825, called the group the Borneo Coral Isles, restricting <b>Keeling</b> to North <b>Keeling,</b> and calling South <b>Keeling</b> [...] "the Cocos properly so called". The form Cocos (<b>Keeling)</b> Islands, attested from 1916, was made official by the Cocos (<b>Keeling)</b> Islands Act 1955.|$|R
50|$|The false <b>keel</b> was a timber, forming part of {{the hull}} of a wooden sailing ship. Typically 6 inches thick for a 74-gun ship in the 19th century, the false <b>keel</b> was {{constructed}} in several pieces, which were scarphed together, and attached to {{the underside of the}} <b>keel</b> by iron staples. The false <b>keel</b> was intended to protect the main <b>keel</b> from damage, and also protect the heads of the bolts holding the main <b>keel</b> together. The false <b>keel</b> could easily be replaced when it became damaged.|$|R
50|$|It {{displaces}} 2450 lb {{and carries}} 950 lb of ballast. The boat was factory-built {{with three different}} types of fin keels: a conventional fixed <b>keel,</b> a fixed shoal-draft <b>keel</b> and a retractable swing <b>keel.</b> The boat has a draft of 4.10 ft with the standard <b>keel</b> and 2.60 ft with the optional shoal draft <b>keel.</b>|$|R
5|$|The holotype {{and only}} known specimen, {{which is in}} very poor condition, is {{preserved}} in the Museum d'Histoire Naturel de Neuchâtel as specimen MHNN 91.2426. It has five auricular lobules {{in front of the}} ears {{on each side of the}} head, 39 rows of scales around the midbody, <b>keels</b> on its dorsal scales, and the third supraocular scale in contact with the frontal scale, all characters which align it with Trachylepis rather than Mabuya. The other putative mainland South American Trachylepis, T.maculata, has five instead of three <b>keels,</b> 32 to 34 midbody scales, and separated parietal scales. T.tschudii agrees with the Noronha skink in size, coloration, numbers of scales, and discrete characters, such as having the supranasal, parietal, and prefrontal scales all in contact.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ship}} arrived in Invergordon, Baden was {{carefully}} examined by Royal Navy technicians. Naval engineers inspected the hull, including the screws, bilge <b>keels,</b> and rudders, {{to determine the}} water resistance of the hull form. The ship {{was found to have}} been approximately as efficient as the British s. The ship's armor system was extensively investigated; the British team concluded that the ship had not been modified to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland of 31 May– 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced}} by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge <b>keels,</b> previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose. The five-masted schooner sail-plan {{was replaced by}} four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, Great Britain went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs & Sons, which planned to place her into England-Australia service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Keel</b> depth (sometimes {{given as}} Depth to <b>keel)</b> is the depth (or draft) {{of water from}} the water surface to the <b>keel</b> of a vessel, its deepest part. The <b>keel</b> {{establishes}} a commonly defined reference point to measure to.|$|R
40|$|<b>Keel</b> bone {{damage is}} a wide-spread welfare problem in laying hens. It is unclear so far whether bone quality relates to <b>keel</b> bone damage. The {{goal of the}} present study was to detect {{possible}} associations between <b>keel</b> bone damage and bone properties of intact and damaged <b>keel</b> bones and of tibias in end-of-lay hens raised in loose housing systems. Bones were palpated and examined by peripheral quantitative computer tomography (PQCT), a three-point bending test, and analyses of bone ash. Contrary to our expectations, PQCT revealed higher cortical and trabecular contents in fractured than in intact <b>keel</b> bones. This might be due to structural bone repair after fractures. Density measurements of cortical and trabecular tissues of <b>keel</b> bones did not differ between individuals with and without fractures. In the three-point bending test of the tibias, ultimate shear strength was significantly higher in birds with intact vs. fractured <b>keel</b> bones. Likewise, birds with intact or slightly deviated <b>keel</b> bones had higher mineral and calcium contents of the <b>keel</b> bone than birds with fractured <b>keel</b> bones. Calcium content in <b>keel</b> bones was correlated with calcium content in tibias. Although there were some associations between bone traits related to bone strength and <b>keel</b> bone damage, other factors such as stochastic events related to housing such as falls and collisions seem to be at least as important for the prevalence of <b>keel</b> bone damage...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{distinct}} designs, although appearing the same above the waterline, the <b>keel</b> layout under the waterline {{is either a}} single fin <b>keel</b> or a triple <b>keel.</b> The triple <b>keel</b> allows the yacht to stand almost upright, ideal for tidal moorings and storage on land.|$|R
5|$|The ships' hulls {{were divided}} into {{fourteen}} watertight compartments and had double bottoms that ran for 83percent {{of the length of}} their <b>keels.</b> Both vessels had side bulges and bulbous bows. They were constructed with longitudinal steel frames, and were more than 90percent welded in order to save weight. Nürnberg had a large, blocky forward superstructure, while Leipzigs superstructure resembled that of the preceding Königsberg class. Nürnberg also had a large searchlight platform fitted on the funnel, while Leipzig did not.|$|E
5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge <b>keels</b> were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat <b>keels.</b> Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two ships}} {{of the ten}} were completed: Cöln and Dresden. Five other ships were launched, but not completed—these ships {{received}} names—and the remaining three had only had some work done to their <b>keels</b> before work ceased. These latter three ships were known only by their contract names. Cöln and Dresden had very limited careers, since they were completed so late in the war. They both participated in a fleet sortie into the northern North Sea that attempted to intercept a heavily-escorted convoy from Britain to Norway. And they {{were assigned to the}} abortive final sortie in October 1918. Both cruisers were interned in Scapa Flow and scuttled there in June 1921, and both remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have <b>keels,</b> although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for M {{was assigned to}} Deutsche Werke in Kiel under the construction number 263. N followed at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven, as number 129. Oconstruction number 606was assigned to Germaniawerft in Kiel, but on 8 August 1939, the contract {{was transferred to the}} Kriegsmarinewerft. P was also assigned to Germaniawerft, under number 607. Q was assigned to Schichau in Danzig, and the {{contract for}} R was awarded to the Deutsche Werke. Only the <b>keels</b> for M and N were laidin 1938but construction was halted on 19 and 21 September 1939, respectively. Both hulls were broken up on the stocks shortly thereafter.|$|E
