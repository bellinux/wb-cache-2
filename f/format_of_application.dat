The molecule combines many features that are similar to those of natural nucleic acids with characteristics that are rather different or even unique to PNA. First and foremost, N-(2 -aminoethyl) -glycine units linked by ▶amide bonds substitute the (deoxy) ribosephosphate backbone and the nucleobases are attached via a methylene carbonyl link to the glycine moiety. Nevertheless, the distances and angles within PNA oligomers much resemble the conformation of nucleic acids (Fig. 1).

40|$|The {{design of}} {{composite}} beams with large rectangular or circular openings {{is an important}} structural and practical problem which {{is caused by the}} need to pass service ducts through the structural zone of floor systems. Careful sizing and positioning of these openings in the beam webs can minimise their adverse effects on the shear and the bending resistances of composite beams. A design method [1][Lawson, RM. Design for openings in the webs of composite beams. The Steel Construction Institute/CIRIA joint publication SCI-P 068, 1987. ] for composite beams with large web openings was first formulated in accordance with BS 5950 and calibrated against full-scale tests in 1992 [2][Lawson RM, Chung KF, Price AM. Tests on composite beams with large web openings to justify existing design methods. Struct Eng 1992 : 70 (1). ]. With the release of the draft Eurocode 4 in 1994 [3][ENV 1994 - 1 - 1 : Eurocode 4 : design of composite steel and concrete structures. BSI, 1994. ], this paper re-presents the design method in the <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> rules to Eurocode 4 for detailed design of composite beams with large web openings. Moreover, the designer needs advice at the scheme design stage, and this paper also presents general information on sizing of openings {{as a function of the}} utilisation of the shear and the bending resistances of composite beams. Furthermore, the effect of these openings on deflections is estimated by a simple factor which is dependent on the size and the location of the openings. Typical design tables for composite beams with large rectangular openings are presented. Design rules for other forms of construction such as circular openings and notched beams are also presented with general detailing rules to assist designers.

40|$|The Designers' Workbench is a system, {{developed}} by the Advanced Knowledge Technologies (AKT) consortium to support designers in large organizations, such as Rolls-Royce, {{to ensure that the}} design is consistent with the specification for the particular design {{as well as with the}} company's design rule book(s). In the principal application discussed here, the evolving design is described against a jet engine ontology. Design rules are expressed as constraints over the domain ontology. Currently, to capture the constraint information, a domain expert (design engineer) has to work with a knowledge engineer to identify the constraints, and it is then the task of the knowledge engineer to encode these into the Workbench's knowledge base (KB). This is an error prone and time consuming task. It is highly desirable to relieve the knowledge engineer of this task, and so we have developed a system, ConEditor+ that enables domain experts themselves to capture and maintain these constraints. Further we hypothesize that in order to appropriately apply, maintain and reuse constraints, it is necessary to understand the underlying assumptions and context in which each constraint is applicable. We refer to them as “application conditions” and these form a part of the rationale associated with the constraint. We propose a methodology to capture the application conditions associated with a constraint and demonstrate that an explicit representation (machine interpretable <b>format)</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> conditions (rationales) together with the corresponding constraints and the domain ontology can be used by a machine to support maintenance of constraints. Support for the maintenance of constraints includes detecting inconsistencies, subsumption, redundancy, fusion between constraints and suggesting appropriate refinements. The proposed methodology provides immediate benefits to the designers and hence should encourage them to input the application conditions (rationales) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Extracting the {{protocol}} message <b>format</b> specifications <b>of</b> unknown <b>applications</b> from network traces {{is important for}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> such as application protocol parsing, vulnerability discovery, and system integration. In this paper, we propose ProDecoder, a network trace based protocol message format inference system that exploits the semantics of protocol messages without the executable code <b>of</b> <b>application</b> protocols. ProDecoder {{is based on the}} key insight that the n-grams of protocol traces exhibit highly skewed frequency distribution that can be leveraged for accurate protocol message format inference. In ProDecoder, we first discover the latent relationship among n-grams by first grouping protocol messages with the same semantics and then inferring message formats by keyword based clustering and cluster sequence alignment. We implemented and evaluated ProDecoder to infer message <b>format</b> specifications <b>of</b> SMB (a binary protocol) and SMTP (a textual protocol). Our experimental results show that ProDecoder accurately parses and infers SMB protocol with 100 % precision and recall. For SMTP, ProDecoder achieves approximately 95 % precision and recall...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring the {{security}} and integrity of computer systems deployed on the Internet is growing harder. This {{is especially true in}} the case of server systems based on open source projects like Linux, Apache, Sendmail, etc. since it is easier for a hacker to get access to the binary <b>format</b> <b>of</b> deployed <b>applications</b> if the source code to the software is publicly accessible. Often, having a binary copy <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> program is enough to help locate security vulnerabilities in the program. In the case of legacy systems where the source code is not available, advanced reverse-engineering and decompilation techniques can be used to construct attacks. This paper focuses on measures that reduce the effectiveness of hackers at conducting large-scale, distributed attacks. The first line of defense involves additional runtime checks that are able to counteract the majority of hacking attacks. Introducing diversity in deployed systems to severely diminish the probability of propagation to other systems helps to prevent effective attacks like the DDOS attack against the DNS root servers in October 21, 2002. ...|$|R
