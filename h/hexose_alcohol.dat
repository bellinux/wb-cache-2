40|$|Modifications of plasma {{lipoprotein}} {{structure and}} function resulting from in vivo post-translational nonenzymatic glycosylation {{may play a role}} in the premature atherosclerosis of patients with diabetes mellitus. This report describes the generation and characterization of six unique murine monoclonal antibodies that bind glucosylated human plasma lipoproteins, but do not react with normal plasma lipoproteins. This was accomplished by immunizing mice with homologous glucosylated low density lipoprotein. In competitive inhibition radioimmunoassays, the dominant epitope recognized by these antibodies on glucosylated low density lipoprotein was identified as glucitollysine, the reduced <b>hexose</b> <b>alcohol</b> form of glucose conjugated to the epsilon amino group of lysine. Each of these antibodies was capable of identifying glucitollysine epitopes on all reduced glucosylated proteins studied, including high density lipoprotein, albumin, hemoglobin, and transferrin. These antibodies were also capable of identifying and quantitating glucitollysine residues on the total plasma proteins and isolated lipoproteins of normal and diabetic individuals after reduction of the proteins with NaBH 4. Preliminary data suggest that diabetic total plasma proteins and isolated lipoproteins contain at least threefold more immunochemically detectable glucitollysine residues than nondiabetic plasma proteins and lipoproteins. The technique described in this report should allow production of region-specific antibodies to any immunogenic modification of a protein...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial wilt {{caused by}} Ralstonia solanacearum E. F. Smith {{is one of}} the {{destructive}} diseases of solanaceous vegetables specially tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). Experiments were conducted to determine biovar types existing among the strains or isolates of Nepal and variation in virulence in some vegetables belonging to solanaceae family. A total of 39 isolates infecting tomato, eggplant, chilli and potato collected from different parts of Nepal were analyzed for biovar types on the basis of 3 disaccharides and 3 <b>hexose</b> <b>alcohols</b> oxidation test. Experiments were conducted to determine variation in virulence or aggressiveness of some of the isolates under screen house conditions using three host differentials such as Pusa Ruby (susceptible), Bishesh (moderately resistant) and Srijana (resistant) tomato cultivars. Of the 39 isolates, 23 were biovar III, three biovar II, three biovar IV, and one was biovar I. Nine isolates could not be differentiated into any of the five biovars. For breeding and epidemiological purposes {{it is very important to}} analyze the variability of aggressiveness. A total of 5 isolates collected from different places were included in the test. Isolates from Bhaktapur was found the most virulent causing wilt in the variety Bishesh (moderately resistant). Other isolates had the negative impact with zero wilt on the differentials used. Isolates from Jungekhola of Dhading district did not induce wilt even on susceptible variety (Pusa Ruby), but exhibited only senescence reaction. The result indicated that there is some slight variation among the isolates tested. Some effective management tactics might be needed in those locations where highly aggressive or virulent strain of bacterial wilt is prevalent, because resistant variety may not be stable in such locations...|$|R
30|$|Basidiospores secrete {{hygroscopic}} <b>hexoses</b> and <b>alcohols</b> (mannitol) localized {{at their}} hilar appendices for {{the assembly of}} Buller’s drops and at their adaxial shallow dents as hygroscopic compounds {{for the formation of}} liquid films, both of which are required for rapid spore catapulting upon their fusion (Goates and Hoffmann 1986; Webster et al. 1989, 1995; Turner and Webster 1995). These organic metabolites together with inorganic ions like phosphate, sodium and potassium are transferred with the liquids spread over the propelled-off spores onto the lids of the Petri-dishes where they might act further hygroscopically to attract more water to the spores (Elbert et al. 2007; Hassett et al. 2015). Eventually, the metabolites might be used for growth of any microbial contaminants happened to be present in the liquid droplets in which basidiospores amplify on the plastic lids during mushroom incubation (Fig.  1). Such microbial growth effect can explain the explosive sudden increase in bacterial cells which was observed more often in spore samples collected after longer incubation times of mushrooms (Fig.  6).|$|R
30|$|Rhizopus oryzae NBRC 5384 was {{selected}} for thermotolerant lactic acid production from Rhizopus library because of its heat tolerance up to 40  °C and high lactic acid production of 80  g/L. The strain can ferment to lactic acid from <b>hexose,</b> pentose, sugar <b>alcohol,</b> disaccharide and starch. The soaking of raw PS in NaOH and HCl was able to reduce effectively inorganic materials and other reagents for repulping, {{and the content of}} Al and Ca per PS dry matter was mainly decreased from 32.9 and 30.8 to 14.1 and 1.66  %, respectively. SSF of the treated PS of 50  g/L with optimized cellulase cocktail and 5384 at 40  °C resulted in lactic acid production of 9.33  g/L for 96  h.|$|R
40|$|Fermenting {{anaerobic}} {{cultures of}} Escherichia coli were observed by the nonintrusive technique of in vivo, whole-culture nuclear magnetic resonance. Fermentation balances {{were calculated for}} <b>hexoses,</b> pentoses, sugar <b>alcohols,</b> and sugar acids. Substrates more reduced than glucose yielded more of the highly reduced fermentation product ethanol, whereas more-oxidized substrates produced more of the less-reduced fermentation product acetate. These relationships were made more obvious {{by the introduction of}} ldhA mutations, which abolished lactate production, and delta frd mutations, which eliminated succinate. When grown anaerobically on sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, E. coli produced ethanol in excess of the amount calculated by the standard fermentation pathways. Reducing equivalents must be recycled from formate to account for this excess of ethanol. In mutants deficient in hydrogenase (hydB), ethanol production from sorbitol was greatly decreased, implying that hydrogen gas released from formate by the formate-hydrogen lyase system may be partially recycled, in the wild type, to increase the yield of the highly reduced fermentation product ethanol...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{isolated}} Ringer-perfused frog liver, to concentrate dyestuffs in its secretion several hundred times, can be abolished entirely and reversibly by replacing in the Ringer solution about 1 / 8 of the NaCl by the isosmotic amount of a surface-inactive non-electrolyte (disaccharide, <b>hexose,</b> pentose, polyhydric <b>alcohol,</b> amino acid, acid amide) or electrolyte (salts of lower fatty acids, hydroxyl carboxylic, and dicarboxylic acids). This effect is not dependent upon changes in the perfusion rate. The opposite effect, promotion of secretory activity, can be brought about by polar-non-polar electrolytes (salts of higher fatty acids, bile acids, and other aromatic carboxylic acids, aromatic sulfonic acids) and surface-active non-electrolytes (anesthetics, alkaloids, digitonin). However, reversibility of this effect cannot be regularly observed, since cytolysis is frequently the end result. Suitable concentrations of inhibitory and promoting substances, simultaneously applied, counteract each other. Inhibitory and promoting substances, in general, exhibit opposite effects upon the dispersion of colloids (starch, lecithin, gelatin). The correlation between the physicochemical and the physiological action of the organic compounds is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho apresenta o desenvolvimento e otimizaÃÂÃÂo de metodologias para a produÃÂÃÂo e caracterizaÃÂÃÂo de hidromel preparado por meio de diferentes tipos de mel e fermentaÃÂÃÂo. AlÃÂm disso, foram {{realizadas}} caracterizaÃÂÃÂes de pH, acidez, umidade, oB, teor de cinzas e umidade, por termogravimetria, e teor de aÃÂÃÂcares redutores totais dos mÃÂis utilizados, permitindo a comparaÃÂÃÂo entre eles, analisando a influÃÂncia da sua procedÃÂncia geogrÃÂfica. Para os hidromÃÂis preparados foram aplicados os mesmos testes anteriormente mencionados com exceÃÂÃÂo da termogravimetria e realizada a determinaÃÂÃÂo da concentraÃÂÃÂo de 5 -HMF ao final das fermentaÃÂÃÂes curtas e longas, obtendo-se os valores mÃÂdios de 0, 210 ÃÂ 0, 041 e 0, 839 ÃÂ 0, 198 ÃÂg. mL- 1, respectivamente. Estes valores mostram que a bebida estÃÂ dentro dos padrÃÂes internacionais de qualidade para este indicador e observando-se que em tempos mais longos ocorre maior formaÃÂÃÂo deste composto devido ÃÂ maior exposiÃÂÃÂo dos carboidratos ao meio propÃÂcio ÃÂ desidrataÃÂÃÂo das hexoses. O grau alcoÃÂlico obtido apresenta diferenÃÂas entre fermentaÃÂÃÂes curtas e longas, pois nas ÃÂltimas foi possÃÂvel obter valores com mÃÂdia 10 oGL e para as primeiras, de 8, 75 oGL. Isto mostra que quando se deseja alcanÃÂar teores de ÃÂlcool maiores na bebida devem-se empregar fermentaÃÂÃÂes em tempos mais longos. A comparaÃÂÃÂo entre as bebidas preparadas foi realizada por meio de anÃÂlise sensorial, onde se determinou o perfil sensorial da amostra e sua aceitabilidade pelo consumidor. Para isto realizou-se o treinamento dos provadores, pois se trata de uma bebida ainda pouco conhecida pelo mercado consumidor brasileiro. Verificou-se uma maior aceitabilidade do hidromel preparado a partir de um mel considerado ruim para o consumo in natura, com uma bebida preparada a partir de um bom mel para consumo in natura ocupando o segundo lugar. Os resultados experimentais obtidos foram tratados por meio de ANOVA de dois fatores a 95 % de confianÃÂa, para que fosse possÃÂvel a comparaÃÂÃÂo entre as diferentes bebidas preparadas. Verificou-se ser possÃÂvel o preparo do hidromel a partir desta metodologia que, se realizada de forma adequada, preserva todas as propriedades benÃÂficas do mel, o que nÃÂo ocorre com os processos tradicionais. Esta ÃÂ uma excelente opÃÂÃÂo para as regiÃÂes de proteÃÂÃÂo ambiental, pois as abelhas ajudam na polinizaÃÂÃÂo das flores, e com isso se pode aplicar a apicultura nestas regiÃÂes. E como a produÃÂÃÂo de mel ÃÂ realizada predominantemente pela agricultura familiar, a produÃÂÃÂo do hidromel pode levar a uma melhor distribuiÃÂÃÂo de renda. Isso propiciaria a estas famÃÂlias permanecerem no campo, evitando o ÃÂxodo rural, por meio do incentivo ÃÂ produÃÂÃÂo de mel pelo preparo em larga escala do hidromel, agregando valor a um produto ainda pouco consumido em nosso paÃÂs. This work {{presents the}} development and optimization of methodologies for the production and characterization of mead, produced from different kinds of honey and by means of different fermentation times. Besides that, characterizations of pH, acidity, humidity, ÃÂB, ashes and humidity contents, by means of thermogravimetric analysis, and total reducing sugars content of the employed kinds of honey were realized, allowing comparisons among them, ascertaining the influence of their geographic origin. All, but the thermogravimetric analysis, of the aforementioned tests were also applied to the mead and the concentration of 5 -HMF {{at the end of}} both short and long fermentation times was determined, with average values 0, 210 ÃÂ 0, 041 and 0, 839 ÃÂ 0, 198 ÃÂg. mL- 1, respectively. These values show that the beverage is within the international standards of quality regarding this parameter and show also that longer times lead to greater concentrations of this compound, due to the longer exposition of carbohydrates to a medium adequate to the dehydration of <b>hexoses.</b> The <b>alcohol</b> content obtained shows variations among long and short fermentation times, since in the last ones average values of 10 ÃÂGL were obtained, versus 8, 75 ÃÂGL for the first ones. This shows that if higher alcohol contents are sought, longer fermentation times should be employed. The comparison among the prepared beverages was realized by means of sensory analysis, where the sensory profile of the samples and their acceptability to the consumer were assessed. The testers were previously trained, because it is still a not very well known beverage in the Brazilian consumer market. It was verified that the mead produced from a honey generally considered unsuitable for fresh consumption was the one most strongly appreciated by the testers, with a mead produced from a honey more suitable for fresh consumption coming in the second place. The experimental results obtained were subject to two-way ANOVA, with 95 % confidence rate, to allow the comparison among the different prepared beverages. It was verified that the production of mead employing the proposed methodology is possible, with the advantage that this process, if executed correctly, preserves all the beneficial properties of the honey, unlike the traditional methodology. This is an excelling perspective for the regions of environmental protection, since bees intervene in the pollination of the flowers, and thus apiculture can be exerted in these areas. As honey production is mainly carried through by family farming, mead production may lead to better income distribution. This would allow to these families to remain in the countryside, avoiding rural exodus, for it stimulates the production of honey to supply the demand created by mead production and aggregates value to a product still barely consumed in our country...|$|R
