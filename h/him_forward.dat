5|$|Vijay {{leaves for}} Mandwa to avenge {{the death of}} his father and his wife and after an intense battle with Kancha, kills him by hanging him from the same tree in which his father was hanged. However due to his severe injuries, Vijay is last seen in his mother's lap passing away whilst seeing a vision of his father and his younger self calling <b>him</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard {{enrolled}} at Helena High School, where he contributed to the school paper, but earned only poor grades. He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. He joined his parents in Guam in June 1928. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> for the entrance examination to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} playable {{characters}} are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in AD 600. He {{is a former}} squire once named Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 {{is in a state}} of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{an injured}} Masséna, leading his IV Corps from a {{conspicuous}} white phaeton, was also executing his orders and approaching the sector {{with three of}} his infantry divisions and his cavalry. In compliance with Napoleon's orders, Masséna's fourth infantry division, under General Boudet, had been left far to the south, defending the village of Aspern. The manoeuvre of IV Corps was hampered {{by the arrival of}} the leading battalions of the d'Aspré's division from the Austrian Grenadier Reserve, which delayed Masséna's rearguard division, under General Legrand. Arriving with his other two divisions in the vicinity of Aderklaa towards 07:30, Masséna was spotted by Napoleon, who got into the Marshal's phaeton to consult with him about the situation they were facing and, after a brief discussion, the Emperor ordered the recapture of Aderklaa. Masséna instructed General Carra Saint-Cyr to storm Aderklaa with his division and, seeing that the General delayed his action, trying to find a weak spot of the solid position, the Marshal hurried <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> for an immediate attack. The assault was led by the 24th Light and 4th Line regiments, which were followed by the excellent Hessian Guard brigade. Further east, the still combat-worthy Saxon Corps, including the Franco-Saxon division of General Dupas also moved forward, in a bid to launch a supporting attack between Aderklaa and Deutsch-Wagram. The 24th Light and 4th Line successfully drove back the two Austrian battalions positioned before the village, which broke and caused some disorder in the Austrian first line. The French impetuously moved into Aderklaa and then tried to launch a pursuit beyond this position, but, as soon as they moved out of the village, they were met with sustained fire from Bellegarde's second infantry line. The two regiments withdrew to Aderklaa, where they were reinforced by the Hessian Guard brigade and ordered to hold the position. Not far away from this position, the attack of the Saxons also came to a grinding halt and these men were driven back, exposing the flank of the French troops occupying Aderklaa. At this moment, the Austrians enjoyed a substantial, albeit temporary numerical advantage in this sector, 44,000 men to the French 35,000. This was thus the right time for a general attack, but the Austrian military doctrine discouraged commanders from taking too much initiative, and Bellegarde chose to stick to his orders and wait for III Korps, whose leading elements were only just coming up, in line with the Grenadiers.|$|E

500|$|The third {{match was}} a Serengeti Survival match between Monty Brown and Abyss. In this match, {{there were no}} {{disqualifications}} {{and the only way}} to win was by pinfall, submission, or by slamming the opponent into a pile of thumbtacks. Mid-way through the match, Brown grabbed a bag of tacks and poured them on the ring-mat. Afterwards, Brown and Abyss fought to slam each other into the tacks until Brown lifted Abyss up onto his shoulders and threw <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> down to the ring-mat. [...] Brown's throw caused Abyss to fall on the tacks with his head and back, giving the win to Brown.|$|E
500|$|The Cave of PROTEUS rises {{out of the}} Sea; it {{consists}} of several arches of Rock-work adorned with mother-of-pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the Sea, and parts of Dover-pier; {{in the middle of}} the Cave is PROTEUS asleep on a rock adorned with shells, [...] like the Cave. [...] ALBION and ACACIA seize on him; and while a symphony is playing, he sinks as they are bringing <b>him</b> <b>forward,</b> and changes himself into a Lion, a Crocodile, a Dragon, and then to his own shape again; he comes forward to the front of the stage, and sings." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite good notices for the opera, Stanford's {{star was}} waning. In {{the first decade}} of the century, his music became eclipsed by that of a younger composer, Edward Elgar. In the words of the music scholar Robert Anderson, Stanford [...] "had his innings with {{continental}} reputation in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, but then Elgar bowled him out." [...] When Elgar was struggling for recognition in the 1890s, Stanford had been supportive of his younger colleague, conducting his music, putting <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> for a Cambridge doctorate, and proposing him for membership of the exclusive London club, the Athenaeum. He was, however, put out when Elgar's success at home and abroad eclipsed his own, with Richard Strauss (whom Stanford detested) praising Elgar as the first progressive English composer. When Elgar was appointed professor of music at Birmingham University in 1904, Stanford wrote him a letter that the recipient found [...] "odious". Elgar retaliated in his inaugural lecture with remarks about composers of rhapsodies, widely seen as denigrating Stanford. Stanford later counter-attacked in his book A History of Music, writing of Elgar, [...] "Cut off from his contemporaries by his religion and his want of regular academic training, he was lucky enough to enter the field and find the preliminary ploughing done." ...|$|E

5000|$|After a {{month in}} the hospital, Gruber and the other prisoners were transported to Stalag 13, a camp in Langwasser, Germany, near Nuremberg. On the second day, Jews were ordered to present themselves. Gruber hesitated, but two of his Polish [...] "friends" [...] shoved <b>him</b> <b>forwards</b> saying, [...] "Here is a Jew." [...] The prisoners were transported from Nuremberg to Ludwigsburg and then to Münsingen, Germany. Because of his injured arm, Gruber was {{assigned}} to work in the kitchen. Gruber spoke fluent German, so he also helped out in the German offices.|$|R

2500|$|The Spanish {{and local}} Macabebe {{soldiers}} broke into loud laughter seeing the kneeling Duman in a feverish frenzy of emotion. [...] But unknown to them, Fr. Vicente Lapus {{was standing right}} behind the closed church door listening and watching everything through the small cracks. (This was how Payumu's prayer was recorded by Padre Lapus for posterity). The impatient Spanish lieutenant barked: “Puñeta! Todo esto lo que haces es ya de masiado! Levantate!” (Goddammit! This is all simply getting too much! Stand up!). Knowing no Spanish, Duman remained kneeling down and was weeping in utter hopelessness feeling abandoned to certain death by the Apu. [...] Without warning, a local soldier grabbed his arm and forcefully pulled him up, yelling: “Puta naida mo! Ticdo na ca canu! Panaca ning alte! (Son of a bitch! Stand up now! You thunderstrucked!). Losing his balance, Duman fell to the ground. The guards pulled him up and brusquely pushed <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> to the execution spot, which was the corner church wall before reaching the present sacristy door.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} five years, Grattan took no active part in public affairs; it was not till 1805 that he became a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Malton. He {{modestly}} took his seat {{on one of the}} back benches, till Fox brought <b>him</b> <b>forward,</b> exclaiming, [...] "This is no place for the Irish Demosthenes!" [...] His first speech was on the Catholic question and all agreed with the description of his speech by the Annual Register {{as one of the most}} brilliant and eloquent ever made within the walls of parliament. When Fox and William Grenville came into power in 1806 Grattan, who sat at this time for Dublin City, was offered, but refused to accept, an office in the government. In the following year he showed the strength of his judgment and character by supporting, in spite of consequent unpopularity in Ireland, a measure for increasing the powers of the executive to deal with Irish disorder. Roman Catholic emancipation, which he continued to advocate with unflagging energy, though now advanced in age, became complicated after 1808 by the question whether a veto on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops should rest with the crown.|$|E

2500|$|In The Archaeology of Baptism (1876) Wolfrid Cote, quoting Prudentius, {{who in his}} Psychomachia {{spoke of}} the [...] "bathed chests" [...] of the baptized, and the views of two earlier Italian archaeologists, stated that [...] "the {{primitive}} mode {{appears to have been}} this: The administrator and candidate both standing in the water the former placed his right hand on the head of the candidate, and, pronouncing the baptismal words, gently bowed <b>him</b> <b>forward,</b> till he was completely immersed in the water". He included in his book a woodcut of a fresco in the Catacomb of San Callisto (a photographic reproduction appears in this article), and reported that one archaeologist interpreted it as a youth being baptized by affusion, while for another the youth standing in the water was [...] "immersed in a cloud of water". Cote described this painting as of great antiquity, probably of the 4th or 5th century, while remarking {{that it is impossible to}} ascertain the precise age of the pictures in the catacombs of Rome. [...] The other paintings that Cote described are of much later periods, while the mosaic in the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte, in Ravenna (erected in the 4th century), which shows John baptizing Jesus by pouring water on his head from a cup, Cote explained as the product of later restoring. The font in this baptistery Cote described as ten feet in diameter and three and a half feet deep. Cote listed 67 still existing Italian baptisteries dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries, all of which he understood to have been used for total immersion. He made no mention of any pre-Constantine evidence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with older instructions direct from Henri II, the French faction was supporting Cardinal d'Este, then the Cardinal de Tournon (who {{was not present}} at the Conclave), and then Cardinal du Bellay. The Emperor, as in the Conclave of 1550, had a preference for Cardinal Reginald Pole, the Papal Legate in England. Pole, however, was strongly opposed by the French (in ignorance of the letters which Farnese was carrying), and by Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa, the Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals and principal Inquisitor of the Roman Inquisition, who regarded Pole (and {{a number of other}} cardinals) as Protestant heretics. D'Este was not electable (Sir John Masone, the English agent wrote: [...] "Marry, we hear of no quality to set <b>him</b> <b>forward</b> but that he is rich."), though the six votes he received in the first ballot caused considerable consternation, and the beginning of a [...] "Stop D'Este" [...] movement. Some of the cleverer cardinals, led by Carafa and Madruzzi of Trent, realized that, when all the opinions were factored in, there were very few electable cardinals, the best of whom was Cardinal Marcello Cervini. [...] He was a reformer, he was strict, and he was uncorrupted; he was opposed to nepotism. Unfortunately, Cervini was disliked by the Emperor. But the genuine reformers, who wanted the resumption of the Council of Trent, worked with Carafa and Madruzzi to produce a two-thirds majority. Among them were Ranuccio Farnese, Farnese's brother, and Guido Ascanio Sforza, his first-cousin. When Farnese finally arrived from Avignon in mid-April, he was no doubt delighted to find his grandfather's secretary, Cardinal Marcello Cervini, on the throne of Peter. Unfortunately, {{on the morning of the}} 18th, Pope Marcellus II showed symptoms of a fever and in the night between April 30 and May 1, he died. But even before Marcellus was dead, Cardinal Farnese wrote directly to Henri II, urging him to send the French cardinals to Rome immediately. A second Conclave was necessary.|$|E
