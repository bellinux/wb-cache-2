50|$|Sediment {{chemistry}} {{provides information}} on contamination, however it does not provide information of biological effects (Chapman, 1990). Sediment chemistry {{is used as a}} screening tool to determine the contaminants that {{are most likely to be}} destructive to organisms present in the benthic community at a specific site. During analysis, sediment chemistry data does not depend strictly on comparisons to sediment quality guidelines when utilizing the triad approach. Rather, sediment chemistry data, once collected for the specific site, is compared to the most relevant <b>guide</b> <b>values,</b> based on site characteristics, to assess which chemicals are of the greatest concern. This technique is used because no one set of data is adequate for all situations. This allows you to identify the chemicals of concern, which most frequently exceed effects-based guidelines. Once the chemical composition of the sediment is determined and the most concerning contaminants have been identified, toxicity tests are conducted to link environmental concentrations to potential adverse effects.|$|E

In the Preto River (urban area), high Zn concentrations are due to anthropic sources, whereas the high levels of total nitrogen, Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, and Ni in the Turvo river (damming, rural area) are due to agricultural runoff.

The components reported are SO 2, black smoke, NO 2, NOx (= NO 2 + NO), NO, O 3, OX (= NO 2 + O 3), and CO. In 1989 several summer smog episodes occurred which contributed to exceedence of Dutch air quality limit values for NO 2 on a few stations. However exceedence of the Dutch draft limit values for O 3 were not detected. At a few stations the limit values for black smoke were exceeded and at one station the maximal allowable hour value was exceeded once caused by an incidental polluting activity. <b>Guide</b> <b>values</b> for SO 2 and NO 2 were exceeded at 6 % and 80 % resp. {{of the total number}} of stations.

40|$|We {{report on}} germania and alumina dopant profile shift effects at {{preparation}} of compact optical fibers using packaging methods (Stack-and-Draw method, Rod-in-Tube (RiT) technique). The sintering of package hollow volume by viscous flow {{results in a}} shift of the core-pitch ratio in all-solid microstructured fibers. The ratio is increased by about 5 % {{in the case of}} a hexagonal package. The shift by diffusion effects of both dopants is simulated for typical slow speed drawing parameters. Thermodynamic approximations of surface dissociation of germania doped silica suggest the need of an adequate undoped silica barrier layer to prevent an undesired bubble formation at fiber drawing. In contrast, alumina doping does not estimate critical dissociation effects with vaporous aluminium oxide components. We report <b>guide</b> <b>values</b> of diffusion length of germania and alumina for the drawing process by kinetic approximation. The germania diffusion involves a small core enlargement, typically in the sub-micrometer scale. Though, the alumina diffusion enlarges it by a few micrometers.

The aim {{of the project was}} to improve the living conditions of the village people by controlling the quality of drinking water. Therefore, a "multiple barrier approach", based on risk prevention, risk management, monitoring and compliance for insuring a safe drinking water supply, was applied including water treatment at household level and the assessment of the chemical-microbial risk. Water treatment was applied in order to reduce fluoride concentration in groundwater. Risk assessment was done throughout the chain from the catchment to the consumer so as to initiate appropriate remedial and preventive actions. Water was sampled from different points all along the supply system in order to verify the evolution of water quality and to identify the sources of pollution. Fluorides and microorganisms exceeded the World Health Organisation <b>Guide</b> <b>Values,</b> thus representing a serious health problem.

40|$|We {{performed}} epidemiologic {{studies at}} public freshwater bathing sites in Germany {{to provide a}} better scientific basis for the definition of recreational water quality standards. A total of 2, 196 participants were recruited from the local population and randomized into bathers and nonbathers. Bathers were exposed for 10 min and had to immerse their head at least three times. Water samples for microbiological analysis were collected at 20 -min intervals. Unbiased concentration–response effects with no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were demonstrated for three different definitions of gastroenteritis and four fecal indicator organisms. Relative risks for bathing in waters with levels above NOAELs compared with nonbathing ranged from 1. 8 (95 % CI, 1. 2 – 2. 6) to 4. 6 (95 % CI, 2. 1 – 10. 1), depending on the definition of gastroenteritis. The effect of swallowing water provided additional evidence for true dose–response relationships.
