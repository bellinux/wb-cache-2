5|$|James Lawrence Brooks (born May 9, 1940) is an Academy Award-, Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning American {{television}} and movie director, producer and screenwriter. Growing up in North Bergen, New Jersey, Brooks endured a fractured {{family life and}} passed the time by reading and writing. After dropping out of New York University, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as an usher at CBS, going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper's documentaries. After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him {{a job as a}} writer on the series My Mother the Car.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} {{getting up}} at 6 a.m., {{not good for}} a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard {{of one of the}} war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.|$|E

Rymkus stayed in the position until the team folded later that year due to financial difficulties; the team's owner, Frank Hurn, ran out of money and stopped paying the Vulcans' bills.|$|E

Ella was from Baltimore. The Oppenheimers were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews. In 1912 the family moved to an apartment on the 11th floor of 155 Riverside Drive, near West 88th Street, Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso and Édouard Vuillard, and at least three original paintings by Vincent van Gogh. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.|$|E

Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company {{was that he was}} able to visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a very big part of his life. Later he transferred to Eatons advertising department where he drew black and white adverts, while studying at night school twice a week.|$|E
