Amongst the considered techniques, the iterative precoding techniques based on the full CSIT still provides the best capacity gain. Besides, the capacity gaps among all the precoding schemes also increase, especially for the ones based on the full CSIT. Figure 7 indicates that when SNR 2 = 12 dB our both <b>designs</b> <b>with</b> the partial CSIT outperform the equal precoding, and more interestingly, the iterative <b>design</b> <b>with</b> the partial CSIT yields higher capacity than the simplified <b>design</b> <b>with</b> the full CSIT over the low-to-medium SNR 1 range, with up to 15 dB.

40|$|AbstractIf {{there are}} less than b {{distinct}} blocks in a BIB <b>design</b> <b>with</b> b blocks then we say the design has repeated blocks. The set of distinct blocks of a design is called {{the support of the}} <b>design.</b> BIB <b>designs</b> <b>with</b> repeated blocks, besides being optimal, have special applications in the design of experiments and controlled samplings. Construction of BIB(ν, b, r, k, λ) <b>designs</b> <b>with</b> repeated blocks becomes complicated whenever the three parameters b, r, and λ are relatively prime. BIB(8, 56, 21, 3, 6) designs are examples of such <b>designs</b> <b>with</b> the smallest number of varieties.
