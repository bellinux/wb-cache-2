5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, <b>issuer</b> of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first empirical analysis of firms' rationale for issuing putable convertible bonds in the literature. We distinguish between three possible rationales for {{the issuance of}} putable convertibles: 1) the risk-shifting hypothesis, 2) the asymmetric information hypothesis, and 3) the tax savings hypothesis. The results of our empirical analysis can be summarized as follows. First, putable convertible <b>issuers</b> are larger, less risky firms, having larger cash flows, smaller growth opportunities, and lower bankruptcy probabilities as compared to ordinary convertible <b>issuers.</b> Second, putable convertible <b>issuers</b> have lower preissue market valuations, more favorable announcement effects, and better postissue operating performance when compared to ordinary convertible <b>issuers.</b> Third, putable convertible <b>issuers</b> have better postissue long-run stock return performance as compared to ordinary convertible <b>issuers.</b> Finally, putable convertible <b>issuers</b> typically have greater tax obligations and better credit ratings than ordinary convertible <b>issuers.</b> Overall, {{the results of our}} univariate as well as multivariate analyses provide support for the asymmetric information and tax savings hypotheses, but little support for the risk-shifting hypothesis.

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 503 IPO <b>issuers</b> {{during the period of}} 2002 - 2008 in China, we {{investigate}} the relationship between pre-IPO earnings management and underwriter reputation for <b>issuers</b> of different ownership structure. We document a significantly negative relationship between underwriter reputation and pre-IPO earnings management only for the non state-owned enterprises (NSOE) <b>issuers</b> while no significant association is found for the state-owned enterprises (SOE) <b>issuers.</b> We argue that the results are driven by the fact that compared with SOE <b>issuers,</b> NSOE <b>issuers</b> have more incentives to signal their earnings quality to avoid adverse selection by the investors, and/or reputable underwriters are more influential over their clients in mitigating earnings management. We also find that for the NSOE new issue market, underwriter reputation is positively correlated with issuers’ post-IPO performance, even after controlling for reduced earnings management, indicating that prestigious underwriters can incrementally improve the post-IPO performance of the <b>issuers...</b>|$|R
40|$|We examine long-run stock {{returns and}} {{operating}} performance around firms' offerings of common stock, convertible debt, and straight debt from 1985 to 1990. We find that pre-issue abnormal returns are positive and significant for stock <b>issuers,</b> {{but not for}} convertible and straight debt <b>issuers.</b> The post-issue mean returns show that common stock and convertible debt <b>issuers</b> experience underperformance during the post-issue periods, but straight debt <b>issuers</b> do not. Consistent with these results, common stock <b>issuers</b> experience the best pre-issue operating performance among all three types of <b>issuers,</b> and operating performance declines during the post-issue periods for common stock and convertible debt <b>issuers.</b> Using a new approach in linear model estimations to correct heteroskedasticity and to adjust for finite sample, we find a positive relation between post-issue operating performance and issue-period stock price reactions. The results suggest that future operating performance is anticipated at the issue and that securities issues provide information on issuers' future performance.

In contrast to previous research, we also ask why some <b>issuers</b> possibly do expect to obtain an upwardly biased credit risk assessment from Fitch. The analysis reveals strong evidence of rating shopping behavior. In addition, <b>issuers</b> having an added incentive to press Fitch for a better rating are more likely to solicit a third rating.

40|$|Focusing on {{high-technology}} <b>issuers,</b> {{this study}} provides new evidence that managers strategically overinvest {{in research and development}} (R&D) projects prior to seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). It corroborates the theoretical prediction that managers with short-term valuation pressure tend to overinvest in long-term projects to elevate investors’ growth expectations (Bebchuk and Stole, 1993). I find that <b>issuers</b> with more intensive pre-SEO R&D expenditures exhibit lower productivity in terms of innovative output and operating performance following offerings, which is a primary manifestation of overinvestment. Such <b>issuers</b> also have higher price run-ups prior to offerings and lower long-term stock returns thereafter, suggesting that investors initially overestimate the future benefits of R&D expenditures but are subsequently disappointed by their low productivity. In additional analysis, I document that analysts make higher long-term growth forecasts prior to offerings for R&D intensive <b>issuers,</b> whereas such <b>issuers</b> are more likely to miss analysts’ sales forecasts subsequently relative to non-intensive <b>issuers.</b> This evidence suggests that analysts fare no better than investors in correctly anticipating the future benefits of pre-SEO R&D expenditures. Further analysis of managers’ disclosure of the intended use of proceeds indicates that R&D intensive <b>issuers</b> tend to provide more non-financial R&D information to reinforce investors’ growth expectations. Finally, I provide evidence that the documented strategic R&D investment behavior among seasoned <b>issuers</b> is not explained by managerial overconfidence...|$|R
