5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, <b>forensic</b> anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the <b>Forensic</b> Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for <b>Forensic</b> Anthropology, and the American Society of <b>Forensic</b> Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of <b>forensic</b> anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Once {{undergraduate}} education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, <b>forensic</b> anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking {{to pursue a}} <b>forensic</b> anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the <b>forensic</b> anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the <b>Forensic</b> Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by the American Board of <b>Forensic</b> Anthropology.|$|E

5|$|The professionalization of {{the field}} began soon after, during the 1950s and 1960s. This move coincided with the {{replacement}} of coroners with medical examiners in many locations around the country. It was during this time that the field of <b>forensic</b> anthropology gained recognition as a separate field within the American Academy of <b>Forensic</b> Sciences and the first <b>forensic</b> anthropology research facility and body farm was opened by William M. Bass. Public attention and interest in <b>forensic</b> anthropology began to increase around this time as <b>forensic</b> anthropologists started working on more high-profile cases. One of the major cases of the era involved anthropologist Charles Merbs who helped identify the victims murdered by Ed Gein.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} aspect {{of an investigation}} is divided into several sub-branches, relating {{to the type of}} digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics, <b>forensic</b> data analysis and mobile device forensics.

5|$|Typically, most <b>forensic</b> anthropologists perform <b>forensic</b> {{casework}} on {{a part-time}} basis, however there are individuals {{who work in}} the field full-time usually with federal or international agencies. <b>Forensic</b> anthropologists are usually employed in academia either at a university or a research facility.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question whether}} or not <b>forensics</b> is a cult. The paper states that <b>forensics</b> {{can be compared to}} the criteria listed on the "Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry Homepage " which says that a cult is a group that is unorthodox, esoteric, and has devotion to a person, object, or new set of ideas. In keeping with that definition, a part of the <b>forensics</b> indoctrination process is to learn the specialized language of <b>forensics.</b> Also, a cult may have a non-verifiable belief system,. and <b>forensics</b> coaches and students believe in things that cannot-be proven to some extent. However, when <b>forensics</b> leaders are examined under the critical lens provided by the criteria, <b>forensics</b> can be differentiated from cults. <b>Forensics</b> leaders are not above reproach, nor do they claim to speak for God. The paper concludes that <b>forensics</b> is not a cult, but it has many cult-like characteristics.

Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by <b>forensic</b> audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, <b>forensic</b> audio and ballistics expert Eddy B.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of <b>forensic</b> science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for <b>forensic</b> evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for <b>forensic</b> laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>forensic</b> fields, <b>forensic</b> anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical {{standards}} due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that <b>forensic</b> anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, web {{applications}} are popular targets for security attackers. Using specific security mechanisms, we can prevent or detect a security {{attack on a}} web application, but we cannot find out the criminal who has carried out the security attack. Being unable to trace back an attack, encourages hackers to launch new attacks on the same system. Web application <b>forensics</b> aims to trace back and attribute a web application security attack to its originator. This may significantly reduce the security attacks targeting a web application every day, and hence improve its security. The aim {{of this paper is}} to carry out a detailed overview about the web application <b>forensics.</b> First, we define the web applications <b>forensics,</b> and we present a taxonomic structure of the digital <b>forensics.</b> Then, we present the methodology of a web application <b>forensics</b> investigation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{employment}} of {{a patchwork of}} nonintegrated security products can only provide incomplete coverage, which cannot give the total panorama of the network misuse behavior.

However, the current network <b>forensics</b> system is confused with the network monitor system or sniffer system. It always is misconstrued to an only network traffic capture system. In this paper, we for the first time discuss the concept model of network <b>forensics</b> system, which can give guidance for the implementation of network <b>forensics</b> system and the formalization of the network <b>forensics</b> procedure, which is a principle element of the recognition between the law enforcement participation.

40|$|<b>Forensics</b> {{capability}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for the enterprise/network environment. Therefore, businesses need to find an optimised <b>forensics</b> solution that suits the high level business/forensics requirements.
