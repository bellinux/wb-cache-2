5|$|An {{important}} symbol {{among the}} Nri religion was the omu, a tender palm <b>frond,</b> used to sacralize and restrain. It {{was used as}} protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects; a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected. The influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond Nri, and this unique Igbo socio-political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns.|$|E
5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or <b>frond</b> with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the <b>frond</b> and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fronds</b> of {{tree ferns}} are usually {{very large and}} multiple-pinnated, {{but at least one}} type has entire (undivided) <b>fronds.</b> The <b>fronds</b> of tree ferns also exhibit circinate vernation, meaning the young <b>fronds</b> emerge in coils that uncurl as they grow.|$|R
50|$|The fern is a mat-shaped plant {{from which}} arise slender upright <b>fronds</b> {{composed}} of a single unbranched blade. Infertile <b>fronds</b> are 5-12 cm high and 1-2.5 mm wide, while the rarer fertile <b>fronds</b> are 8-20 cm high. Thinner than the infertile <b>fronds,</b> the fertile <b>fronds</b> are topped with a tiny combed reproductive growth. These are 3 to 16 mm long.|$|R
25|$|It {{is a small}} fern with pinnate <b>fronds,</b> {{growing in}} tufts, with a shiny reddish-brown stipe and rachis. The <b>fronds</b> are dimorphic, with long, erect, dark green fertile <b>fronds,</b> which are deciduous, and shorter, spreading, lighter green sterile <b>fronds,</b> which are evergreen.|$|R
25|$|The {{insignia}} {{is a small}} metallic palm <b>frond</b> pin or {{device that}} is worn on the ribbon of the Eagle Scout medal, on the Eagle Scout square knot or on the Eagle Scout badge.|$|E
25|$|The Star is an eight-pointed {{star with}} each arm bearing a {{representation}} of a fern <b>frond,</b> with the Order's badge superimposed in the centre. Grand Companions wear a gold star and Knight Companions wear a silver star.|$|E
25|$|Another craft, practiced mostly {{along the}} central and coastal areas, is that of palm <b>frond</b> weaving. With these fronds items like hats, bags, fans, mats, animal figures and more are made. A {{particular}} type of hat made in this fashion in Chilapa, Zitlala, Zapotitlán Tablas and Ahuacoutzingo is called a “costeño” hat.|$|E
50|$|Basket ferns are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} two types of <b>fronds,</b> fertile foliage <b>fronds</b> and sterile nest <b>fronds.</b> The dark green foliage <b>fronds</b> are large, 2 - 4 ft long, with elongated stalks. They are deeply lobed or pinnate, winged, and bear sori (structures producing and containing spores) on the bottom surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Bright green <b>fronds</b> {{grow from}} an {{underground}} rhizome. The plant spreads through division of this rhizome, {{and also by}} spores held under the <b>fronds.</b> <b>Fronds</b> die down in summer and return with the rain.|$|R
50|$|The sterile <b>fronds</b> are 40-60 cm long, and {{the fertile}} <b>fronds</b> 50-70 cm long.|$|R
25|$|While {{most of the}} world's ferns grow in {{tropical}} climates, New Zealand hosts an unusual number of ferns for a temperate country. These exhibit a variety of forms, from stereotypical feather-shaped tufted ferns and tree ferns to less typical filmy, leafy and climbing ferns. Both the koru, {{in the shape of}} an unfurling fern <b>frond,</b> and the silver fern are widely accepted symbols of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the more}} {{temperate}} parts of its range, A.resiliens may {{be confused with}} ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) and maidenhair spleenwort (A.trichomanes). Its stipe and rachis are darker and its pinnae smaller and more rounded than that of A.platyneuron, which also displays <b>frond</b> dimorphism with prostrate sterile fronds. The pinnae of A.resiliens are more widely spaced than those of A.trichomanes, which also lack the upward-pointing auricle, {{the texture of the}} leaf tissue is more leathery, and the stipe darker.|$|E
25|$|During Rotrou's absence his father, Geoffrey of Mortagne, died in 1099. On {{the first}} Sunday after {{returning}} to France, Rotrou {{paid a visit to}} the monastery of Nogent-le-Rotrou, a foundation of his family's and the location of his father tomb. There he asked to become a confrater (brother) of the Abbey of Cluny, Nogent's mother house, and to show his sincerity and prove the fulfillment of his Crusading vow he placed a charter confirming his predecessors' donations to the abbey and the palm <b>frond</b> brought back from Jerusalem on the altar.|$|E
50|$|A. nodosum {{has long}} tough and {{leathery}} frondsirregularly dichotomously branched <b>fronds</b> with large, egg-shaped air bladders set in series {{at regular intervals}} along the <b>fronds</b> and not stalked. The <b>fronds</b> can reach 2 m in length and are attached by a holdfast to rocks and boulders. The <b>fronds</b> are olive-green, olive-brown in color and somewhat compressed, but without a midrib.|$|R

50|$|Thread fern has a {{creeping}} {{and climbing}} habit. It has three {{different types of}} fronds: long climbing <b>fronds</b> with long pointed leaves, shorter creeping <b>fronds</b> with nearly round leaves, and fertile <b>fronds</b> with threadlike leaves that give the species its common name.|$|R
25|$|This apogamous {{reproduction}} {{is thought to}} account for the formation of the one suspected hybrid descendant of A.×trudellii. This specimen was collected in 1961 on a sandstone cliff at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park, and identified as A.pinnatifidum ×trudellii. This was hypothesized to be a pentaploid formed from spores of A.pinnatifidum and apogamous triploid spores of A.×trudellii, but this was not cytologically verified. The presumed hybrid has oblong pinnae, on stalks of intermediate length between its two parents. They are more widely spaced on the <b>frond</b> than in either parent.|$|E
25|$|Walthamstow {{was home}} to the popular 1990s boy band East 17, who named {{themselves}} after the area's postal code E17, and titled their debut album Walthamstow. The indie rock band The Rifles are from the area as was Jimmy Ray. Ray {{grew up in the}} Lloyd Park area and attended Winns primary, and Sidney Chaplin and McEntee secondary schools. In the early 1990s he performed at various E17 venues, including the Royal Standard, as part of local pop group 'The Cutting Room'. Ray later had solo hits in the UK and US. It is home to the band The Bevis <b>Frond.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most ferns have {{rhizomes}} with no vertical stem. The {{exception is}} tree ferns, with vertical stems {{up to about}} 20 metres. The stem anatomy of ferns {{is more complicated than}} that of dicots because fern stems often have one or more leaf gaps in cross section. A leaf gap is where the vascular tissue branches off to a <b>frond.</b> In cross section, the vascular tissue does not form a complete cylinder where a leaf gap occurs. Fern stems may have solenosteles or dictyosteles or variations of them. Many fern stems have phloem tissue {{on both sides of the}} xylem in cross-section.|$|E
50|$|Platycerium sporophytes (adult plants) have tufted roots {{growing from}} a short rhizome that bears {{two types of}} <b>fronds,</b> basal and fertile <b>fronds.</b> Basal <b>fronds</b> are sterile, shield or kidney shaped and {{laminate}} against the tree and protect the fern's roots from damage and desiccation. In some Platycerium species the top margin of these <b>fronds</b> forms an open crown of lobes and thereby catches falling forest litter and water.|$|R
50|$|Sterile nest <b>fronds</b> are rounded shallowly-lobed reddish-brown <b>fronds</b> {{overlapping}} each other. They bear no sori {{and form}} a 'basket' characteristic of the genus. The fertile <b>fronds</b> are larger and deeply lobed. They bear 1 to 3 sori arranged {{on both sides of}} the central rib.|$|R
50|$|Mabberley, in 2008, defined this {{subfamily}} in a {{very broad}} sense, including all of Polypodiaceae except for the Platycerioideae (Platycerium and Pyrrosia) and the grammitid ferns, which he placed in Grammitidaceae. He distinguished this subfamily from the platycerioids {{by the absence of}} stellate hairs on the <b>fronds.</b> He subdivided it into six tribes, Drynarieae (<b>fronds</b> dimorphic; Aglaomorpha and Drynaria), Selligueeae (<b>fronds</b> monomorphic, with opaque scales on the stem; Selliguea), Lepisoreae (<b>fronds</b> monomorphic, with clathrate scales and thick exospore; Belvisia and Lepisorus), Microsoreae (<b>fronds</b> monomorphic, with clathrate scales and thin exospore), Polypodieae (Pecluma and Polypodium), and Loxogrammeae (lacking internal sclerenchyma above roots; Loxogramme).|$|R
25|$|This species {{typically}} inhabits wooded areas near permanent {{water sources}} or coastal habitats with Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) or palm trees. In the southeastern United States, L. intermedius distribution almost always coincides with Spanish moss, which they use for both roost and maternity sites. Bats roost within the Spanish moss itself or beneath the dead hanging fronds of fan palm trees. A single palm tree or live oak tree draped in Spanish moss may {{be home to}} several individuals year-round, and multiple pregnant and lactating females may form a maternity colony, despite the solitary nature of most Lasiurine bats. One study found bats favored Sand live oaks (Quercus geminata) with an average roost height of 2.23 m above the ground and 1.57 m above the nearest vegetation. The average length of a roost was 0.98 m and average width was 0.44 m. Clumps of Spanish moss used for roosting sites were 2-3 times larger than clumps of un-used Spanish moss in the area. All roosts were within 1 m of the sandy road and less than 11 m from a lake. These bats frequently changed their roost site. In August 2003, a male northern yellow bat was found roosting {{on the underside of}} a partially dead <b>frond</b> of cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) along the edge of Lake August in a residential lawn in Florida. The cryptic coloration of this species makes it difficult to spot on the brown <b>frond</b> of a palm.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium platyneuron (syn. Asplenium ebeneum), {{commonly}} known as ebony spleenwort or brownstem spleenwort, is a fern native to North America east of the Rocky Mountains and to South Africa. It takes its common name from its dark, reddish-brown, glossy stipe and rachis (stem and leaf axis), which bear a once-divided, pinnate leaf. The fertile fronds, which die off in the winter, are darker green and stand upright, while the sterile fronds are evergreen and lie flat on the ground. An auricle {{at the base of}} each pinna points towards the tip of the <b>frond.</b> The dimorphic fronds and alternate, rather than opposite, pinnae distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed spleenwort.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} rare hybrids {{resemble}} A.×ebenoides. A.×hendersonii, once suggested {{to be the}} same species, has longer sori, more obtuse pinnae, and a scaly stipe. The unnamed triploid backcross of A.×ebenoides with A.rhizophyllum was accidentally generated in culture in 1956, and subsequently identified with a fern collected in West Virginia in 1946, previously identified as an aberrant A.×ebenoides. This hybrid is intermediate between its parents, bearing lobes in the basal part of the <b>frond</b> only, and with purple color extending up the rachis but not the stipe. A.×crucibuli, an artificial hybrid between A.platyneuron and the Asian walking fern, A.ruprechtii, has narrower blades, deeply pinnatifid in the middle and becoming pinnate at the base.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×trudellii {{is a small}} fern, with {{evergreen}} <b>fronds</b> {{growing in}} tufts. It is similar to A.pinnatifidum, with a triangular leaf blade, pinnatifid (lobed) in the upper part, with a long, drawn-out tip. The <b>fronds</b> are monomorphic, showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile <b>fronds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} Gu-Sui-Bu. It {{is native to}} East Asia. Sterile nest <b>fronds</b> are rounded shallowly-lobed reddish-brown <b>fronds</b> {{overlapping}} each other. The fertile <b>fronds</b> are larger and deeply lobed. They bear 1 to 3 sori arranged {{on both sides of}} the central rib. Formerly known as Drynaria fortunei.|$|R
50|$|Asplenium × trudellii {{is a small}} fern, with {{evergreen}} <b>fronds</b> {{growing in}} tufts. It is similar to A. pinnatifidum, with a triangular leaf blade, pinnatifid (lobed) in the upper part, with a long, drawn-out tip. The <b>fronds</b> are monomorphic, showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile <b>fronds.</b>|$|R
25|$|The species most {{similar to}} Asplenium platyneuron is the black-stemmed spleenwort, A.resiliens. However, this stipe {{of this species}} is darker, and the pinnae are opposite, rather than alternate, along the rachis. Neither black-stemmed spleenwort nor the other pinnate American spleenworts have dimorphic fertile and sterile fronds. It might be {{confused}} with a young Christmas fern, Polystichum acrostichoides, but that species is generally much larger and has a green, scaly stipe and rachis. It {{is very similar to}} Boydston's spleenwort, Asplenium × boydstoniae, a backcross with Tutwiler's spleenwort, Asplenium tutwilerae; however, Boydston's spleenwort has an elongated, acute <b>frond</b> tip similar to that of Tutwiler's spleenwort. Confusion with a Boydston's spleenwort is effectively impossible, as Boydston's spleenwort only grows wild at one location on Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds {{is one of}} several unusual adaptations for reproduction in this species. The buds form near the base of the stipe, and when covered with soil, can grow into new individuals as the <b>frond</b> that bore them dies. Ebony spleenwort is also well-adapted to propagate by spores: the upright sterile fronds help the spores enter the airstream for long-distance dispersal, and a low genetic load allows spores that have grown into a gametophyte to self-fertilize {{with a high degree of}} success. This dispersal ability seems to have helped the species spread rapidly in the Great Lakes region in the late 20th century. Long-distance dispersal may also explain its naturalized appearance in South Africa; the same mechanism may have given rise to an isolated population found in Slovakia in 2009, its first known occurrence in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The fan and {{fly-whisk}} are items used {{to comfort}} and cool, an important accessory for a divine king {{especially in a}} tropical country. The Royal Fan (พัดวาลวิชนี) was created by order of King Rama I. The fan is gilded with gold, the handle enamelled in green and red. Traditionally a fan was made by bending a talipot palm's <b>frond</b> at a right angle; the royal fan mimics this traditional form. The Royal Fly-whisk of the yak's tail (พระแส้หางจามรี) {{was made in the}} reign of King Rama IV to augment the five items of the regalia. Evidently associated with the same idea of divine comfort as the fan, it is actually derived from the ancient chāmara of India. According to tradition, the fly-whisk was used by the king to repel any maleficent forces that might bring discomfort to his subjects. The hair on the royal fly-whisk has since been replaced by those of a white elephant.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{deciduous}} {{herbaceous plant}} which produces separate fertile and sterile <b>fronds.</b> The sterile <b>fronds</b> are spreading, up to 80-100 cm tall, bipinnate, with pinnae 20-30 cm long and pinnules 4-6 cm long and 1.5-2 cm broad; the fertile <b>fronds</b> are erect and shorter, 20-50 cm tall.|$|R
25|$|Asplenium ×kentuckiense {{is a small}} fern, whose <b>fronds</b> grow in upright, {{spreading}} tufts. The stem is a shiny dark brown, {{the color}} extending well into the leaf blade. The blades are cut into pinnae near the base, which diminish into lobes in the upper part and eventually to teeth {{on the sides of}} a long, drawn-out tip. The <b>fronds</b> are dimorphic, with the fertile <b>fronds</b> much longer and of a different shape than the sterile <b>fronds.</b>|$|R
