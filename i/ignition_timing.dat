25|$|A fuel with {{a higher}} octane rating is less prone to {{knocking}} (extremely rapid and spontaneous combustion by compression) and the control system of any modern car engine {{can take advantage of}} this by adjusting the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing.</b> This will improve energy efficiency, leading to a better fuel economy than the comparisons of energy content different fuels indicate. By increasing the compression ratio, further gains in fuel economy, power and torque can be achieved. Conversely, a fuel with lower octane rating is more prone to knocking and will lower efficiency. Knocking can also cause engine damage. Engines designed to run on 87 octane will not have any additional power/fuel economy from being operated with higher octane fuel.|$|E

Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch.

40|$|One way {{to extend}} the lean-burn limit of a natural gas engine is by {{addition}} of hydrogen to the primary fuel. This paper presents measurements made on a one-cylinder, 1. 6 - liter natural gas engine. Two combustion chambers, one slow and one fast burning, were tested with various amounts of hydrogen (0, 5, 10 and 15 %-vol) added to natural gas. Three operating points were investigated for each combustion chamber and each hydrogen content level; idle, part load (5 bar IMEP) and 13 bar IMEP (simulated turbocharging). Air/fuel ratio was varied between stoichiometric and the lean limit. For each operating point, a range of <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> were tested to find maximum brake torque (MBT) and/or knock. Heat-release rate calculations were made {{in order to assess}} the influence of hydrogen addition on burn rate.

40|$|Spray H (baseline n-heptane) {{cases of}} Engine Combustion Network (ECN) are {{investigated}} with the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) method. In the FGM method, all thermo-chemical properties are stored {{as a function}} of controlling variables, here the mixture fraction and the progress variable. Two approaches are used to construct the FGM tables, igniting counterflow diffusion flamelets (ICDF) and homogeneous reactors (HR). To capture ignition delay times in a reliable way, a sensitivity study is performed to determine the optimal FGM table properties. It is observed that using quadratic discretization in progress variable space, i. e. more points in early stages of chemistry, is essential to predict accurate <b>ignition</b> <b>timings.</b> Once quadratic spacing is applied, the ignition delay time results show good correlation with those of experiments. This is observed with both ICDF- and HR-based FGM tables. The similarity between ignition delay results of two approaches indicates that the effect of mixing on chemistry is low and the diffusion process plays a minor role at elevated ambient conditions such as in conventional diesel engines. Finally, the effect of including the mixture fraction variance is analyzed and the impact is found mainly on the lift-off length. The ignition delay is hardly affecte...|$|R

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} model year 1999, an {{increasing}} number of vehicles in the world are manufactured with engines that can run on any fuel from 0% ethanol up to 100% ethanol without modification. Many cars and light trucks (a class containing minivans, SUVs and pickup trucks) are designed to be flexible-fuel vehicles using ethanol blends up to 85% (E85) in North America and Europe, and up to 100% (E100) in Brazil. In older model years, their engine systems contained alcohol sensors in the fuel and/or oxygen sensors in the exhaust that provide input to the engine control computer to adjust the fuel injection to achieve stochiometric (no residual fuel or free oxygen in the exhaust) air-to-fuel ratio for any fuel mix. In newer models, the alcohol sensors have been removed, with the computer using only oxygen and airflow sensor feedback to estimate alcohol content. The engine control computer can also adjust (advance) the <b>ignition</b> <b>timing</b> to achieve a higher output without pre-ignition when it predicts that higher alcohol percentages are present in the fuel being burned.

For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the fuel filler has to be depressurized before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine.

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is {{the third}} {{alternative}} for combustion in the reciprocating engine. Here a homogeneous charge is used as in a spark-ignited engine, but the charge is compressed to autoignition as in a diesel. The main difference compared with the Spark Ignition (SI) engine {{is the lack of}} flame propagation and hence the independence from turbulence. Compared with the diesel engine, HCCI has a homogeneous charge and hence no problems associated with soot and NOdx formation. Earlier research on HCCI showed high efficiency and very low amounts of NOdx, but HC and CO were higher than in SI mode. It was not possible to achieve high IMEP values with HCCI, the limit being 5 bar. Supercharging is one way to dramatically increase IMEP. The influence of supercharging on HCCI was therefore experimentally investigated. Three different fuels were used during the experiments: iso-octane, ethanol and natural gas. Two different compression ratios were used, 17 : 1 and 19 : 1. The inlet pressure conditions were set to give 0, 1, or 2 bar of boost pressure. The highest attainable IMEP was 14 bar using natural gas as fuel at the lower compression ratio. The limit in achieving even higher IMEP was set by the high rate of combustion and a high peak pressure. Numerical calculations of the HCCI process have been performed for natural gas as fuel. The calculated <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> agreed well with the experimental findings. The numerical solution is, however, very sensitive to the composition of the natural gas...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} thesis describes planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) {{experiments that}} investigate bulk flame quenching in the lean periphery of a stratified fuel cloud during light-load {{operation of a}} direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. PLIF of both 3 -pentanone doped into the fuel (iso-octane) and OH present naturally in the combustion products were imaged on an intensified CCD camera. The OH images show the progression of the flame front {{and the expansion of}} the product zone. The 3 -pentanone images provide visualization of the progression of the flame front through the consumption of fuel, as well as allowing quantification of the local equivalence ratio in the stratified, unburned mixture. Under stratified operating conditions, using an overall equivalence ratio of ? = 0. 3 and an engine speed of 600 rpm, quenching of the flame in the lean periphery of the fuel cloud was observed. The combustion product zone (OH fluorescence) showed a period of rapid growth shortly after ignition. The flame front propagation stopped before the edge of the piston bowl, and the product zone ceased expansion. Images of the fuel region (3 -pentanone fluorescence) demonstrate the consumption of the fuel, the propagation and stalling of the flame front, and a region of unburned fuel present long after the end of heat release (as late as 70 ÔøΩ ATDC). Advancing the combustion phasing by varying the injection and <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> within a window of acceptable combustion characteristics was not sufficient to alleviate quenching. However, quenching was alleviated when the air intake pressure was reduced to 69 kPa while the mass of injected ii fuel was held constant.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} determine the effects of substantial spark retard on engine combustion, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, feed gas enthalpy, and catalyst light-off. Engine experiments were conducted at cold engine conditions for various <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> and air/ fuel ratios. Chemical and thermal energy of the exhaust gas was tracked from cylinder-exit to the catalytic converter inlet using a variety of experimental techniques. Time-resolved exhaust port and exhaust runner hydrocarbon concentrations were converted to an exhaust HC mass flow rate and compared to time-averaged downstream HC levels. Quenching experiments quantified cylinder-exit HC emissions by rapidly cooling exhaust gas at the valve seats, effectively freezing HC oxidation reactions. Combustion stability was observed to decrease as the phasing of the 50 % mass fraction burned location occurred later in the expansion stroke. A thermodynamic burn rate analysis indicated combustion was complete by exhaust valve opening with spark timings as late as 200 after top-dead-center (ATDC). Engine operation with a relative air/fuel ratio 10 % lean of stoichiometric resulted in the lowest observed tailpipe-out HC emissions. Retarded spark timings increased exhaust system oxidation, with port HC oxidation ranging from 15 % to 37 % with additional HC reductions (40 - 50 %) in the runner for ATDC spark timings. Catalyst light-off times were reduced by 5 seconds and cumulative catalytic converter-in HC emissions were reduced by 44 % prior to light-off. A phenomenological model of exhaust system oxidation was developed to provide insight into HC burn-up with late combustion phasing. (cont.) A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was coupled with an exhaust flow model and exhaust thermal model. The hydrocarbon tracking and exhaust gas quenching experiments provided initial conditions for a reacting plug flow model. The predicted exhaust HC reaction rates were found to be strongly coupled with exhaust gas temperature and the hydrocarbon species used to represent unburned fuel.

40|$|Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines {{have the}} {{potential}} to achieve diesel-like fuel efficiency while virtually eliminating NOx and soot emissions. Realizing the full fuel economy potential of the gasoline HCCI engine hinges upon our ability to expand the operating range. Due to the strong dependence of HCCI combustion to in-cylinder thermal conditions, understanding the effects of changes in the thermal boundary of the combustion chamber is essential for addressing combustion stability and HCCI operating limits. Combustion chamber deposits (CCD) are known to increase the propensity of a conventional spark-ignition engine to knock through an increase in local wall temperature, therefore it is expected they would affect the main combustion event in an HCCI engine. The objective of this work is to determine the effect of CCD on HCCI combustion. This requires a thorough understanding of the effects of deposits on heat transfer to the chamber walls. This experimental investigation was performed using a gasoline fueled single cylinder research engine. Combustion analysis is performed based on in-cylinder pressure measurements and combustion chamber wall heat transfer effects are characterized through the use of fast response thermocouples. Using these measurements, it was found that there is a clear relationship between instantaneous peak temperature phasing measured below the CCD layer and the layer thickness. Based on these findings, a methodology for calculating the thermal diffusivity of the deposit layer was developed, specific for HCCI engines. These measurements were also used to develop the Lead-Corrector method, which uses numerical finite-difference based calculation of the deposit layer instantaneous surface temperature to give insight into the direct effects of CCD on chamber heat loss. It was found that the effect of deposit formation was of a much greater magnitude on HCCI combustion than on standard combustion modes. Specifically, it was found that reduced heat loss during intake and compression resulted in earlier <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> while higher wall temperature swings during heat release resulted in shorter burn duration of the peripheral regions of the air/fuel charge.

Additional simulations were performed using an optimized gasoline surrogate mechanism from RWTH Aachen University. Validations of the simulated data were also performed with experimental results from an IQT at KAUST. For simulation of n-dodecane in the CVCC, two n-dodecane kinetic models from the literature were utilized. The primary {{aim of this study}} is to test the ability of TSL to replicate <b>ignition</b> <b>timings</b> in the IQT and the CVCC. The agreement between the model and the experiment is acceptable except for isooctane in the IQT and n-heptane and n-dodecane in the CVCC. The ability of the simulations to replicate observable trends in ignition delay times with regard to changes in ambient temperature and pressure allows the model to provide insights into the reactions contributing towards ignition. Thus, the TSL model was further employed to investigate the physical and chemical processes responsible for controlling the overall ignition under various conditions. The effects of exothermicity, ambient pressure, and ambient oxygen concentration on first stage ignition were also studied. Increasing ambient pressure and oxygen concentration was found to shorten the overall ignition delay time, but does not affect the timing of the first stage ignition. Additionally, the temperature at the end of the first stage ignition was found to increase at higher ambient pressure and oxygen concentration. Sensitivity analysis was performed using the TSL model to elucidate the reactions that control the overall ignition process.
