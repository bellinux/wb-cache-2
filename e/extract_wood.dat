Although plethodontid salamanders are sensitive to microclimate changes, their role as ecological indicators rarely have been evaluated quantitatively. Our case studies of CWD and salamanders in western and eastern forests demonstrated effects of species, region and spatial scale on the existence and strength of relationships between plethodontid species and a “critical” microhabitat variable. Oregon slender salamanders (Batrachoseps wrighti) were more strongly associated with abundance of CWD in managed second growth forests than ensatina salamanders (Ensatina eschscholtzii).

In this thesis I present my findings from {{various aspects of the}} crows’ behavioural ecology, morphology and cognition, contributing to our understanding of how this fascinating tool-use behaviour might have evolved. My studies in the field reveal new types of tool manufacture and foraging behaviour that help to build up a complete picture of the ecological importance of tool-use to wild crows. Additionally I demonstrate the subtlety and skill required to <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> boring beetle larvae from their burrows, accounting for the slow development of tool-use proficiency in juvenile crows. Further work reveals how their unique visual field combines with a peculiarly straight bill to facilitate tool-use; perhaps the only evidence outside of the hominid hand for tool-use specific morphology. Recent studies suggest Corvus species are behaviourally and cognitively predisposed to become tool-users, however, through multiple lines of enquiry this thesis highlights the costs that New Caledonian crows bear in order to become successful tool-users. The unique ecological conditions in New Caledonia are likely to have made this costly form of foraging possible, helping to explain why tool-use is so rarely observed in other animals...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Throughout most of industrialised history, forests {{have been}} worth more felled than standing. Countries in the {{developed}} world, including Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada and Europe have clear-felled around half of the world's primary forests to plant agricultural crops, create urban centres, <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> for construction or burn timber as fuel. In response to the international demand for timber and timber products, most deforestation {{in the twentieth century}} has occurred in developing countries, which collectively harbour around half of the world's remaining natural forest. In the twenty-first century, predictions of global warming have led to a new way of seeing forests as repositories of carbon. In the climate change 'crisis', the maintenance of existing forests as well as increasing forest coverage is touted to make an important contribution to the mitigation of global warming, but this potential is yet to be realised (Nabuurs et al. 2007; Capoor and Ambrosi 2008).

30|$|X-ray wood {{nondestructive}} testing {{is an effective}} method for accessing to internal information of wood. Comparing with other conventional wood {{nondestructive testing}}, such as appearance judgment, acoustic emission testing, ultrasonic testing, microwave testing, and stress wave testing, this method can acquire distinct wood internal structure images by an X-ray imaging system. Through the wood images, the positions of wood defects can be easily identified; the scales of the defects can be roughly estimated. Furthermore, we can make use of computer technology to automatically <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> defects information from the images for automatically identifying defects characteristics such as areas, types, and severity, which can help making the optimal sawing solution. However, extracting accurate defects information depends on the accurate boundary detection. There are many edge detection algorithms. Most previous edge detection algorithms used first-order derivative operators such as the Sobel edge operator [1, 2], the Roberts edge operator, and the Prewitt edge operator [3]. If a pixel point is on the boundary, its neighborhood will be a zone of transition. The Laplacian operator [4] is a second-order derivative operator and is used to detect boundary at locations of the zero crossing. The Canny operator [5, 6], another gradient operator, is used to determine a class of optimal filter for different types of boundaries. All these operators detect boundary points by gray gradient change of the image pixels in the neighborhood; the disadvantage of these methods are sensitive to noise.|$|E

40|$|Estimating whole-plant {{water use}} in trees {{requires}} reliable and accurate methods. Measuring sap velocity and extrapolating to tree water use {{is seen as}} the most commonly used. However, deducing the tree water use from sap velocity requires an estimate of the sapwood area. This estimate is the highest cause of uncertainty, and can reach more than 50 % of the uncertainty in the estimate of water use per day. Here, we investigate the possibility of using Electrical Resistivity Tomography to evaluate the sapwood area distribution in a plantation of Pinus elliottii. Electric resistivity tomographs of Pinus elliottii show a very typical pattern of electrical resistivity, which is highly correlated to sapwood and heartwood distribution. To identify the key factors controlling the variation of electrical resistivity, cross sections at breast height for ten trees have been monitored with electrical resistivity tomography. Trees have been cut down after the experiment to identify the heartwood/sapwood boundaries and to <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> and sap samples. pH, electrolyte concentration and wood moisture content have then been analysed for these samples. Results show that the heartwood/sapwood patterns are highly correlated with electrical resistivity, and that the wood moisture content is the most influencing factor controlling the variability of the patterns. These results show that electric resistivity tomography {{could be used as a}} powerful tool to identify the sapwood area, and thus be used in combination with sapflow sensors to map tree water use at stand scale. However, if Pinus elliottii shows typical patterns, further work is needed to identify to see if there are species - specific characterictics as shown in previous works (, electrolyte gradients from the bark to the heartwood). Also, patterns of high resistivity in between needles positions, which are not correlated with either wood moisture content or sapwood, appear to be artifacts. Thus, inversion methods have also to be improved to take into account these measurements issues...|$|E

40|$|Rummaging the ?queer? smelling attic of his parental home, a space {{filled with}} ?big trunks, broken furniture, old books, old clothes, and {{odds and ends}} of all sorts,? fifteen-year-old Forrest Reid hit upon a {{treasure}} that would furnish his listless life with a ?fresh stimulus?: stacks of ivory yellowed periodicals dating from the 1860 s, the decade prior to his birth. As he leafed through back numbers of Good Words, Cornhill, Quiver, Argosy and Once a Week, young Reid realised that here was the ?nucleus of a real collection? ? not of stories, essays or poems, but of the images that went with them. He was conscious that {{the removal of the}} illustrations from the magazines might be frowned upon as an act of vandalism; so, he secretly busied himself in the ?sunless pallor of the skylight? or even by candlelight to <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> engravings that, as he recalled in his 1926 autobiography Apostate, ?possessed an increasing fascination? for him: ?They accepted life as it was and turned it into beauty; they invested the most homely material with a delicate and poetic charm. ? Reid had never been to a picture gallery ? and here was a chance to assemble one from the ?spoils of the lumber-room?. From the start, Reid?s collecting was studious and methodical: ?I cut out and mounted my pictures, carefully dating each drawing, and writing its title {{at the foot of the}} board, and the title of the magazine in which found it? (177). The use of possessive is telling here. By appropriating the images, by releasing them from the fictions they were designed to accompany and separating them from the publications they were intended to promote, the collector changed their value along with their meaning. Reid was not alone in this endeavour. Aficionados like Gleeson White and Harold Thomas Hartley concurred that magazine illustrations were well worth collecting, an engagement that elevated the ephemeral to the status of art or at least recognised its potentialities as art. This chapter examines the motives, methods, achievements and influences of those pioneer collectors ? their approaches and attitudes toward their pursuit as well as their own role and responsibilities ? and considers them in relation to the collector?s market from the 1860 s to the present day...|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{renewable}} materials has intensified in recent years. Pulp and paper mill process streams contain a number of potential compounds {{which could be used}} in biofuel production and as raw materials in the chemical, food and pharmaceutical industries. Prior to utilization, these compounds require separation from other compounds present in the process stream. One feasible separation technique is membrane filtration but to some extent, fouling still limits its implementation in pulp and paper mill applications. To mitigate fouling and its effects, foulants and their fouling mechanisms need to be well understood. This thesis evaluates fouling in filtration of pulp and paper mill process streams by means of polysaccharide model substance filtrations and by development of a procedure to analyze and identify potential foulants, i. e. wood extractives and carbohydrates, from fouled membranes. The model solution filtration results demonstrate that each polysaccharide has its own fouling mechanism, which also depends on the membrane characteristics. Polysaccharides may foul the membranes by adsorption and/or by gel/cake layer formation on the membrane surface. Moreover, the polysaccharides interact, which makes fouling evaluation of certain compound groups very challenging. Novel methods to identify wood extractive and polysaccharide foulants are developed in this thesis. The results show {{that it is possible to}} extract and identify wood extractives from membranes fouled in filtration of pulp and paper millstreams. The most effective solvent was found to be acetone:water (9 : 1 v/v) because it extracted both lipophilic extractives and lignans at high amounts from the fouled membranes and it was also non-destructive for the membrane materials. One hour of extraction was enough to <b>extract</b> <b>wood</b> extractives at high amounts for membrane samples with an area of 0. 008 m 2. If only qualitative knowledge of wood extractives is needed a simplified extraction procedure can be used. Adsorption was the main fouling mechanism in extractives-induced fouling and dissolved fatty and resin acids were mostly the reason for the fouling; colloidal fouling was negligible. Both process water and membrane characteristics affected extractives-induced fouling. In general, the more hydrophilic regenerated cellulose (RC) membrane fouled less that the more hydrophobic polyethersulfone (PES) and polyamide (PA) membranes independent of the process water used. Monosaccharide and uronic acid units could also be identified from the fouled synthetic polymeric membranes. It was impossible to analyze all monosaccharide units from the RC membrane because the analysis result obtained contained degraded membrane material. One of the fouling mechanisms of carbohydrates was adsorption. Carbohydrates were not potential adsorptive foulants to the sameextent as wood extractives because their amount in the fouled membranes was found to be significantly lower than the amount of wood extractives...|$|E
