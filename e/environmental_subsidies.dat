40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{environment}} protection gained much more significance {{in designing the}} economic policies in the European Union (EU) countries. There are many economic and policy differences between the European countries, despite of the harmonization process inside the EU area. The path of implementation of the environmental tax reforms in the EU countries differs greatly {{from one country to}} another and the effects of such taxation in the economic and environmental areas are manifold. The authors of this paper have agreed to undertake the task of testing the double dividend hypothesis of the environmental taxation in Romania (an energy-intensive country) versus the EU area as a whole, using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) techniques and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimations. Our findings show that this hypothesis is validated neither in Romania (in the economic growth area) nor in the EU area as a whole (in the unemployment area). Therefore, Romania cannot increase the level of the environmental tax for supporting economic growth, but it can grant <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> for decreasing the emissions and supporting the economic growth.

To analyze the usefulness of the tax-subsidy combination, we review conceptual considerations regarding its implementation and practical considerations regarding its actual use throughout the world. While the tax-subsidy combination is increasingly being used, in the form of a deposit-refund system, we argue that more flexible interpretations are important to explore. The two parts of such a policy do not have to apply to the same side of the market. The tax and subsidy do not have to equal one another, and they can apply to different goods altogether. Compared to the Pigovian tax, a two-part instrument may be easier to enforce, may be easier to enact, and can still force the market to recognize the social cost of disposal. ...|$|R

Like others, we show that the subsidy succeeds in reducing environmental damage only when the substitution effect (the reduction in pollution associated with the clean technology) exceeds the output effect (the extent that the subsidy increases output). Here, we add product differentiation and diffusion dynamics. When the substitution effect dominates, environmental damage decreases monotonically during the diffusion process. The extent of technology diffusion (the degree to which clean technology replaces dirty) is decreasing in the degree of product differentiation. Further, as products become closer substitutes, {{it is more likely that}} the subsidy will reduce environmental damage. Finally, the subsidy for clean technology will spill over to the remaining dirty producers, increasing their profit as well. In a free-entry equilibrium, the subsidy decreases pollution when product differentiation is low compared to the relative pollution intensity of the clean technology. ...|$|E

It is clear that subsidies on clean energy production and consumption are needed to correct market failures and to promote legitimate policy goals such as contributing to sustainable development through the scale up of clean energy, including expanding its trade. 2 However, experience has shown that support schemes for clean energy by their nature and design make them sensitive to WTO dispute settlement. Much more harmful subsidies on fossil fuels, on the other hand, are omnipresent yet often escape being addressed in the multilateral trading system. The contribution will draw upon the examples of ‘energy dual pricing’ and Feed-In Tariffs (FITs).

Next, we compare the environmental cost of the different methods of producing electricity.

40|$|We apply a {{model of}} an {{environmentally}} differentiated duopoly {{to the analysis of}} environmental policy {{in the form of a}} subsidy/tax on consumers based on emission levels of products. More specifically, we consider environmental and welfare effects of subsidizing consumers who purchase environmental-friendly goods such as hybrid vehicles. Focusing on types of market coverage by heterogeneous consumers, we examine the issue in the cases of a Bertrand and a Cournot duopoly. In the case of full market coverage with a Bertrand duopoly, an <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidy</b> improves the environment and is socially optimal. However, in the case of partial market coverage, irrespective of mode of competition, the optimal policy depends on the magnitude of the marginal social valuation of environmental damage.

40|$|Agricultural {{agencies}} have long offered agri-environmental payments that are inadequate to achieve water quality goals, and many state water quality agencies are considering point-nonpoint trading {{to achieve the}} needed pollution reductions. This analysis considers both targeted and nontargeted agri-environmental payment schemes, along with a trading program which is not spatially targeted. The degree of improved performance among these policies is found to depend on whether the programs are coordinated or not, whether double-dipping (i. e., when farmers are paid twice—once by each program—to undertake particular pollution control actions) is allowed, and whether the agri-environ-mental payments are targeted. Under coordination, efficiency gains only occur with double-dipping, so that both programs jointly influence farmers ’ marginal decisions. Without coordination, double-dipping may increase or decrease efficiency, {{depending on how the}} agri-environmental policy is targeted. Finally, double-dipping may not solely benefit farmers, but can result in a transfer of agri-cultural subsidies to point sources.

50|$|The basic {{conceptualization}} of nature {{from the perspective}} of environmental economics is that manufactured capital {{can be used as a}} substitute for natural capital. The definition of PES provided by environmental economics is the most popular: a voluntary transaction between a service buyer and service seller that takes place on the condition that either a specific ecosystem service is provided or land is used in a way to secure that service. This definition is directly related to the Coase theorem, upon which PES is strongly based from the environmental economics perspective, which states that in a competitive market, in the absence of transaction costs and in the presence of clear property rights, direct negotiation between private parties can lead to efficient outcomes. However, in reality, transaction costs are virtually always present and private parties cannot always reach agreements on their own. One of the main reasons is lack of sustained financing, which often leads governments to provide some type of funding assistance. The environmental economics theorists acknowledge that PES systems can resemble an <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidy,</b> complicating the strict Coasian backing.|$|R

40|$|State Aid in the Interface of Law and Politics: Environmental Protection as an Example Kristian Siikavirta In {{this study}} {{subsidies}} are analysed {{as an instrument}} for environmental protection. The main {{focus is on the}} national legal rules regulating the use of subsidies and also on the actual use of subsidies for environmental protection in Finland. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> for agriculture are not covered. The aim is to clarify the legal characteristics of subsidies in general and the <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> in particular. Secondly legal principles found are analysed in order to uncover their theoretical appropriateness as well as their practical effects when working with environmental policy which primary tools are legal oblications given by public authorities. The analysis is based on a functional approach. The chain of activities needed when subsidies are used is developed. It contains following activities namely discovering the problem, setting the targets, choosing the instruments, establishing the subsidy programs, distributing the benefits, monitoring effects and firm level use of the subsidies, and evaluating the effects for future improvement. First this study focuses on the legal rules regulating the establishment and planning of a subsidy program. Secondly is analysed the law regulating the distribution of the benefits to firms by the public authorities. This analysis sheds light on the dynamics between these the seemingly unconnected phases and gives the means to discover the features of good legal rules and regulation. The theoretical background used to uncover the social connections of the <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> is, in the first instance, the economic theory of environmental protection. That normative theory provides criteria for the evaluation of subsidies as an environmental policy instrument and also for the evaluation of the legal rules and regulation on <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The establishment of actual subsidy programs and set goals can be analysed and explained through some basic ideas from public choice theory and from the related interest group theory. The administrative procedure governing the distribution of subsidies can be analysed by applying the economic theory of administrative law (based on transaction costs) and also by using the principal agent theory founded on the idea of uncertain information between the legislator and public authorities. The common theme of these different theories is the analysis of the decision-making process of public authorities on the different levels of society. The common to that decision-making setting is the question how to build a good environmental subsidy program and how to distribute the funds to beneficiary firms and industries in an efficient and justified way. These theories helps to evaluate the true functioning of legal rules and regulation. This aim could not be achieved through research carried out only using traditional legal dogmatics. The selected versatile theoretical structure offer some new arguments to legal argumentation. In this study subsidies are defined widely as all acts of state or public power which are meant to give persons or organisations positive economic incentives to act according to the legislators will. The European Union legislation, namely the treaty establishing the European Community article 87 (1), makes a division in the definition of public subsidies between two subclasses - state aid and other public subsidies. The use of state aid is restricted because of its alleged harmful effects on competition and on welfare. The member states are also supervised by The European Commission. The definition of environmental protection is functional covering all voluntary or mandatory acts by individual persons or firms which prevent or reduce the harmful effects of human activities on nature or on other individuals. According to this definition many energy policy and transportation policy measures are considered as being part of environmental policy. Public subsidies or positive economic measures intended to encourage environmentally sound consumer behavior are considered as subsidies for environmental protection. The first part of the study presents the versatile theoretical foundation used in the analysis. The different strands of economic theory are combined with the different areas of law. The idea of using economic theory in the legal argumentation is here supported by a teleological theory of legal interpretation and an instrumental and functional view on law. From this point of departure the explanation of the law is the need to regulate individual action by defining desired (normative) behavior. Other modes of behavior are deterred by legal sanctions or by rules which raise the opportunity cost of normative behavior. Desired behaviour can also be induced by economic subsidies. In general individual action is seen as rational where rationality is based on individual goals and external and internal motivations. The second part analyses the legal definition of state aid, the European treaty provisions on state aid and the commission s regulation of state aid used in member states. In general, state aid or public subsidies are seen as welfare-reducing act both in legal argumentation and in economic theory unless it is targeted to internalize specific market failures. The normative theory of environmental policy does not support the idea of subsidising environmental protection measures by private firms or individuals and the environmental law has accepted this idea (polluter pays principle). However, European legislation treats state aid for environmental purposes more favourably than other aid mainly because of it s horizontal nature and the constant need to improve environmental quality. The third part focuses on the Finnish <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> and state aids. The timeframe covers the years 1990, 1995 and 2003. During that time public support for environmental protection in the form of subsidies in Finland has increased both in monetary terms and when individual support programmes or measures are counted. Measured in monetary terms, the trend seems to be rising mainly because of the energy and climate policy. The subsidy instruments that have been used have been changed toward more general measures. Moreover, many new tax subsidies have been created to promote production methods that are environmentally friendly. One reason to changed the aid patterns is no doubt the extensive and restrictive legal regulation of state aid both on the European level and on the national level. The fourth part of this study analyses the law and legal principles that rule the administrative procedures which state aid authorities must follow when giving public money to applicants. This area of law seems to involve many features intended to make individual aid decisions more efficient. At the same time those rules increase the cost of administration and widen the scope of administrative discretion. Together with a limited possibility to appeal and the limited publicity of individual decisions, these features make this area of legislation and administrative action very volnerable to criticism and to even malpractice. The theoretical analysis and the studying of Finnish <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> and law regulating them shows some legal and practical problems. Individual aid decisions are easily criticized because of the high efficiency requirement of the current law. At the same time, administrative discretion is wide {{and it seems to be}} insufficiently ruled by legislation or by the state budget. Furthermore, legal rules oblige public authors to monitor beneficiaries very closely. It is likely that this monitoring turns out to be random because of limited resources. As a result, this widens the power of public authorities. The legal analysis of subsidy programs in this study and the economic analyses that have been made on the effects of various subsidy programs by other researchers mentioned in this study indicate that the <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> in Finland are mainly used as a strategic tool in the legislative process where different interest groups must be satisfied. However, this does not enhance the efficiency of subsidy programs. State aid and subsidies could function in better coherence with the predominant command and control type of environmental policy. The informative position of the environmental administrators could be improved if the information coming from the aid applications and from the individual decisions could be used to improve the mandatory environmental rules and practices. Nevertheless, there is no indication to this effect in the Finnish <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> system. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan julkista tukea ympäristönsuojelun ohjauskeinona. Tarkastelun kohteena on julkisen tuen käytön oikeudellinen sääntely Suomessa ja tuen käyttötapa elinkeinotoiminnan ympäristöhaittojen ehkäisemisessä lukuun ottamatta maatalouselinkeinoja. Tavoitteena on luoda kuva julkisesta tuesta oikeudellisena instituutiona ja analysoida julkisen tuen sääntelyn oikeudellisia periaatteita erityisesti niiden tarkoituksenmukaisuuden kannalta. Tarkastelu perustuu tehtävänmukaiseen toimintaketjuun, joka muodostuu ongelman havaitsemisesta, tavoitteiden asettamisesta, keinojen valinnasta, tukiohjelman rakennusvaiheesta, tuen jakamisesta ja valvonnasta sekä vaikutusten arvioinnista. Tutkimuksessa keskitytään erityisesti oikeudelliseen sääntelyyn, joka kohdistuu tukiohjelman rakentamisvaiheeseen ja tuen viranomaisten toimesta tapahtuvan jakoon. Tutkimuksessa pyritään tuomaan esiin näiden kahden periaatteessa erillisen vaiheen väliset yhteydet ja sen perusteella voidaan esittää arvioita toimivan oikeudellisen sääntelyn sisällöstä.

Yhteisenä tekijänä näissä teorioissa on erityyppisten toimijoiden päätöksenteon ja päätöstilanteiden tarkastelu. Oikeustieteessä yhteiskunnallinen tutkimusote antaa mahdollisuuden arvioida oikeudellisen sääntelyn ja periaatteiden toimivuutta ja se tuo esiin oikeudellisen sääntelyn ongelmakohtia tavalla, joka ei olisi mahdollista puhtaasti lainopillisen näkökulman avulla. Oikeuden ja lain tehtävänä pidetään inhimillisen toiminnan sääntelyä osoittamalla toivotut normin mukaiset käyttäytymismallit ja asettamalla seuraamusten avulla norminvastaiselle käyttäytymiselle hinta eli vaihtoehtoiskustannus. Julkisella tuella ymmärretään tässä tutkimuksessa julkisen vallan toimia, joilla yksilöitä ja yhteisöjä kannustetaan taloudellisesti toimimaan lainsäätäjän haluamalla tavalla. Euroopan Unionin lainsäädäntö jakaa julkisen tuen oikeudellisesti artiklan 87 (1) mukaiseen valtiontukeen ja muihin tukiin. Julkisen tuen käyttö on kielletty, jos se vaikuttaa jäsenvaltioiden väliseen kauppaan. Euroopan komissio valvoo jäsenvaltioiden valtiontuen käyttöä. Ympäristösuojelulla tarkoitetaan tässä tutkimuksessa laajasti vapaaehtoisia tai säännösten edellyttämiä toimia, joilla pyritään vähentämään tai ehkäisemään inhimillisen toiminnan luonnonympäristölle aiheuttamia haittoja. Tutkimuksen toisessa luvussa tarkastellaan yleisesti valtiontuen oikeudellista määrittelyä ja eurooppaoikeudellista sääntelyä ja valvontamekanismeja sekä yleensä julkisen tuen ja ympäristönsuojelun tuen ominaisuuksia. Kolmannessa luvussa selvitetään ympäristönsuojelun tukien käyttö Suomessa vuosina 1990, 1995 ja 2003. Tarkastelu perustuu valtion talousarvioesitysten ja lainvalmisteluaineiston antamaan tietoon. Ympäristönsuojelun julkinen tuki on Suomessa vähäistä. Tarkastelujaksolla se on kuitenkin lisääntynyt merkittävästi lähinnä ilmasto- ja energiapolitiikan vuoksi. Merkittävimmät tukimuodot ovat verotukia. Harkinnanvaraisten tukien käyttöä rajoittavat oikeudelliset rajoitukset ja hallinnolliset kustannukset. Julkisen tuen käytön sääntely on toteutettu hierarkkisesti alhaisen tason säädöksin eli lähinnä valtioneuvoston asetuksilla tai sitäkin alemmanasteisin säädöksin. Lainsäädäntö ja valtion talousarvioesitys eivät juuri ohjaa tukiviranomaisten toimintaa. Tarkasteltaessa harkinnanvaraisten tukien käyttöä ohjaavia säännöksiä havaitaan, että säädökset ja oikeudelliset periaatteet eivät juuri tue ympäristönsuojelun julkisen tuen tarkoituksenmukaista käyttöä. Tukiviranomaisen harkintavallan sääntely on ristiriitaista, tukipäätösten julkisuus on puutteellista, tuenhakijoiden ja näiden kilpailijoiden oikeudellinen asema on epätyydyttävä, tukiviranomaisen velvollisuudet johtavat sisäisten resurssien epätarkoituksenmukaiseen käyttöön eikä tukien myöntäminen tue viranomaisten muiden tehtävien hoitamista...|$|E
40|$|How should green {{taxation}} be {{designed so that}} it accommodates producer interests? We argue that to design green taxes which are high enough to have the desired incentive effects, tax revenues must be reimbursed, either by earmarking them for <b>environmental</b> <b>subsidies</b> or by reducing other taxes directed at industry. If green tax schemes can be designed this way, industry will {{have little incentive to}} mobilise strong opposition to {{green taxation}}. However, in practice, the requirement of reimbursement may be difficult to fulfil because, with few exceptions, polluting industries are not homogeneous. This means that reimbursement will redistribute financial resources within industry and thus create winners and losers. Still, green taxes can be used in heterogeneous industries which can be created by operating separate tax schemes for each branch of industry. The Danish case of pesticide taxation demonstrates that relatively high tax levels can be implemented if an equal relationship between the tax object and the object determining the level of refunds exists throughout the sector. This means that revenues can be reimbursed without creating redistribution within producer communities. Green taxation; Policy design; Reimbursement; Lobbyism; Redistribution...|$|E
