30|$|However, {{for both}} 10 and 100  m/s speeds, the <b>indentation</b> force for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> starts to {{overtake}} that for wet indentation when the indentation depth reaches 3.3  nm. This phenomenon {{can be attributed}} to the change of friction force between the indenter and the work material due to the addition of water. When the indentation depth is less than a critical value, the resultant reduction of indentation force is too small to compensate the resistant force of water molecules between the indenter and the work material. When the indentation depth is beyond the critical value, the beneficial tribological effect is sufficient to compensate the resistant force. As a result, the indentation force in the late stage for wet indentation is smaller than that for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{hardness}} curve for wet indentation {{demonstrates the}} ISE, {{which means that}} the calculated hardness decreases with the increase of loading/penetration. On the other hand, the hardness-depth curve for <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> exhibits the reverse ISE, {{which means that the}} hardness increases with the increase of loading/penetration. These findings are not very common for numerical studies in the literature, but they are fairly consistent with experimental studies in the literature at larger scales.

In particular, the reverse ISE phenomenon has not been fully understood.

The objective of this research is to determine parameters from a creep test to characterise the viscoelastic properties of on-progress dried longan. During 65 C hot-air drying, the whole longan was sampled every 2 hours to perform the creep test with a constant stress of 44 kPa using a texture analyser. Viscoelastic properties, viz. retardation time (ret), instantaneous compliance (J 0), retarded compliance (J 1), creep compliance (J), Newtonian viscosity ( 0), and modulus of elasticity (E) were analysed using the four-element Burger’s model. The ret and E decreased linearly as the moisture content decreased from approximately 70 % to 64 - 57 %, then they linearly increased as the moisture content further decreased to 11 %. The J and J 1 increased linearly and then decreased linearly as the moisture content decreased, showing the transition moisture content of 64 %. The J 0 decreased as the moisture content decreased.

This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the wear behavior of carburized JIS SNCM 415 Ni-Cr-Mo steel being cryotreated and followed by carbide spray coating for achieving improvement in wear resistance.

30|$|Nano/micro-manufacturing under wet {{condition}} {{is an important}} consideration for various tool-based processes such as indentation, scratching, and machining. The existence of liquids adds complexity to the system, changes the tool/work interfacial condition, and affects material behaviors. For indentation, it may also affect material property measurements. However, little effort {{has been made to}} study this challenging issue at nano- or atomistic scale. In this study, we tackle this challenge by investigating nano-indentation processes submerged in water using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. Compared with <b>dry</b> <b>indentation</b> in which no water molecules are present, the existence of water molecules causes the increase of indentation force in initial penetration, but the decrease of indentation force in full penetration. It also reduces the sticking phenomenon between the work and tool atoms during indenter retraction, such that the indentation geometry can be better retained. Meanwhile, nano-indentation under {{wet condition}} exhibits the indentation size effect, while dry nano-indentation exhibits the reverse indentation size effect. The existence of water leads to higher computed hardness values at low indentation loads and a smaller value of Young's modulus. In addition, the friction along the tool/work interface is significantly reduced under wet indentation.|$|R

Both parental lines and their F 1 -hybrids were field-evaluated for yield and quality traits at four environments. These environments were Shambat summer 2007, Shambat winter 2007, Ed-Duiem summer 2008 and Ed-Duiem winter 2008. The magnitudes of mid-parent (MPH%), better-parent (BPH%) and standard (STH%) heterosis were estimated. Also, line × tester analysis was performed to estimate general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining abilities among parental lines as well as F 1 -hybrids. The results revealed high estimates of heterosis for forage fresh and dry yields. The predominance of additive gene effect was high for forage fresh and dry yields, whereas there was predominance of non-additive gene effect for most of the quality traits. For forage fresh and <b>dry</b> yields, the <b>testers</b> exhibited higher contribution to the GCA variance than the lines.

40|$|Multiphase flows {{are fairly}} complex {{and they are}} usually studied as a bulk. In this thesis, these flows are {{approached}} by looking at single particle interactions (particle-particle and particle-wall). This work presents experimental measurements of the approach and rebound of a particle colliding with a "deformable' surface in a viscous liquid. The complex interaction between the fluid and the solid phases is coupled through {{the dynamics of the}} flow as well as the deformation process. A simple pendulum experiment was used to produced single controlled collisions; steel particles were used to impact different aluminum alloy samples (Al- 6061, Al- 2024, and Al- 7075) using different aqueous mixtures of glycerol and water as a viscous fluid. The velocity of the particle before and after the collision was estimated by post-processing the particle position recorded with a high speed camera. For the combination of materials proposed, the elastic limit is reached at relatively low velocities. The deformations produced by the collision were analyzed using an optical profilometer. The measurements showed that the size of the indentations is independent of the fluid media. It was found that the size of the indentations was the same for collisions in air than {{for the rest of the}} collisions using various viscous fluids. The results show that the plastic deformation is only a function of the impact velocity and the material properties. The normal coefficient of restitution and deformation parameters account for losses due to lubrication effect and inelasticity, identifying then, the dominant energy loss mechanism during the collision process. According to the strain imposed in the samples due to the collision, the deformations were either elastic or elastic-plastic. The equivalent load due to the impact velocities used in this work did not reach the fully-plastic regime. For the collisions in air, different models were used to compare the experimental results showing that the elastic-plastic regime is not well characterized by only the material properties and the impact velocity. The time-resolved contact force was measured during the process of the <b>indentation</b> for the <b>dry</b> collision experiments using a quartz load transducer. The experiments clearly show four different regimes depending on the impact Stokes number: lubrication effect and elastic deformation, lubrication effect and elastic-plastic deformation, elastic deformation with no hydrodynamic effects, and elastic-plastic deformation with negligible lubrication effect.

The size of the crater formed by the impact of a single particle against a ductile target can be estimated from theory, and these estimates agree well with experimental measurements...|$|R
