40|$|Since lipid {{auto-oxidation}} during wort boiling is a determining for {{the appearance}} of staling flavour in aged beers, we have investigated the reducing power of hops added in the boiling kettle. An assay based on the inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation {{in the presence of}} an initiator [2, 2 '-azobis(2 -amidino-propane) dihydrochloride = AAPH] enabled us to distinguish hop varieties and conditionings. Large differences in hop flavanoid contents explained the higher antioxidant activity of low-cr-acid samples versus bitter varieties and CO 2 hop extracts. As expected, adding hop pellets to the kettle effectively increased the overall reducing activity of wort. Supercritical CO 2 hop extracts had no significant effect due to their extremely low level of polyphenols. The concentration of the very well-known marker of beer ageing, trans- 2 -nonenal, was lower in boiled wort exhibiting a better reducing power. The AAPH reducing power test applied to <b>hops</b> or <b>worts</b> was thus efficient to predict the nonenal synthesis during boiling. Hop varieties and conditionings emerged from this work as key-parameters for improving the reducing power of wort and the flavour stability of the final product. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Wishing to attract as many niches of consumers, brewers tend to produce every year new and innovative beers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop the technology for an innovative special beer. The synchronous alcoholic fermentation of two different origin substrates – wort and grape must - was monitored and their composition was assessed in order to obtain special beer with superior sensory properties.

Decreased lag time in beer fermentations allow for higher production and efficiency in the brewery as well as decreased risk of contamination. This study examined the use of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) as a nutrient supplement to stimulate yeast growth during fermentation. Small-scale (1 L), stirred fermentations were carried out at 15 °C using a German lager yeast in a lightly <b>hopped</b> 11 °P <b>wort</b> made from 70 % pale 2 -row malt and 30 % high glucose liquid adjunct. Two pitching rates were examined, 1 x 106 and 1 x 105 cell/ml⋅°P, and four levels of MSM (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 075 % w/w). Fermentation gravity and viable cell counts were monitored throughout fermentation until the final attenuation was achieved (approximately 5 days). The application of 0. 25 % w/w MSM resulted in the shortest lag time in both adequately (1 x 106 cell/ml⋅°P) and under-pitched (1 x 105 cell/ml⋅°P) ferments. Additionally, this treatment reached stable, maximum cell counts and final gravity the quickest.

40|$|Iso-α-acids are quantitatively {{the most}} {{important}} hop-derived fraction in beer. In addition to CO 2 and ethanol, iso-α-acids are considered the primary beer flavour components. They impart the typical bitter taste and depending on the desired beer bitterness, their concentration varies from 10 up to 100 mg/L, according to the beer type. This article is to give a review on the knowledge about the formation of iso-α-acids and the mechanisms of their degradation in the beer matrix during storage. Iso-α-acids arise from the isomerisation of <b>hop</b> α-acids during <b>wort</b> boiling. In addition to the isomerisation reaction, the beer’s bitter acids degradation has extensively been studied. Iso-α-acids are subjected to both oxidative and nonoxidative transformations. As a result, both the intensity {{and the quality of}} the beer bitterness are adversely affected. Both trans- and cis-iso-α-acids are susceptible to degradation in the presence of reactive oxygen species and light. Stored in the dark, trans-iso-α-acids in beer were found to be markedly more unstable than their cis-counterparts, and a harshy, lingering bitter taste simultaneously develops. This flavour defect occurring during beer ageing is attributed to the proton-catalysed cyclisation of trans-iso-α-acids into tri- and tetracyclic degradation products. These non-volatile degradation products of trans-iso-α-acids have only recently been identified. In contrast, only few reports deal with the formation of volatiles from iso-α-acids upon beer ageing. The relation between bitter acids degradation and aldehyde formation is cited in this review. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular and widely used {{alcoholic}} beverages is beer. There is a long-standing tradition of beer production in the Czech Republic and it is our significant export commodity. Hops, specifically the so called Saaz Late, is a typical ingredient in the production of bottom fermented a Pilsen kind of beer that has made us famous in the world. Beer is a complicated beverage and its production is not an easy process, although it may seem differently at first glance. Apart from the convenient ingredients, for the production of beer are also needed technological facilities and most importantly the knowledge. The procedure itself consists of grinding malt, mixing it with water and mashing process, which includes a shortage of polysaccharide chains by influence of malt enzymes. The extracted product is called <b>hopped</b> <b>wort</b> and it is further boiled together with hops. This process is in Czech language known as chmelovar (hereinafter referred to as wort). During the wort, there are some bitter substances coming to work (this is how mixture of ingredients and water is generally called during the whole process of production), the bitter substances are specifically alfa bitter acids and beta bitter acids. The extracted product is called <b>hopped</b> <b>wort.</b> After fermenting the <b>hopped</b> <b>wort,</b> there comes a stage of main and secondary fermentation. During this phase two crucial ingredients of beer are produced. Alcohol and carbon dioxide. Traditional for Czech regions is the bottom fermentation in which yeasts are descending to the base of a container. Biogenic amines are one of many components of the beer. However, they can be found not only in the beer, but also in almost all basic foods. We can find them in meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and even in different concentrations. Their production is often associated with the fermentation process. Regarding the content of biogenic amines in beer, due to the research it is obvious that a part of them gets into the beer from the original raw materials. Another part arises during the fermentation process. Tyramine and histamine (among others), discovered in the beer, can have a serious impact on human health. During the consumption of large quantities of such a beer, but even other foods that contain a lot of these biogenic amines, it may affect the circulatory system, breathing, cause a facial flushing and in extreme cases even cerebral haemorrhage. The intoxication by histamine is often manifested as food poisoning or allergic reactions...|$|E

40|$|Yeast {{are used}} as workhorses to convert <b>hopped</b> <b>wort</b> into beer. Conventionally, such yeasts belong to the genus Saccharomyces and most {{research}} on fermentation of wort {{for the production of}} beer has focussed on the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus. Recently, there is an increasing interest in unravelling features of non-conventional yeast species for beer innovation. In this thesis, features of yeast isolates belonging to the species: Cyberlindnera fabianii, Pichia kudriavzevii and S. cerevisiae (all isolated from fermented masau (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits in Zimbabwe), were studied with focus on aroma production. Additionally, a novel approach was used to apply these yeasts in co-cultivation with Brewers’ yeast (S. cerevisiae) for beer innovation. The characteristics and quality of the beer are mainly determined by aroma compounds in the final product such as esters, alcohols, aldehydes and acids. Yeast use various metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the fermentative pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the Ehrlich pathway to produce aroma compounds or the precursors for the synthesis thereof (Chapter 1). Among the aroma compounds, esters are of major importance, especially since they are perceived by the human olfactory system at very low concentrations. In general, esters are desirable compounds in beers due to their fruity flavour. Examples are isoamyl acetate (banana), isobutyl acetate (fruity, sweet), phenylethyl acetate (rose, apple, honey), ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl hexanoate (apple, aniseed) and ethyl octanoate (sour apple). Together with an extensive range of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) these compounds were previously profiled using headspace solid-phase-micro-extraction gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GCMS). Interestingly, comparative profiling of aromas showed that C. fabianii produces significantly higher amounts of isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate compared to S. cerevisiae.   It has been suggested in literature that products of the Ehrlich pathway, so called “fusel alcohols”, can function as signalling molecules for invasive growth upon nitrogen limitation. This suggested that nutrient limitation could affect growth performance and production of aroma compounds. Therefore, in Chapter 2, the metabolic and morphological response of S. cerevisiae, C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was analysed upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation on semi-solid (agar) media. All three yeasts showed a change in growth mode upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to unravel the cell organisation of C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii grown under nitrogen limitation. This revealed the power of cell-cell adhesion for penetrative growth and the formation of meta-filaments or pseudo-hyphae to extend the cell surface area. Such changes in growth mode may be of relevance for solid-state fermentation processes, such as fruit fermentations,  by enhanced substrate penetration of yeast. Notably, a significant  increase in the production of esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, isobutyl acetate and isopentyl acetate) by C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was found under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Understanding the relationship between nitrogen limitation and ester formation gives more insight into the ability to steer ester formation by nutrient availability in wort fermentations. The amount and type of esters are important determinants of the final flavour characteristics of the beer. Therefore, the diversity in ester production between the three yeast species was investigated by studying enzymatic reactions involved in the production (synthesis) of esters and their degradation (hydrolysis) and to link this to volatile organic compound profiles (Chapter 3). The amount and type of esters depends on substrate availability and a combination of enzyme activities supporting the synthesis and hydrolysis of the different esters formed. Esters are generally formed by a condensation reaction of an alcohol with ac(et) yl CoA by a so-called alcohol acetyltranferase (AATse). The products formed  can generally be subdivided into two groups; acetate esters and medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) esters. Alcohols are formed by reduction of aldehydes by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) using either the fermentative or Ehrlich pathway. Comparative analysis of the specific ADHs and acetate ester hydrolysing activity and subsequently linking these data with the distinct aroma profiles of the three yeasts revealed that the acetate ester hydrolysing activity is a key step in determining the final pool size of acetate esters found in the fermentation broths (Chapter 3). Under the experimental conditions, C. fabianii showed the lowest acetate ester hydrolysing activity correlating with higher extracellular levels of acetate esters indicating the suitability of this yeast for use in co-cultures with brewers’ yeast with the objective to enable the enrichment of acetate esters in the fermentation process (Chapters 4 and 5). Nowadays, there is large interest of consumers in specialty beers such as beers low in alcohol (health awareness) and/or richer is fruity flavours (specialty beers), and this has significantly stimulated the quest for new methods, practices and yeast strains to produce such beers. In chapter 4 an innovative approach is described using co-cultivations of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii to steer wort fermentation performance. Various ratios of brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii were inoculated in wort. A dose response relationship was observed, where a higher initial dose of C. fabianii leads to lower alcohol production and a more complex aroma bouquet. Interestingly, specific esters, i. e. ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl octanoate (sour apple), ethyl decanoate (waxy, sweet apple), ethyl 9 -decenoate (fruity, fatty) and ethyl dodecanoate (fruity, waxy), were found in higher levels in co-cultivation compared to both mono-cultivations indicating metabolic interactions. The reduced ethanol production in the co-culture could be explained by inhibition of Brewers’ yeast performance by C. fabianii in the co-cultivations. Further investigations revealed that this growth inhibition is caused by competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii. Depletion of oxygen caused inhibition of growth of brewers’ yeast since it needs oxygen to synthesize ergosterol that is required for cell membrane synthesis under anaerobic conditions (Chapter 4). The interaction between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation can be described using dynamic modelling (Chapter 5). A dynamic model was developed based on brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in mono-cultivation and fitted to experimental data. The two models were combined and the same parameter settings were used to predict the fermentation outcome of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation. The model was experimentally validated using inoculation ratios of 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii. Additionally, the use of dynamic modelling supported the hypothesis that competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii results in inhibition of brewers’ yeast fermentation performance. Interestingly, prediction of aroma formation in co-cultivation, especially that of specific esters, appeared to be more challenging due to metabolic interactions resulting in MCFA-esters contributing to fruity aromas, and this aspect requires further study. The results and findings obtained in the experimental chapters (Chapter 2 - 5) are further discussed in Chapter 6. Unravelling features of non-conventional yeast generates novel opportunities for beer innovation. Application of C. fabianii in co-cultivation with brewers’ yeast in wort fermentation offers a novel approach in product innovation resulting in low alcohol beers with enriched aroma bouquet. Finally, the developed dynamic model may be used to predict fermentation outcomes of brewers’ yeast with other non-conventional yeast species...|$|E
