50|$|In Pakistan and India, <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> is very {{commonly}} used to wrap a tennis ball for purposes of playing backyard cricket. The <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> provides a smooth surface, causing the tennis ball to grip a concrete surface less, makes the ball harder to hit, and causes it to bounce less. These properties make the ball behave more like a leather cricket ball, yet still being substantially cheaper and less dangerous.|$|E

40|$|GWPD 4 —Measuring {{water levels}} {{by use of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To measure the depth to the water surface below land-surface datum using the <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> method. Materials and Instruments 1. An <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> double-wired and {{graduated}} in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. Electric tapes commonly are mounted on a hand-cranked and powered supply reel that contains space for the batteries and some device (“indicator”) for signaling when the circuit is closed (fig. 1). 2. An older model <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> also known as an “M-scope, ” marked at 5 -foot intervals with clamped-on metal bands (fig. 2) {{has been replaced by}} newer, more accurate models. Technical procedures for this device are available from the procedures document archives. 3.

40|$|VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To obtain {{data from}} which an {{estimate}} of hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer can be calculated. During a slug test the water level in a well is changed rapidly, {{and the rate of}} water-level response to that change is measured. From these data, {{an estimate of}} hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using appropriate analytical methods (for example, Ferris and Knowles, 1963). A slug test requires a rapid (“instantaneous”) water-level change and measurement of the water-level response at high frequency. A rapid change in water level can be induced in many ways, including injecting or withdrawing water, increasing or decreasing air pressure in the well casing, or adding a mechanical device like a plastic rod to displace water. The water-level changes can be measured with many methods, including steel tape, <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> air line, wireline/float, an...|$|E

40|$|Seven shallow {{monitoring}} {{wells and}} eight neutron access tubes (arranged in “nests ” with tensiometers) {{were used to}} take measurements of water-table and soil-moisture changes over periods of water-table decline following high groundwater levels and flooding in the riparian zone in Sep. -Oct. 2003 and Aug. -Sept. 2004. Water-table measurements were taken every 15 minutes using pressure transducers; these data were then calibrated with <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> measurements performed periodically throughout the study. Neutron access tubes located near the wells (Figure 6) provided soil moisture profiles across the water table at each location. In 2004, the water-table fell below {{the bottom of the}} 4 original access tubes, and 4 additional deeper tubes were installed closer to the wells. The Skaggs method requires that soil moisture profiles remain in equilibrium with the water table (i. e. the vertical hydraulic gradient above the water table is zero). Graphical analysis was used to identify several soil moisture profiles consistent with this criterion; Figure 4 shows three profiles that wer...|$|E
40|$|With climate change, over-population, and {{resource}} depletion in mind, I decided to explore what photography {{might look like}} in an apocalypse-like situation. High-end DSLR cameras have become ubiquitous in photography today {{but they are not}} the only means of producing photographs. In my honors project, I examine how images can be created with even the most limited technology. To simplify photography as much as possible, I researched pinhole photography, which was first used in the mid- 1800 s. By creating a small enough aperture with a tool such as a pin, an image could be projected onto a film plane. This was the perfect technique for my research, because pinhole cameras did not require a lens, viewfinder, or a shutter more complex than a piece of black tape. I could easily construct a pinhole camera even in the most limited conditions. I found containers in various locations and fashioned them into pinhole cameras using tools I either borrowed or previously owned, staying true to my apocalyptic theme. I purchased only 15 worth of new materials to construct the cameras. Even the books I used for research were either purchased secondhand or borrowed from the library. To record the images, I used 5 x 72 ̆ 2 sheets of semi-matte low contrast Arista. Edu darkroom paper as my negatives in the larger cameras. In the small camera, I used both 100 ISO 35 mm color and monochromatic film. Through my project, I identified exactly what tools were needed, at minimum, to make a camera that could produce a photograph. I also learned how to precisely measure the pinhole and focal length for the clearest focus. Beyond this, the process was not highly rigid. Many of the components could be improvised using items already in my home: black <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> to make the camera light-tight, a magnet for an impromptu shutter, previously-used film canisters as take-up reels. Each pinhole camera had its own unique flaws, but they were relatively minor considering their makeshift quality. Shooting perfect images with the cameras, though, was nearly impossible. While virtually any container that could be made light-tight could be fashioned into a camera, they lacked the conveniences of modern cameras. Yet, each of these limitations tested my knowledge and ability as a photographer like never before...|$|E

5000|$|A move {{orchestrated by}} the Mexican {{government}} {{that in the}} end turned out to be equivocated took its toll on the Lerma as a luxury model and also on all of its competitors. Luxury automotive accessories were mostly among the percentage of imported automotive components by all of the Mexican auto industry. In an effort to reduce importation, the government banned the acquisition of luxury automotive accessories in an effort to have them produced or sourced locally. This meant an inevitable reduction in the lists of both standard and optional equipment. In the first, the Lerma lost the Quartz digital clock, the rear defroster and the [...] "Noryl" [...] wheelcovers. The extra-charge equipment list no longer offered power door locks, power windows, power seats, power trunk release and tilt steering column. Items that were standard in 1981 and survived became optional in 1982 {{in the form of the}} remote-controlled exterior mirrors. The full list of optional equipment for the 1982 VAM Lerma 620 consisted of <b>electric</b> antenna, <b>tape</b> player AM FM stereo radio, remote controlled mirrors, headers and sports steel wheels. The new aluminum wheels for 1982 were practically a replacement of the previous year's wheelcovers while the new-for-the rear wiper and washer took the place of the rear defroster.|$|R
