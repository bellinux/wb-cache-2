But so far, there is no flourishing international market for small {{wind turbines}}. Among the reasons for this are high up-front costs, <b>insufficient</b> technological <b>maturity,</b> misleading product information, the complex non-transparent market and the poor performance of many small wind systems. Nevertheless, small wind projects can be successful. Key requirements for this are a solid assessment of the wind resource, a thoughtful selection of the turbine type as well as proper siting.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study is a {{comparative}} analysis of the complex of economic, cultural and psychological resources of mothers of three groups focused on different values in child rearing (obedience “O”, curiosity “C”, sociability “S”). The study involved 500 mothers selected basing on the criterion of self-identification of their economic status (low and medium), under the age of 45, with children aged from 1. 5 to 3 years old. The analysis of the results showed that a quarter of mothers (24. 2 %) choose obedience as the dominant value of family education. Mothers from group focused on the value of “C”, account for almost half of the sample (47. 0 %). A third of the respondents are aimed at instilling sociability in children (28. 8 %). There is a certain impact that disparity in supply of mothers with various resources has on cultivating in children values contributing to a successful adaptation. Mothers instilling in children curiosity and sociability have richer cultural resources. They are also characterized by a more positive self-perception. Resulting differences are explained by both objective factors characteristic for women from the group focused on instilling obedience - a lower level of education, qualifications, financial situation, small social experience, less intensive cultural practices, and by subjective characteristics - a lower self-esteem, self-doubt, <b>insufficient</b> personal <b>maturity.</b> The experience of relationships of mothers with their own parents is further employed in the process of upbringing of children.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the top-down approach within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), a demonstrator was developed in cooperation with IBM Deutschland GmbH, IDS Scheer AG and SAP AG. A real world purchase requisition process at DaimlerChrysler AG was chosen for the demonstrator. Tools and services of different vendors {{were used for the}} project involving efforts of the vendors to improve compatibility among each other. As the purchase requisition process was implemented following the topdown approach, first a business process model was created using extended Event-driven Process Chains (eEPCs). The model was converted into WS-BPEL (Web Services Business Process Execution Language) and the resulting WS-BPEL was used for creating the IT implementation of the process. Finally, the process was ready for deployment on a process server. In addition to this, the process was modified in order to demonstrate the flexibility and agility that can be achieved with a SOA. A fast implementation of the process change was shown. The process modification was also carried out based on the top-down approach starting with a change of the business process model. However, an <b>insufficient</b> stage of <b>maturity</b> of SOA development software was recognized. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{electricity}} grid of the Netherlands is changing. There {{is a call}} of society to use more underground cables, less overhead lines (OHL) and to reduce magnetic emissions. At the same time, parts of the future transmission grid need strengthening depending on the electricity demand {{in the coming decades}} [1]. Novel high temperature superconductor (HTS) AC transmission cables can play a role in strengthening the grid. The advantages as compared to alternatives, are: economic, underground, higher power capacity, lower losses, reduced magnetic field emissions in (existing) OHL, compact: less occupation of land and less permits needed, a possibility to keep 380 kV voltage level in the grid for as long as needed. The main obstacles are: the relatively high price of HTS tapes and <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> of the HTS cable technology. In the paper we focus on a 34 km long connection in the transmission grid (to be strengthened in three of the four of TenneT scenarios [1]), present the network study results, derive the requirements for corresponding HTS transmission cable system and compare HTS system to the alternatives (OHLs and XLPE cables) ...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{pilot phase}} of the European Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) tests the PEF method and {{develops}} product category-specific rules (PEFCRs) for selected product categories. The goal of PEF is to address all relevant environmental impacts and the full life cycle of products is acknowledged. However, PEF faces several methodological and practical challenges. This paper presents key findings of a comprehensive analysis of {{the current status of}} the PEF pilot phase (mainly based on the evaluation of all draft PEFCRs). Remaining key challenges are: (1) the still open goal and policy outcome of the PEF process; (2) the difficult applicability and, thus, the unclear tangible added value of some PEF rules compared to current life cycle assessment (LCA) practice; (3) the <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> level of some predefined impact assessment methods and missing reliable methods for prioritizing impact categories; and (4) the fact that, in the worst case, the developed PEFCRs may not support a fair comparability of products. This “mid-term review” of the PEF pilot phase shows that the PEF method and the PEFCRs need to be further improved and refined for a successful policy implementation of PEF, but also for avoiding that unsolved issues of PEF affect the LCA method as such...|$|E
30|$|Livestock {{losses in}} the 2009 / 10 dzud were {{exacerbated}} by a general decline in the government’s pastoral support services since {{the transition to a}} market economy (Fernandez-Gimenez 1999; Sternberg 2010; Addison and Brown 2014). In view of this, and especially based on the herders’ analysis of the effectiveness of official versus private measures, it becomes clear that local strategies of preventive herd and pastureland management are more important than governmental interventions in the study region. Addison and Brown (2014) collected a cascading series of livestock-loss-preventing strategies that are employed by herders in the Gobi Desert, such as hay-making, selling off lean animals in autumn, deciding against mating and purchasing supplementary feed for specific animals. By modelling the economic return to these strategies for a good, normal and harsh winter, they demonstrated the relevance of markets as non-tenured institutions for coping with adverse environmental conditions. However, few markets for trading animals, livestock products and inputs such as feed exist in the aimags studied by Addison and Brown (2014) and are quasi-absent in the westernmost region of Mongolia where our study took place. Herders in this region therefore have to rely on local non-market-oriented coping strategies, most frequently portrayed as winter pen preparation and hay-making. However, a few of our respondents mentioned early sale or slaughter of skinny animals and strategic mating, similar to such knowledge of their peers in the Gobi Desert (Addison and Brown 2014) and beyond (Fratkin and Mearns 2003). The by-trend different proportions of livestock lost in different wealth strata indicate that local herders need a basic socio-economic stability, granted primarily by herd size, in order to maintain a minimum of food and livelihood security during crisis (Greatrex et al. 2015). Economic stability of livestock-keeping households relies in particular on the survival of (re-)productive animals and replacement breeding females (Tsevegmed 2016). Therefore, as the first local strategic axis, appropriate summer grazing and mating practices are laying the basis for such survival, and the practice of otor improves the body condition of selected animals that may be sold after summer to purchase feed stocks (Addison and Brown 2014). A high herd mobility that involves frequent rotation of grazing areas in summer promotes well-nourished animals and prevents overgrazing in the semi-arid and arid landscapes of Inner Asia (Sneath 1998; Tsui 2012). For the Mongolian provinces of Arkhangai and Bayankhongor, Fernandez-Gimenez et al. (2015) reported that otor and other traditional resources management practices significantly increased after the 2009 / 10 dzud in formally organized community groups as compared to individual households. In our study region, where households operate individually or at best on a khot ail basis, the practice of otor has vanished {{due to a lack of}} manpower for herding, which in summer competes with milking and milk-processing, vaccinating livestock, shearing sheep and felting wool (Tsevegmed 2016). By controlling livestock-mating, herders determine the timing of livestock parturitions (AH 04, AH 06). The best mating period for cattle and yak is in early summer and for small ruminants in autumn; in this way, all animals will give birth during the following March (TN 20), when the harsh winter months are normally over. If parturitions occur substantially later, newborn animals will reach <b>insufficient</b> physical <b>maturity</b> by the start of the next winter (AH 08). Similarly, if the herd comprises many relatively old (and weak) animals, this may also lead to increased animal losses (AH 05). These insights of the local herders concerning the relevance of strategic animal mating and selling strategies are fully supported by the results of interviews and economic modelling targeting the Gobi Desert (Addison and Brown 2014).|$|R
40|$|The Earth {{observation}} with satellite {{enables the}} monitoring of oceans, atmosphere and land. These observations are done by optical and microwave sensors. The information serves for ecological mapping, exploration of raw material, control of conventions, planning and strategic clearing-up. In this work {{an analysis of}} the ERS-SAR remote sensing market is done with special regards to the expansion of the data within the European and especially the German satellite remote sensing market. The users of the data of this microwave sensor are identified and their consumption characteristics and the development of these characteristics are analysed. With the determination of the life cycle phase of this product a basis for the development of possible marketing strategies is created. Because of the <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> of the products of this sensor regarding their operationality certain barriers appear with the diffusion of this innovation. Parts of the barriers could be reduced rapidly for example by creating systems with high repetition rate, a polypolistical market structure and simplified process chains. An analysis of the market participants, their entanglement and dependencies gives information about the actual market competition situation. By this the great dependence of the public hand and the oligopolistical market structure clear up. The multifarious existing property structures and rights of the data show the inflexibility of the market. The keys which could lead {{to the success of the}} diffusion are a polypolistical market structure and the strengthening of the diffusion agencies. (orig.) 268 refs.

40|$|Background: Working {{together}} {{efficiently and}} effectively presents a significant challenge in large-scale, complex, interdisciplinary research projects. Collaboratories are a nascent method to help meet this challenge. However, formal collaboratories in biomedical research centers are the exception {{rather than the}} rule. Objective: The main purpose of this paper is to compare and describe two collaboratories that used off-the-shelf tools and relatively modest resources to support the scientific activity of two biomedical research centers. The two centers were the Great Lakes Regional Center for AIDS Research (HIV/AIDS Center) and the New York University Oral Cancer Research for Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion Center (Oral Cancer Center). Methods: In each collaboratory, we used semistructured interviews, surveys, and contextual inquiry to assess user needs and define the technology requirements. We evaluated and selected commercial software applications by comparing their feature sets with requirements and then pilot-testing the applications. Local and remote support staff cooperated in the implementation and end user training for the collaborative tools. Collaboratory staff evaluated each implementation by analyzing utilization data, administering user surveys, and functioning as participant observers. Results: The HIV/AIDS Center primarily required real-time interaction for developing projects and attracting new participants to the center; the Oral Cancer Center, on the other hand, mainly needed tools to support distributed and asynchronous work in small research groups. The HIV/AIDS Center's collaboratory included a center-wide website that also served as the launch point for collaboratory applications, such as NetMeeting, Timbuktu Conference, PlaceWare Auditorium, and iVisit. The collaboratory of the Oral Cancer Center used Groove and Genesys Web conferencing. The HIV/AIDS Center was successful in attracting new scientists to HIV/AIDS research, and members used the collaboratory for developing and implementing new research studies. The Oral Cancer Center successfully supported highly distributed and asynchronous research, and the collaboratory facilitated real-time interaction for analyzing data and preparing publications. Conclusions: The two collaboratory implementations demonstrated the feasibility of supporting biomedical research centers using off-the-shelf commercial tools, but they also identified several barriers to successful collaboration. These barriers included computing platform incompatibilities, network infrastructure complexity, variable availability of local versus remote IT support, low computer and collaborative software literacy, and <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> of available collaborative software. Factors enabling collaboratory use included collaboration incentives through funding mechanism, a collaborative versus competitive relationship of researchers, leadership by example, and tools well matched to tasks and technical progress. Integrating electronic collaborative tools into routine scientific practice can be successful but requires further research on the technical, social, and behavioral factors influencing the adoption and use of collaboratories...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} phase of {{epidemiological}} transition, {{the most frequent}} causes of youth morbidity are disorders in reproductive health, mental disorders and injuries which are not life threatening. This, so-called new youth morbidity, is most often caused by their risky behavior, which {{in the field of}} sexuality often leads to unplanned pregnancies and abortions, as well as sexually transmitted infections. Misuse of tobacco, alcohol and narcotics, which is most commonly started in adolescence, has an unfavorable short-term and long-term influence on the psycho-physical health of the young. All research, in the world and in our country, indicate gradual yet constant growth of sexual activity of the youth and the age decrease of its starting point, especially when girls are in question. Due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> and inadequate knowledge and consciousness on the necessity of protecting reproductive health, sexual behavior of young people can often be characterized as insufficiently responsible and not supplemented with the usage of adequate protective measures. The result is frequently abortion, which terminates 90 % of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies in this age. This creates health and psychosocial risks, as well as giving birth in adolescence which is contrary to the modern health concepts that giving birth should not be performed too early, while the young are still developing. A significant increase in the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases is also present, to which the youth are especially susceptible due to the specific development period in which they are in. A serious medical and sociopathological problem of contemporary society represents the greater and greater misuse of psychoactive substances among the young people, with a tendency of decreasing the average age they are consumed for the first time, as well as the use of drugs and alcohol. With the increase of the anti-smoking campaign and restrictive measures in highly developed countries smoking among young people is decreasing, while it is increasing in Eastern Europe and developing countries. As the health disorders of young people mentioned above, are conditioned, above all, by their risky behavior and insufficient relation towards health, {{the degree to which they}} are widespread can be influenced by prevention. Educational and health institutes represent the carriers of preventive activity, which understands health education and aid to young people in overcoming life's skills, along with the necessity to direct support to the family as well, which maintains a significant place in the life of young people and has a important influence on their behavior to risk exposure. A significant influence is also legal and provision regulations, the role of mass media, as well as the activities of political, nongovernmental, religious and other organizations which determine the environment in which young people live...|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE) Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (DUF{sub 6 }) Management Program {{evaluated}} {{alternatives for}} managing its inventory of DUF{sub 6 } and issued the ''Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Alternative Strategies for the Long-Term Management and Use of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride'' (DUF{sub 6 } PEIS) in April 1999 (DOE 1999). The DUF{sub 6 } inventory {{is stored in}} cylinders at three DOE sites: Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; and East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In the Record of Decision for the DUF{sub 6 } PEIS, DOE stated its decision to promptly convert the DUF{sub 6 } inventory to a more stable chemical form. Subsequently, the U. S. Congress passed, and the President signed, the '' 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States'' (Public Law No. 107 - 206). This law stipulated in part that, within 30 days of enactment, DOE must award a contract for the design, construction, and operation of a DUF{sub 6 } conversion plant at the Department's Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, sites, and for the shipment of DUF{sub 6 } cylinders stored at ETTP to the Portsmouth site for conversion. This biological assessment (BA) has been prepared by DOE, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1974, to evaluate potential impacts to federally listed species from the construction and operation of a conversion facility at the DOE Portsmouth site. The Indiana bat is known {{to occur in the}} area of the Portsmouth site and may potentially occur on the site during spring or summer. Evaluations of the Portsmouth site indicated that most of the site was found to have poor summer habitat for the Indiana bat because of the small size, isolation, and <b>insufficient</b> <b>maturity</b> of the few woodlands on the site. Potential summer habitat for the Indiana bat was identified outside the developed area bounded by Perimeter Road, within the corridors along Little Beaver Creek, the Northwest Tributary stream, and a wooded area east of the X- 100 facility. However, no Indiana bats were collected during surveys of these areas in 1994 and 1996. Locations A, B, and C do not support suitable habitat for the Indiana bat and would be unlikely to be used by Indiana bats. Indiana bat habitat also does not occur at Proposed Areas 1 and 2. Although Locations A and C contain small wooded areas, the small size and lack of suitable maturity of these areas indicate that they would provide poor habitat for Indiana bats. Trees that may be removed during construction would not be expected to be used for summer roosting by Indiana bats. Disturbance of Indiana bats potentially roosting or foraging in the vicinity of the facility during operations would be very unlikely, and any disturbance would be expected to be negligible. On the basis of these considerations, DOE concludes that the proposed action is not likely to adversely affect the Indiana bat. No critical habitat exists for this species in the action area. Although the timber rattlesnake occurs in the vicinity of the Portsmouth site, it has not been observed on the site. In addition, habitat for the timber rattlesnake is not present on the Portsmouth site. Therefore, DOE concludes that the proposed action would not affect the timber rattlesnake...|$|E
