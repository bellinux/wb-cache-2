5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.

The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia.

50|$|Bow <b>Guiding</b> <b>is</b> {{where two}} <b>guides</b> <b>are</b> in the boat, {{one in the}} stern {{and one in the}} bow.

Bow guides use techniques such as 'spearing' through large waves, and bow draws to quickly change the direction of the boat.
