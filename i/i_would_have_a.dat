25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. But if I do call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 Fangoria interview, Billy Zane {{confirmed}} that his character, John Justice Wheeler, figured {{in the third}} season story, saying: [...] "They were thinking that Audrey and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> baby at one point, {{which could have been}} fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Grigory Margulis, {{because of}} {{restrictions}} placed on {{him by the}} Soviet government, was unable {{to travel to the}} congress in Helsinki to receive his medal. The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: [...] "I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The movie Saaz was {{supposedly}} based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha {{said about the}} movie– [...] "To have two women in long plaits, {{take a couple of}} incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time." [...] In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said– [...] "I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty. Later, didi and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good laugh!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this, Audre Lorde {{was very}} open {{to her own}} {{sexuality}} and sexual awakening. In Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, her famous [...] "biomythography" [...] (a term coined by Lorde that combines [...] "biography" [...] and [...] "mythology") she writes, [...] "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places." [...] According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection—menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother—into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.|$|E

2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I told myself that, being much less expensive, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it".|$|E
2500|$|During a 2008 {{appearance}} at Huntington, New York, Gingrich said: [...] "The more successful they've been at intercepting and stopping bad guys the less proof {{there is that}} we're in danger. The better they've done at making sure there isn't an attack {{the easier it is}} to say there {{was never going to be}} an attack anyway. It's almost as if they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us." [...] He said: [...] "I would divide the FBI into two agencies. I would have an anti-domestic crime FBI which was very cautious, very respectful of civil liberties, you are innocent until proven guilty. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. And my first advice to civil libertarians is simple. Don't plot with terrorists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1970s, Clapton {{considered}} himself a [...] "car enthusiast" [...] and often stated {{his passion for}} the Ferrari brand. Clapton currently owns or has owned a range of Ferraris, and {{when asked about his}} Ferrari collection in 1989, he said he liked the touring cars for road use the company produces and commented [...] "if I had more space and if I had been wise <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> huge collection by now and I would be a multi-multi-millionaire". In 2010, he explained that for him [...] "Ferrari has always been the number one car" [...] to own and drive, and that he always supported Ferrari on the road and in Formula One motor racing. In 2012, Ferrari honoured Clapton with the one-off special project car, the Ferrari SP12 EC. In 2014, Clapton explained that Ferrari is still his favourite car brand. Among the other vehicles Clapton owns or has owned during his life are a vintage Mini Cooper Radford which was a gift from George Harrison.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} episode of Season 19, Hammond, Clarkson and May {{took a trip}} across the US with Clarkson {{selecting}} the Lexus LFA as the car of his choice, May selecting Aston Martin Vanquish for his choice and SRT Viper for Hammond. In various events in the episode, all three participated in burn out contests {{as well as a}} drag racing event at the Las Vegas speedway where Clarkson in the Lexus LFA beat the Viper and Vanquish in head to head drag races. The episode concluded with a race across America to the Mexican border with the loser being given the task to review the first ever Mexican sports car in the following episode. Hammond in this race with the Viper had lost so he was given the task to do the review. Clarkson while summing up the Lexus LFA said [...] "it is the best car I have ever driven" [...] and claimed [...] "if someone gave me a choice of selecting one car, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blue Lexus LFA. That is how much I love this car". While describing the traits of Lexus LFA, Clarkson described [...] "The word immediate was invented for the throttle response of the Lexus LFA and for the steering, and the gearbox and just about everything else".|$|E
