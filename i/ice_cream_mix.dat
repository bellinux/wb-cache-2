40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} four dietary fibre sources (oat, wheat, apple and inulin) on the {{rheological}} and thermal properties of model sucrose-polysaccharides solutions and <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mixes</b> were investigated. The content of fibre in insoluble compounds increased significantly the viscosity and the shear thinning behaviour of the model solutions and <b>ice</b> <b>creams,</b> due to the increase of total solids {{and the formation of}} networks comprised of hydrated cellulose and hemicellulose. The increase of soluble material did not alter significantly the rheology of the samples but limited the freezing point depression and elevated the glass transition temperatures, indicating a potential cryoprotective action. The use of oat and wheat fibre favoured viscosity development due to water-binding, whereas inulin caused a remarkable increase of glass transition temperature (T-g) in model solutions and <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mixes,</b> indicating the reduction of water molecule mobility from the bulk aqueous phase to the ice crystals' surface. Apple fibre addition greatly increased viscosity and elevated the T-g values, particularly in the presence of proteins. Thus, our results suggest the potential use of dietary fibres as crystallisation and recrystallisation phenomena controllers in frozen dairy products. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> {{and other}} liquids are frozen by {{direct contact with}} carbon dioxide while carbon dioxide is {{throttled}} from a liquid phase to a saturated vapor phase. The process is demonstrated with a proof-of-principle apparatus that freezes discrete batches of mix. The fluid consumption, power consumption and space requirement of a continuous cycle implementation are modeled. In the proof-of-principle apparatus and the continuous cycle model, the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> is sprayed into the liquid carbon dioxide using 1. 0 GPH Delavan fuel nozzles; the combined fluid is throttled by 2. 0 GPH Delavan fuel nozzles, forming a fine mist during flash-freezing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{suitability}} of different homogenization pressures on appearance and quality of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> was determined. The <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> were taken from ageing tank, and depending on the source of fat in <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> (butter, vegetable fat or cream) they were homogenized under different pressures. Afterwards, by microscope with scalar, fat globule size was determined. The homogenization pressures reduce the fat globule size to 1 - 2 μm without clumping and these pressures have been characterized as adequate pressures for specific type of fat and specific portion of fat in the ice cream mixture. The higher the fat in the mixture, the lower the pressure should be. The optimal pressure for ice cream mixture containing 2 % vegetable fat was 200 bars, for 6 % 190 - 200 bars, and for 8 % 170 bars. The optimal pressure for ice cream mixture that contained 8 % butter was 190 - 200 bars, for 10 % 150, and for 12 % 135 bars.

Dynamic light scattering, steady shear, and dynamic rheological analyses were performed on mixes with different fat contents (5 and 8 %) and different aging times (4 and 20 h). The homogenization of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mixes</b> determined a change from bimodal to monomodal particle size distributions and a reduction in the mean particle diameter. Mean fat globule diameters were reduced at higher pressure, but the homogenization effect on size reduction was less marked with the highest fat content. The rheological behavior of mixes was influenced by both the dispersed and the continuous phases. Higher fat contents caused greater viscosity and dynamic moduli. The lower homogenization pressure (15 / 3 MPa) mainly affected the dispersed phase and resulted in a more pronounced viscosity reduction in the higher fat content mixes. High-pressure homogenization (97 / 3 MPa) greatly enhanced the viscoelastic properties and the apparent viscosity. Rheological results indicated that unhomogenized and 15 / 3 MPa homogenized mixes behaved as weak gels. The 97 / 3 MPa treatment led to stronger gels, perhaps as the overall result of a network rearrangement or interpenetrating network formation, and the fat globules were found to behave as interactive fillers. High-pressure homogenization determined the apparent viscosity of 5 % fat to be comparable to that of 8 % fat unhomogenized mix...|$|R

The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> emulsions prepared with and without 0. 08 % polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. <b>Ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>mix</b> was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|E
