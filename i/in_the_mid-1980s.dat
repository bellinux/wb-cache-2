50|$|A {{more recent}} study corroborates this {{findings}} and {{adds that the}} main reason the corps' engineers erred is because they misinterpreted {{the results of a}} large scale study they conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atchafalaya Basin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1980</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to limit project costs. The engineers wrongly concluded that sheet piles needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet (1 foot 1⁄4 0.3048 meters) instead of between 31 and 46 feet. That decision saved approximately US$100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability.|$|R
