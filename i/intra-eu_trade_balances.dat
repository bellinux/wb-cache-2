40|$|One of {{the main}} stylised facts that has emerged from the recent {{literature}} on global value chains is that bilateral trade imbalances in gross terms can differ substantially from those measured in value added terms. However, the factors underlying the extent and sign {{of the differences between}} the two measures have so far not been investigated. Here, we propose a novel decomposition of bilateral gross <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> that accounts for the differences between gross and value added concepts. The bilateral analysis contributes conceptually to the literature on double counting in trade by identifying the trade flow in which value added is actually recorded for the first time in international trade statistics. We apply our decomposition framework to the development of <b>intra-EU</b> 27 <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> from 1995 - 2011 and show that a growing share of <b>intra-EU</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> is due to demand in countries other than the two direct trading partners...|$|R

According to our findings, accession has provided incentives to agricultural production and to utilize natural endowments (mainly agricultural land); however, agricultural employment decrease could not be halted. Nevertheless, the economic situation of the farmers improved due to increasing incomes. Though the enlarged EU provided markets for the NMS agricultural products, the competition on their domestic markets increased significantly, resulting in massive import penetration. Consequently, most of the NMS agricultural <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> deteriorated considerably. Concerning future prospects, it highly depends on the reformulation of the Common Agricultural Policy, the new budget of the EU and the domestic economic and agricultural situation of the NMS.

40|$|The {{central issue}} in this paper is the {{creation}} of an internal market for audit services within the European Union (EU). It provides an analysis of the impact of differences between national auditing regulations on <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> in audit services. To that end, the paper distinguishes three forms of intra-Union crossborder trade in audit services: (1) cross-border establishment as an auditor; (2) cross-border provision of audit services; and (3) cross-border control of an audit firm. The paper also distinguishes four categories of regulation of auditing: (I) regulation of the qualification as an auditor; (II) regulation of competition between auditors or audit firms; (III) regulation of control of audit firms; and (IV) other regulations. For each of the three forms of intra-Union trade the paper indicates the importance of each of the four categories of regulation as trade barriers. For each of the three forms of trade the current level of <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> is then discussed. The paper shows that there is little such trade and argues that given the intra-EU auditor regulation differences, audit markets within the EU are still separate markets. This is of course remarkable against the background of the drive towards more market integration in the EU in general. The paper then uses insights from audit market research to suggest which forms of national audit market regulations in EU Member States should be removed to increase <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> in audit services. The paper identifies existing national regulations of the control of audit firms as the most important barrier. The paper argues that removing these (strict) regulations is the most promising route towards more <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> in audit services. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{computation}} {{of authority}} and hub scores provided a ranking of the sectors according to their capacity to generate a high aggregate effect on production and a wide diffusion of the effect throughout the economy. This ranking allowed us to identify the key sectors at the national and regional level, and compare this to the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trading</b> relationships. The best hubs and authorities in each economy {{are linked to the}} best hubs and authorities of the EU as a whole, and to the most <b>intra-EU</b> <b>traded</b> goods and services. This relation opens the possibility for a sectoral shock in one country to spread to other sectors in other countries and have an impact at the regional level. Authority and hubs scores maintain a close relationship with other measures of sectoral linkages. Nevertheless, the scores do not have themselves any interpretation in the sense of an output multiplier or an aggregated magnitude of the effect.|$|R

Moreover, some shares of the analysed countries in the <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade,</b> as well as relative export intensity of oilseeds and vegetable oils in these countries were estimated. On the basis of the conducted analyses it is possible to conclude that apart from Germany in trade in rapeseed and soya beans, as well as the Netherlands in trade in rapeseed and sunflower-seed, the main producers and exporters of oilseeds were competitive on the Single European Market. Excluding soya-bean oil produced in the EU mainly from imported raw material, competitive advantage of most of the countries decreased together with the level of processing and was lower in trade in vegetable oils...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary version. Comments are welcome. ______________________________________________________________________ The {{principle}} of {{free movement of}} goods is an essential dimension of European economic integration. However, European Union (EU) member countries insistently resort {{to the use of}} non-tariff measures to protect their domestic markets from competition. This paper aims to highlight the potential importance of non-tariff measures (NTMs) in <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> based upon an inventory of infringements procedures against the free movement of goods within the EU market. The data was collected from several reports by European Commission and covers 512 infringement proceedings over the period 1982 to 2004. Frequencies of NTMs are presented broken down by country and sector of activity in order to illustrate their incidence. Furthermore, we apply Pavitt sectoral taxonomy as a yardstick for describing the data. Our analysis suggests that the importance of NTMs in <b>intra-EU</b> <b>trade</b> varies considerably across countries and sectors. Moreover, it seems to indicate that NTMs have higher incidence in scale intensive and science based sectors, instead of more traditional sectors.
