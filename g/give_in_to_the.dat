5|$|The British {{government}} did not <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ultimatum, and two days later, on 11 October 1899, the Second Anglo-Boer War (South African War) broke out. When the British army marched on Pretoria in May 1900, the government was forced to flee the capital. From that moment on, Reitz {{was responsible for the}} continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal, which occurred sixty-two times until March 1902. In May of that year, Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British, {{and he was one of}} the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902.|$|E
5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburgian margraves {{had long}} sought to expand northwards, {{connecting}} land-locked Brandenburg to the Baltic Sea. The Treaty of Grimnitz (1529) guaranteed Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania upon {{the extinction of}} the local House of Pomerania, and would have come into effect {{by the death of}} Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637. By the Treaty of Stettin (1630) however, Bogislaw XIV had also effectively handed over control of the duchy to Sweden, who refused to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brandenburgian claim. The Peace of Westphalia settled for a partition of the duchy between Brandenburg and Sweden, who determined the exact border in the Treaty of Stettin (1653). Sweden retained the western part including the lower Oder (Swedish Pomerania), while Brandenburg gained the eastern part (Farther Pomerania). Frederick William was dissatisfied by this outcome, and the acquisition of the whole Duchy of Pomerania was {{to become one of the}} main goals of his foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
5|$|When Edward II {{left the}} country early in 1308 to marry the French king's {{daughter}} Isabella, he appointed Gaveston regent in his place. This was a responsibility that would normally be given to a close family member of the reigning king. There is no sign that Gaveston exploited the regency for personal gains, but the other nobles were still offended by his arrogant behaviour. This behaviour continued at the coronation feast after the King's return, during which the King largely ignored his new wife in favour of Gaveston. The collective grievances first found expression in the so-called 'Boulogne agreement' of January 1308, in which the earls of Warenne, Hereford, Lincoln and Pembroke expressed concern about oppression {{of the people and}} attacks on the honour of the crown. Though not mentioned by name, Gaveston was the implied target of this document. Later that year, in the April parliament, the so-called Declaration of 1308 demanded the renewed exile of Gaveston, again without explicitly mentioning the favourite by name. The King initially resisted, but had to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demand once {{it became clear that the}} barons had the support of King Philip IV of France, who was offended by Edward's treatment of his daughter. On 18 May, Edward consented to sending Gaveston into exile.|$|E

25|$|Combined, {{the pension}} {{and health care}} reforms the MTA sought would cost about US$30 million over the span of the three-year contract. Critics lambasted both the MTA and TWU for {{allowing}} a strike to occur over such a relatively small sum. However, the pension costs would balloon to US$160 {{million in the first}} 10 years, and US$80 million per year after 20 years. The MTA said that its reluctance to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> TWU on this point stems from fear of future deficits (projected to be 1 billion USD by 2009), although critics contend that its assertion of deficits in early 2005 was fabricated to justify fare hikes. The 2012 MTA budget maintained a $68 million deficit.|$|E

This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, knowing what the manifestation is, and not wanting to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> darkness.|$|E

25|$|On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact, which {{included}} a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was apportioned to the Soviet sphere and on 5 October 1939, signed a mutual assistance pact. On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to Latvia accusing it of not carrying out the treaty, namely of forming a military alliance against the USSR, and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia. The Latvian government decided to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ultimatum and on 17 June 1940, Soviet forces entered Latvia. The Declaration states that the Soviet ultimatum and military aggression on 17 June 1940, {{should be viewed as}} an international crime, which led to the occupation of Latvia and loss of its sovereignty and points out that the new government was formed as dictated by the Soviet Union and by international law should not be viewed as executive of Latvia as it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} match {{of the night}} the regular team of Los Villanos went {{head to head with}} the {{makeshift}} team of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther and Black Warrior who all represented Mexico's La Lagunero (the Lagoon) area, but were not considered a regular team as such. In the first fall Villano IV pinned El Galeno del Mal ("the bad Doctor"; Dr. Wagner Jr.) and then team captain Villano III pinned Blue Panther to claim the first fall for their team. In the second fall Dr. Wagner Jr. won the fall for his team by defeating team captain Villano III by pinfall. The third fall of the match, which was also the longest of the three falls by far, saw Villano IV force team captain Dr. Wagner Jr. to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pain of a submission hold. In the fourth match of the night Los Guapos ("The Hansome Ones"), the team of Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. teaming up with Tarzan Boy from Los Guerreros del Infierno. On the opposite side El SatÃ¡nico, continued his feud with Los Guerreros after they turned on SatÃ¡nico and Los Infernales, teamed up with the clear cut tecnicos of Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. In the first fall Tarzan Boy pinned his rival SatÃ¡nico while Shocker pinned Atlantis to gain the first fall. In the second fall SatÃ¡nico reversed his fortune when he pinned Tarzan Boy moments after Atlantis had pinned Shocker, tying the match at one fall apiece. In the third fall Tarzan Boy caused his team the match when he was disqualified for excessive violence against SatÃ¡nico, ignoring the referee's instructions to stop on more than one occasion. With the disqualification SatÃ¡nico, Atlantis and Mr. Niebla won the fall and the match.|$|E

Annie has spent the summer on house arrest (in {{addition}} to being on probation and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to put it away so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to <b>give</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.|$|E
