40|$|Cyclosporine A (CsA) is {{the first}} {{immunosuppressant}} universally used in allotransplantation. However, it has been demonstrated that this drug produces side effects in several organs, particularly in the kidney and in the heart. Since the immunosuppressive therapy induces myocardial toxicity, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate in the myocardium of CsA-treated rats the expression variations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2), to verify if: VEGF increased, VEGF increase was associated with MMP 2 increase and they could be considered as repair proteins. The study was carried out on 28 Wistar rats divided into two groups. The group I animals served as control and so they were subcutaneously injected daily with castor oil for 21 days; group II: animals were subcutaneously injected daily with CsA (Sandimmun, Sandoz) at the therapeutic dose (15 mg/kg) for 21 days. The group I animals (control) showed normal heart architecture and low levels of MMP 2 and VEGF. The group II animals (CsA-treated) showed structural degenerative changes with myocardial fibrosis and a clear increase both in MMP 2 and VEGF. These data show that the immunosuppressant therapy induces a high increase in both the proteins and that VEGF variations are associated with MMP 2 variations. These findings suggest that these proteins are involved in the endogenous <b>emergency</b> <b>cell</b> mechanisms induced by stress conditions, probably playing a role against myocardial injury as repair proteins...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the modern}} Demaree method, the queen {{is placed in}} the bottom box, along with one or two frames of brood (but {{containing}} no open brood), as well as one or two frames of food stores, and empty combs or foundation. A queen excluder is placed above the bottom box, thereby restricting the queen to the bottom box but allowing bees to move freely between the bottom box {{and the rest of the}} hive. The original hive, along with all open brood, is placed above the queen excluder. The method works best if the nurse bees are remove far away from the queen. The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the brood nest at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the brood nest and the queen excluder. If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create <b>emergency</b> <b>cells.</b> After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the <b>emergency</b> <b>cells,</b> and then either removes the queen excluder (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the swarming impulse is over.|$|R
40|$|The Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) {{estimation}} techniques using antenna arrays {{are applied}} in {{large areas of}} research fields and have received great attention in literature. Mobile communication, Sonar and Radar are just some examples among {{a large number of}} possible applications. For example, in military application, {{it is very important to}} recognize the direction of any threat. Another example of commercial application is to identify the direction of an <b>emergency</b> <b>cell</b> phone call so that the rescue unit can act in time to the right location. Thereby, DOA estimation using a traditional fixed antenna has many limitations and becomes inappropriate in such applications. In this letter, we describe a DOA estimation system based on an antenna array and five port circuits for detecting arrival angles in azimuth plane of signals pitched by the antenna array. For this, we have based on Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which showed a certain limit of its performance in spite of its big reputation by the researchers. In our case, we only consider uncorrelated signals and assume the channel parameters corresponding to a real context. The purpose is to compare the quality of the detected angle in term of precision depending on the number of the samples depicted. ADS software and MATLAB are used to achieve this study. The simulation results on the proposed system designed to operate at 2. 4 GHz frequency indicate that MUSIC algorithm is unable to automatically detect and localize the DOA of signals with high accuracy. Other algorithms exist and may provide more precision but require more computation time...|$|E
50|$|Queens are {{not raised}} in the typical {{horizontal}} brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce <b>emergency</b> <b>cells</b> (known as supersedure cells) made from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head-downward position and later chews {{her way out of}} the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones known as queen scent.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to explore and {{illustrate}} the potential of exposed roots to reconstruct larger-scale landslide activity and thus to complement tree-ring data gathered from stems to reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns of landslide reactivation. Work was undertaken in a forested area of the Davids-Bas landslide, Barcelonnette (Southeastern French Alps) and based on growth disturbances (GD) from 48 stems and on anatomical changes (decrease of cell lumina) in 20 exposed root sections of heavily affected Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) trees growing on the scarps and upon the landslide body. A total of 95 GD and 20 anatomical changes were identified in the samples pointing to 7 movements of the landslide body since AD 1977. The study demonstrates that reconstructions of landslide reactivations obtained from exposed roots samples are not significantly different from those gathered from stems, but that the inclusion of exposed roots permits realization of frequency maps in sectors which could not be documented with classic dendrogeomorphic approaches focusing on tree-ring records from stems (scars, cracks). In addition, and even more importantly, the inclusion of exposed roots allowed assessment of the geomorphic evolution of the landslide at the local scale and to detect precursor signals of major reactivations in the form of crack widening before the main movement was registered in the tree stems. In that sense, the combined approach presented in this paper can be considered as a valuable tool for land-use planners and <b>emergency</b> <b>cells</b> in charge of forecasting future events and in protecting people and their assets from the negative effects of landslides...|$|R

Minimising in-hospital mortality therefore demands adequate blood provision. MCE planning through live or tabletop excercies is disruptive, costly and limited in terms of experimentation. A simulation model offers potential as a practical planning tool for understanding and improving outcomes from these events. For this study we developed a discrete event simulation model of casualty blood provision at a UK major trauma centre following a generic MCE. The model incorporated the delivery of <b>emergency</b> red <b>cells</b> to different cohorts of casualties of varied priority and blood demands. Both treatment and laboratory-based blood group processing systems were modelled. The model was validated using real-life data from the experience at the main responding major trauma centre during the London bombings of 2005. Nearly half of all the transfused casualties {{on the day of the}} bombings received their transfusion requirement within one hour. Similarly, our simulation experiments incorporated this same amount within the interquartile range (IQR) of results across all 100 replications performed. Furthermore, there was no significant difference identified between the real world values and the model output for all individual red cell treatment times on paired t-test analysis (p value = 0. 35). The other principal output of interest was individual red cell group stock levels and their rate of consumption following an event, especially in terms of emergency universal donor group O red cells.

The current use of adult stem cell-derived products in hematologic intervention sets an important precedent and provides a guide for developing hESC/iPSC based therapies for the blood system. In this review, we highlight biological functions of mature cells of the blood, clinical conditions requiring the transfusion or stimulation of these cells, and the potential for hESC/iPSC-derivatives to serve as functional replacements. Many researchers have already been able to differentiate hESCs and/or iPSCs into specific mature blood cell types.
