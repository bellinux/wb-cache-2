60|$|As long as Mr. Knightley {{remained}} with them, Emma's fever continued; {{but when he}} was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued--and {{in the course of the}} sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her away, it might become an <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> to him.--How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.|$|E

6000|$|The Greek Goddess of Wisdom gave continual {{increase}} of wisdom, as the Christian Spirit of Comfort (or Comforter) continual <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort.</b> There was no question, with these, of any limit or cessation of function. But with your Agora Goddess, {{that is just}} the most important question. Getting on--but where to? Gathering together--but how much? Do you mean to gather always--never to spend? If so, I wish you joy of your goddess, for I am just as well off as you, without the trouble of worshipping her at all. But if you do not spend, somebody else will--somebody else must. And it is because of this (among many other such errors) that I have fearlessly declared your so-called science of Political Economy to be no science; because, namely, it has omitted the study of exactly the most important branch of the business--the study of spending. For spend you must, and as much as you make, ultimately. You gather corn:--will you bury England under a heap of grain; or will you, when you have gathered, finally eat? You gather gold:--will you make your house-roofs of it, or pave your streets with it? That is still one way of spending it. But if you keep it, that you may get more, I'll give you more; I'll give you all the gold you want--all you can imagine--if you can tell me what you'll do with it. You shall have thousands of gold-pieces;--thousands of thousands--millions--mountains, of gold: where will you keep them? Will you put an Olympus of silver upon a golden Pelion--make Ossa like a wart?[219] Do you think the rain and dew would then come down to you, in the streams from such mountains, more blessedly than they will down the mountains which God has made for you, of moss and whinstone? But it is not gold that you want to gather! What is it? greenbacks? No; not those neither. What is it then--is it ciphers after a capital I? Cannot you practise writing ciphers, and write as many as you want? Write ciphers for an hour every morning, in a big book, and say every evening, I am worth all those noughts more than I was yesterday. Won't that do? Well, what in the name of Plutus is it you want? Not gold, not greenbacks, not ciphers after a capital I? You will have to answer, after all, [...] "No; we want, somehow or other, money's worth." [...] Well, what is that?

40|$|This study {{addressed}} the occupant owners’ preferences in deciding about innovative renovation concepts. Respondents {{were asked to}} choose between two rendered images representing a terrace house built from 1946 to 1976. Every image consisted of six characteristics or attributes, namely insulation of the outer wall, technical measures, simple payback time, inconvenience during the work, the attitude and behavior of the owner, and the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort.</b> The results showed that occupant-owners do prefer renovation concepts that do not change the façade (Light insulation). Respondents did not appreciate the idea of zoning. They preferred technical measures like solar boiler or heat pump. Higher levels of comfort, i. e. more functional floor space, might significantly contribute to higher acceptance of ambitious renovation concepts. This might be one way to compensate for disadvantages such as investments and inconvenience during the works. Simple payback time seems to become unacceptable when it exceeds the threshold of about 14 years. Regarding inconvenience, respondents clearly preferred {{to stay at home}} during the works. Finally, this study clearly shows that respondents in some way are willing to make behavioral choices by preferring white-line household appliances with A++ labels.

40|$|In recent years, {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of Home Automation Systems followed the spread of Internet of Things and its intent to make every home smart for end-users through Internet and Wireless connectivity. Ambient intelligence is an emerging discipline as well that aims to bring intelligence to environments making them sensitive to people {{through the use of}} embedded smart objects. Together, Automation Systems, Internet of Things and Ambient Intelligence make great interaction between people and the environments they live in possible. The enhancing of these interactions was one the main goals of this thesis whose intent was to improve the classic concept of Home Automation System through Internet Of Things philosophy. The first research objective was {{the design and}} implementation of a basic Internet of Things architecture {{that can be used for}} several Home Automation and Monitoring applications such as lighting, heating, conditioning or energy management. In particular, besides controlling features, the system can optimize energy consumptions by increasing awareness of users that have full control of their house and the possibility to save money and reduce the impact of energetic consumption on the earth, matching the new “green” motto requirements. According to IoT, innovative plug-and-play and ready-to-use smart devices were designed and implemented as part of this reactive automation system that offers a user-friendly web application and allows users to control and interact with different plans of their house in order to make life more comfortable and be aware of their energy consumptions. Control and awareness were two important key points for the first stage of research activity. The next challenge was to enhance IoT with intelligence and awareness by exploring various interactions between human beings and the environment they live in. The system was progressively enhanced evolving from a reactive system to a proactive system where the knowledge of human needs, in addition to the current environment status, constitute a new input for the system whose further objective is to find the right automations that can satisfy human needs in real-time. This advanced proactive system can sense and infer the user’s and the environment’s context and consequently decide autonomously how to affect the environment and actuate smart actions. It was experienced by many researchers that, for several reasons, some users might not appreciate these kinds of proactive actuations so, another challenge was the design of a system which is able to learn from user’s context and feedbacks history and, subsequently, to adapt itself to always up-do-date users’ expectations and keep the rules for triggering smart actuations constantly updated. The system was at a later time transformed into a “Inferactive” system. Another important scope of the research was the in-depth examination of the motivations for energy-efficient communications in wireless systems by highlighting emerging trends and identifying the challenges that need to be addressed to enable novel, scalable and energy-efficient wireless communications. One of the most important issues for researchers that must be addressed in designing communication protocols for wireless networks is how to save devices’ energy while meeting the needs of applications. For this reason, the architecture proposed was also enhanced at a communication level with energy-awareness in order to minimize energy consumption by communication devices, protocols, networks, end-user systems and data centers. To do this, some smart devices have been designed with multiple communication interfaces, such as RF and Wi-Fi, by using open-source technology such as Arduino. They have been analyzed under different working conditions and network topology. Communication parameters, data size and device status have been changed dynamically according to different scenarios and specific quality of service required, such as the speed of response, in order to find the best hardware and software configuration that offers the most benefits in terms of energy cost/quality ratio, lowest energy consumption and extended lifetime for battery-powered devices. The last challenge was to improve energy consumption of battery-powered smart devices provided with Wi-Fi that is commonly considered a very energy-expensive communication interface if compared to Bluetooth or ZigBee. Research focused on social IoT solutions for Home Automation Systems where devices are socially connected to Internet and can communicate through social applications like Facebook, Twitter or Google+ with a community of users that usually interact with that device itself. A fuzzy-based solution was proposed to classify the social community interaction with the system in order to implement an adaptive energy saving mode for social Wi-Fi devices according to users’ current context, behavior, habits and feedbacks. Test and performance evaluation regarding energy consumption and efficiency in real world scenario with real hardware devices were performed to prove the efficiency of the solution in terms of electricity consumption, battery lifetime, CPU utilization and <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>comfort</b> and satisfaction levels for community users. The thesis is organized as follows. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 contains the basics for a better understanding of the solutions proposed such as Internet of Things, Ambient Intelligence, Smart Homes and Smart Devices energy level issues. Chapter 4 describes the solution proposed, in particular, the system architecture and how the system evolved from reactive, to proactive and finally to “inferactive”. Chapter 5 examines how to deal with energy-aware communication and how Wi-Fi communication was improved in terms of energy consumption through social IoT awareness and fuzzy logic. In closing, Chapter 6 presents the test and the results achieved. Scuola di Dottorato "Archimede" in Scienze, Comunicazione e Tecnologie, Ciclo XXVIII a. a. 2017 Università della Calabri...|$|E
