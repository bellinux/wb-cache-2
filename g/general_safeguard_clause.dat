40|$|When imports surge, governments often face a {{conflict}} among political objectives. They seek simultaneously to satisfy protectionist pressures through increased tariffs, induce adjustment to foreign competition, and minimize consumer costs of protection. The WTO’s <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> {{can be viewed}} as a way to resolve this political objectives conflict since it allows governments to offer an implicit contract to protected industries in order to induce them to adjust. In this paper, we show that with asymmetric information about costs, protected industries behave strategically which leads to underadjustment. The <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> therefore cannot optimally resolve the conflict among domestic political objectives...|$|R
50|$|Member States may invoke a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> to {{temporarily}} restrict or prohibit use and/or {{sale of a}} GMO crop within their territory if they have justifiable reasons to consider that an approved GMO crop may be a risk to human health or the environment. The EC is obliged to investigate and either overturn the original registrations or ask the country to withdraw its temporary restriction.

500|$|The declaration's first <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> {{referred}} to protecting the civil and religious rights of non-Jews in Palestine.

30|$|Another {{striking}} {{finding of}} the WDN survey {{is that of}} those who indicated inflation indexation of base wages a vast majority replied that wages were indexed to past inflation. The pattern was similar across all size groups and sectors. Once again, this response may {{have been influenced by}} the specific way that the indexation mechanism operated in Slovenia. As noted in Section 2, Slovenia moved away from backward indexation to forward-looking indexation in 2002, and agreements further included a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> for additional increase if actual inflation exceeded the projected or specified rate. The 2006 agreement did not explicitly include an indexation coefficient and figure for projected inflation but had a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause.</b> This may have influenced respondents to interpret the framework as backward- looking indexation. It is difficult to decipher why indexation was considered informal by a sizeable percentage of the sample, because indexation was a key feature of collective agreements and there was a formal rule.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{it is argued}} that (1) the Accession Treaties have been used in {{accordance}} with their nature and proclaimed objective: they only brought about limited changes to primary law, proper to the needs of accession and have not introduced any fundamental changes. The numerous and still growing arrangements that depart from the principle of the application of the acquis in toto on accession do not alter this conclusion. (2) The evolution, especially from the 2004 Accession Treaty onwards and predictable for the future Accession Treaties (e. g. with Turkey), shows a tendency of diversification of that legal instrument by (a) adding new and/or reinforced elements of conditionality, protracted from the pre-accession phase to the membership phase, devising new mechanisms of conditionality and control (<b>general</b> and specific <b>safeguard</b> <b>clauses,</b> monitoring and verification mechanisms, membership postponement clause) and thus (b) contributing to a further differentiation in two respects - as among the Member States and with regard to the core acquis. Such differentiation exists already {{on the basis of the}} constitutive treaties (“in-built constitutive treaties induced differentiation”) and is accentuated by the Accession Treaties and their transitional arrangements (“Accession Treaties induced differentiation”). Questions of differentiation acquired another dimension with the introduction of the citizenship of the EU. (3) Finally, negotiations with certain candidate countries will show whether additional innovations are to be expected: a) whether future instruments of accession would be used in order to increase the existing level of differentiation (and protract the pre-accession phase logic well into the membership phase) with the conditionality becoming the most important element of the relations within an enlarged EU and thus paradoxically negating the nature of the integration itself, b) whether they will perhaps be used to bring about more important modifications to the treaties, or c) whether they will go as far as to provide a legal basis for permanent derogations with regard to certain new Member States (as explicitly envisaged, for instance, in the negotiating framework for Turkey) ...|$|R
50|$|Co-existence is {{regulated}} {{by the use of}} buffer zones and isolation distances between the GM and non-GM crops. The guidelines are not binding and each Member State can implement its own regulations, which has resulted in buffer zones ranging from 15 metres (Sweden) to 800 metres (Luxembourg). Member States may also designate GM-free zones, effectively allowing them to ban cultivation of GM crops in their territory without invoking a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|R

5|$|The second <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> was a {{commitment}} that nothing should be done which might prejudice {{the rights of the}} Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.|$|R

30|$|While {{the survey}} {{responses}} reflect respondent bias, one can conjecture a few {{reasons for the}} seeming inconsistency. First, {{it is possible that}} the base wages negotiated in the sectoral agreements went up by more than the indexation amount suggested in the general agreement. Second, {{it is possible that the}} respondents did not pay attention to the fact that the question referred to base wages rather than total gross wages. Since nominal total gross wages grew more rapidly than inflation because of reasons related to productivity growth and other performance considerations, it is possible that the respondents did not perceive inflation indexation as being relevant or binding for overall wage determination. Third, the respondents may have misinterpreted the guidelines for indexation in the general collective agreement. The <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> for additional wage increases in 2006 was not triggered because actual inflation in end-December was less than projected 16. Also, the general agreement for 2006 – 07 specified a particular rate of wage increase without any explicit reference to indexation 17, and the <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> related to inflation developments in 2006 was to take effect in 2007. Thus, these two aspects could have mistakenly led some respondents to believe that indexation of wages to inflation did not apply in 2006. Fourth, it may be that the respondents were influenced by the fact that, unlike in earlier years, the indexation mechanism in 2006 was not government imposed.|$|R

The EFSA GMO Panel assessed whether the submitted documentation comprised new scientific information that would change or invalidate the conclusions of its previous risk assessments on oilseed rape GT 73. The EFSA GMO Panel also considered the relevance of the concerns raised by Austria {{in the light of the}} most recent data published in the scientific literature. The authorised uses of oilseed rape GT 73 exclude cultivation, but data on gene flow, persistence and invasiveness derived from cultivation were considered as a worst case, representing conditions where exposure and potential impact are expected to be the highest, to assess possible environmental impacts resulting from seed import spills. In the documentation provided by Austria and in the scientific literature, the EFSA GMO Panel could not identify new scientific evidence that indicates that the import and processing of oilseed rape GT 73 for feed uses in the EU pose a significant and imminent risk to the environment. In conclusion, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that, based on the documentation supplied by Austria and a review of recent scientific literature, there is no specific scientific evidence in terms of risk to the environment that would support the notification of a <b>safeguard</b> <b>clause</b> measure under Article 23 of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC nor its prolongation, and that would invalidate its previous risk assessments of oilseed rape GT 73...|$|R
