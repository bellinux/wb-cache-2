Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Norse-American community that had been perceived as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E

In his book Absent Fathers, Lost Sons Canadian Jungian analyst Guy Corneau writes {{that the presence of}} the father's body during the son's developmental phases is integral in the son developing a positive sense of self as masculine. Corneau also argues that if the son does not develop positively towards the father's male body, then the son runs the risk of developing negatively towards all bodies. Jacques Lacan argued that in the son's mind, the father's body represents the law, and that the role of the father's body is to break the attachment the son feels to the mother and by extension his own.|$|E

After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E
500|$|In 1833 the British Association for the Advancement of Science {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} magnetic measurements across the United Kingdom. Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, a multi-year measuring project began, with the results {{to be published in}} 1838. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt wrote to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, stating that a formal program was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nation with dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that [...] "the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than {{one of the most important}} branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit" [...] and mapping its variations would be [...] "regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking".|$|E

500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to fumigate buildings.|$|E
500|$|According to Mathijs, {{critical}} reception is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy. [...] Topicality, {{which can}} be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response. [...] Cultural topics make the film relevant {{and can lead to}} controversy, such as a moral panic, which provides opposition. [...] Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film. [...] These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar. [...] However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important. [...] While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist. [...] Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status. [...] Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's comments about Korean culture in his review of Oldboy (2003). [...] Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and Roger Ebert dueled over I Spit On Your Grave (1978). [...] Briggs would later contribute a commentary track to the DVD release in which he describes it as a feminist film. [...] Films which do not attract enough controversy may be ridiculed and rejected when suggested as cult films.|$|E
500|$|Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", {{was given}} during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. It {{primarily}} addresses {{an audience of}} African-American women. [...] Pauli Murray acknowledges the fact that African-American women always {{have contributed to the}} progress of the Civil Rights Movement. She asserted that African-American women have worked just as hard as, if not harder than, African-American men to achieve equal rights among black people and white people. According to Murray, [...] "Not only have they stood...with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it." [...] The black women decided to [...] "...continue......" [...] for their freedom and liberty even when [...] "...their men..." [...] began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might. They were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts. Their work ethic and persistence defined African-American women as <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> long fight against racism in America.|$|E

500|$|Director Greg Beeman found {{shooting}} the episode difficult {{because he had}} recently lost his father; he noted, [...] "I left from his funeral to go to Vancouver to direct the episode, so the emotions were very poignant for me." [...] Souders stated that the production staff wanted the climactic scene of Lana's death to be a [...] "big event". Originally, the show's producers wanted the car accident {{to be caused by}} a train. However, the show was not able to afford the special effects to pull the scene off, and so, the sequence was re-written to feature a bus crash. Souders noted that if the show had been unable to afford the bus wreck, it would have been re-written into a [...] "little car wreck". The Lana's entire sequence death was choreographed by Christopher Sayour—series stunt coordinator and Welling's stunt double. Sayour described the scene as [...] "important to me and <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lot of people". The car crash sequence itself was actually a collage of several different shots. First, Kreuk was filmed driving a car on a process trailer with a mounted camera. A separate shot was filmed with a stunt double driving a lead car that was attached to a dummy car driving down a road at high speed. A bus was then driven in a perpendicular direction. The dummy car was attached with a detonator so that when the bus hit it, it would detach and not pull the lead car with it, and the timing for the crash was practiced several times during rehearsals. Finally, after the car was smashed by the bus, Kreuk was positioned on the ground to give the effect that she was actually in the car wreck.|$|E
