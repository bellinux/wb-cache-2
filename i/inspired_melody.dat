50|$|The sum of Anfossi's {{work is not}} {{completely}} known, but he composed at least 60, possibly 70 or more, operas, and at least 20 oratorios in Latin and Italian. His early work is, understandably, closely related in style to that of his teachers, Piccinni and Sacchini, with diatonic harmony and intermittently <b>inspired</b> <b>melody.</b> His orchestration style changed significantly {{during the course of}} his career; he realised more colourful effects through the use of wind instruments. Until the middle of the 1770s his opera buffa showed him to prefer the old-fashioned, pure da capo type of aria, in order to, as in his comic works, proceed to more freely shaped passages. He appeared to prefer longer passages such as finali, and he clearly had a preference for sentimental moments and phrases.|$|E

50|$|While {{these works}} find few {{similarities}} with the operatic {{style of the}} early 19th century, {{it is likely that}} some folk influence, especially from Bellini's native Sicily, may have <b>inspired</b> their <b>melodies.</b> The poetry is in most cases anonymous and usually incorporates a folk meter. In response to their romantic theme and florid imagery, Bellini provides restrained and enchanting melodies.|$|R

They returned for the 1996 festival but by that time Seanheist had left the group due to his waining interest in playing extreme metal. Aaren “Suds” Suttil (1974–2006) of Dreadnaught replaced him on drums.|$|R

2500|$|Thomas Moore (1779-1852) was an Irish-born English poet, songwriter, satirist, {{and writer}} of {{miscellaneous}} prose.
