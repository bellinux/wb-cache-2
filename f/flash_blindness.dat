25|$|Also, {{the weaker}} effects {{are part of}} any {{stronger}} effect. Even if a laser does not cause eye damage at 25 feet, it can still cause <b>flash</b> <b>blindness,</b> glare and a distraction.|$|E
25|$|Temporary <b>flash</b> <b>blindness.</b> This works {{exactly like}} a bright camera flash: there is no injury, but night vision is {{temporarily}} knocked out. There may be afterimages—again, {{exactly like a}} bright camera flash leaving temporary spots.|$|E
25|$|Day vs. night. Almost all {{concern is}} over {{nighttime}} illumination. The three visual effects listed above (distraction, glare and <b>flash</b> <b>blindness)</b> are minimized {{during the day}} since the eye is not dark adapted, and since visible lasers are not often used outdoors in daytime.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{he would}} gather strength. He {{stretched}} out on the ice full length, face downward, and for half an hour he lay and rested. Then he arose, shook the <b>flashing</b> <b>blindness</b> from his eyes, and took hold of the boat. He knew his condition accurately. If the first effort failed, the following efforts were doomed to fail. He must pull all his rallied strength into the one effort, and so thoroughly must he put all of it in that there would be none left for other attempts.|$|R
25|$|For {{any given}} laser, the {{relative}} distances shown here may change. For example, an invisible (infrared) laser {{can be an}} eye hazard for hundreds of feet, but presents no <b>flash</b> <b>blindness,</b> glare or distraction hazard. Because of this, each laser must be analyzed individually.|$|E
25|$|The graphic (right) shows many {{important}} laser/aviation safety concepts. For example, {{it shows that}} the areas of most concern—eye damage, <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> and glare—occur relatively close to the aircraft. The distraction risk covers the longest hazard distance, but fortunately also presents the least concern. The photos in the graphic also give an idea of what the visual effect looks like to the pilot, at various distances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>blindness</b> {{is caused}} by the initial {{brilliant}} flash of light produced by the nuclear detonation. More light energy is received on the retina than can be tolerated, but less than is required for irreversible injury. The retina is particularly susceptible to visible and short wavelength infrared light, since this part of the electromagnetic spectrum is focused by the lens on the retina. The result is bleaching of the visual pigments and temporary blindness for up to 40 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Under certain conditions, {{laser light}} or other bright lights (spotlights, searchlights) {{directed}} at aircraft {{can be a}} hazard. The most likely scenario is when a bright visible laser light causes distraction or temporary <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> to a pilot, during a critical phase of flight such as landing or takeoff. It is far less likely, though still possible, that a visible or invisible beam could cause permanent harm to a pilot's eyes. Although laser weapons are under development by the military, these are so specialized, expensive and controlled that it is improbable for non-military lasers to cause structural damage to an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Since November 19, 2004, {{there have}} been over 2,800 {{incidents}} of lasers directed at aircraft within the United States. These concerns have led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as <b>flash</b> <b>blindness.</b> If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light. Some observers believe that the danger is greatly exaggerated, at least for small hand-held lasers.|$|E
2500|$|With safety trials {{complete}} {{in the late}} 2000s, laser dazzlers {{have been developed for}} defensive purposes on super-yachts. They can be effective up to [...] with the effects going from mild disorientation to <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> at closer range.|$|E
2500|$|The {{optional}} Sensitive Flight Zone is {{designated by}} the FAA, military or other aviation authorities where light intensity must be less than 100 μW/cm². This might be done for example around a busy flight path or where military operations are taking place. This [...] "was identified {{as the level of}} exposure at which significant <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> and afterimages could interfere with a pilot's visual performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|To give another example, {{here are}} {{calculations}} {{of a more}} powerful laser—the type that might be used in an outdoor laser show. A 6-watt green (532nm) laser with a 1.1 milliradian beam divergence is an eye hazard to about , can cause <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> to about 8,200 feet (1.5 mi/2.5km), causes veiling glare to about 36,800 feet (...) , and is a distraction to about 368,000 feet (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the {{question}} of physical injury to the eye from a laser pointer, several other undesirable effects are possible. [...] These include short-lived <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> if the beam is encountered in darkened surroundings, as when driving at night. [...] This may result in momentary loss of vehicular control. [...] Lasers pointed at aircraft are a hazard to aviation. A police officer seeing a red dot on his chest may conclude that a sniper is targeting him and take aggressive action. In addition, the startle reflex exhibited by some exposed unexpectedly to laser light of this sort {{has been reported to}} have resulted in cases of self-injury or loss of control. [...] For these and similar reasons, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised that laser pointers are not toys and should not be used by minors except under the direct supervision of an adult.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advice to}} cover one's exposed skin with {{anything}} that can cast a shadow, like the picnic blanket and newspaper used by {{the family in the}} film, may seem absurd at first when one considers the capabilities of a nuclear weapon, but even the thinnest of barriers such as cloth or plant leaves would reduce the severity of burns on the skin from the thermal radiation( [...] the thermal radiation/flash is light, similar in average emission spectrum/color to sun light, emitting in the ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared range but with a higher light intensity than sunlight, with this combination of light rays capable of delivering radiant burning energy to exposed skin areas. While the duration of emittance of this burning thermal radiation, which can be experienced by people within range, increases with yield, it is usually at least a few seconds long.) Furthermore, great importance is given to closing eyelids and covering the location of the eyes as temporary and permanent <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> is a risk potential without this covering, especially at night. A photograph taken about 1.3km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that the shadowing effect of leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden utilities pole from charring discoloration due to the burst of thermal radiation, however the rest of the telephone pole, not under the protection of the leaves, was charred almost completely black.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>blindness</b> {{is caused}} by {{bleaching}} (oversaturation) of the retinal pigment. As the pigment returns to normal, so too does sight. In daylight the eye's pupil constricts, thus {{reducing the amount of}} light entering after a flash. At night, the dark-adapted pupil is wide open so <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> has a greater effect and lasts longer.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether pain is {{directly}} associated with <b>flash</b> <b>blindness.</b> Reaction to <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> can be discomforting and disorienting. The retina has no pain receptors. Nonetheless, psychological pain, which activates the same pain centers {{in the brain and}} therefore is just as real, may very well be present. It can cause amplified stress levels but usually fades.|$|E
50|$|Welders can get {{a painful}} {{condition}} called arc eye. While it is caused by bright light as is <b>flash</b> <b>blindness,</b> the welder's arc lasts for much longer than a flash, and emits ultraviolet rays that can damage the cornea. <b>Flash</b> <b>blindness,</b> in contrast, {{is caused by a}} single very brief exposure which oversaturates the retina, and is not usually accompanied by reports of pain.|$|E
50|$|Because {{vision loss}} is sudden and {{takes time to}} recover, <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> can be hazardous. At some {{sporting}} events such as figure skating, fans are cautioned to not use flash photography {{so as to avoid}} distracting or disorienting the athletes. Also in aviation, there is concern about laser pointers and bright searchlights causing temporary <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> and other vision-distracting effects in pilots who are in critical phases of flight such as approach and landing.|$|E
50|$|A dazzler is a {{non-lethal}} weapon which uses intense directed radiation to temporarily disable its target with <b>flash</b> <b>blindness.</b> Targets can include sensors or human vision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>blindness</b> is visual {{impairment}} during and following {{exposure to a}} light flash of extremely high intensity. It may last {{for a few seconds}} to a few minutes.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the weaker}} effects {{are part of}} any {{stronger}} effect. Even if a laser does not cause eye damage at 25 feet, it can still cause <b>flash</b> <b>blindness,</b> glare and a distraction.|$|E

50|$|As {{with its}} {{infrared}} and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary <b>flash</b> <b>blindness.</b> Some sources state {{that there is}} no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have found}} that even {{low-power}} laser beams of not more than 5 mW can cause permanent retinal damage if gazed at for several seconds; however, the eye's blink reflex makes this highly unlikely. Such laser pointers have reportedly caused afterimages, <b>flash</b> <b>blindness</b> and glare, but not permanent damage, and are generally safe when used as intended.|$|E
5000|$|The bright initial {{flash of}} a nuclear weapon is the first {{indication}} {{of a nuclear}} explosion, traveling faster than the blast wave or sound wave.
