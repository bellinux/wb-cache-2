5000|$|In 1991 the FDA {{approved}} {{the first version}} of Genzyme's orphan drug Alglucerase (brand name Ceredase), the only treatment for Gaucher's disease. At that time, according to Genzyme CEO Henri Termeer — a pioneer in the biotechnology industry business model — one treatment of Ceredase for one patient took 22,000 placentas annually to manufacture, a difficult and expensive procedure. [...] A new version of Ceredase, called Cerezyme, <b>Imiglucerase</b> which Genzyme produced in 1994 using genetically modified cells in vitro, was cheaper and easier to produce, was approved in several countries. In 2005 there were only about 4,500 patients on Cerezyme. In marketing <b>imiglucerase,</b> Termeer introduced the innovative and successful business strategy that became a model for the biotechnology or life sciences industry in general and specialty pharmacy in particular. Genzyme's added revenue from profits on the highly priced orphan or specialty drugs like <b>imiglucerase,</b> which had no competition, was used to undertake research and development for other drugs and to allow them to fund programs that distribute a small portion of production for free. In 2005 he then created what would eventually become a feature service of specialty pharmacy, by hiring 34 people to help patients acquire insurance plans that would cover the cost of their drugs. By 2005 although Cerezyme cost the average patient (including babies) $200,000 a year, it could cost a single adult patient as much as $520,000 a year even though it cost Genzyme less than $52,000 to manufacture, because the alternative is severe debilitation and early death.

Although <b>imiglucerase</b> costs only less than 37 cents to manufacture, Genzyme charges $3.70 per unit making a 90% profit. The high price of the medication is part of Genzyme's business strategy in order for the biotech firm to undertake research and development for other drugs and to allow them to fund programs that distribute a small portion of production for free. So instead of lowering the price Termeer [...] "decided to use the extra revenue to give additional Cerezyme away free in countries that can't afford to pay the high price. He said Genzyme gives away about 10% of the drug it produces." [...] In order to ensure patients had access to Cerezyme, by 2005 Genzyme had hired 34 people to help patients acquire insurance plans that would cover the cost of their drugs. By 2005 there was still no competition for the drug and with patients desperate for a therapy, most insurers were willing to pay.

40|$|Gaucher disease, {{the most}} common {{lysosomal}} storage disease, can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in which defective acid-β-glucosidase (GlcCerase) is supplemented by a recombinant, active enzyme. The X-ray structures of recombinant GlcCerase produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (<b>imiglucerase,</b> Cerezyme®) and in transgenic carrot cells (prGCD) have been previously solved. We now describe the structure and characteristics of a novel form of GlcCerase under investigation {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease, Gene-ActivatedTM human GlcCerase (velaglucerase alfa). In contrast to <b>imiglucerase</b> and prGCD, velaglucerase alfa contains the native human enzyme sequence. All three GlcCerases consist of three domains, with the active site located in domain III. The distances between the carboxylic oxygens of the catalytic residues, E 340 and E 235, are consistent with distances proposed for acid–base hydrolysis. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase,</b> as well as their specific activities, are similar. However, analysis of glycosylation patterns shows that velaglucerase alfa displays distinctly different structures from <b>imiglucerase</b> and prGCD. The predominant glycan on velaglucerase alfa is a high-mannose type, with nine mannose units, while <b>imiglucerase</b> contains a chitobiose tri-mannosyl core glycan with fucosylation. These differences in glycosylation affect cellular internalization; the rate of velaglucerase alfa internalization into human macrophages is at least 2 -fold greater than that of <b>imiglucerase...</b>|$|E

40|$|Gaucher {{disease is}} caused by {{mutations}} in the enzyme acid β-glucosidase (GCase), {{the most common of}} which is the substitution of serine for asparagine at residue 370 (N 370 S). To characterize the nature of this mutation, we expressed human N 370 S GCase in insect cells and compared the x-ray structure and biochemical properties of the purified protein with that of the recombinant human GCase (<b>imiglucerase,</b> Cerezyme®). The x-ray structure of N 370 S mutant acid β-glucosidase at acidic and neutral pH values indicates that the overall folding of the N 370 S mutant is identical to that of recombinant GCase. Subtle differences were observed in the conformation of a flexible loop at the active site and in the hydrogen bonding ability of aromatic residues on this loop with residue 370 and the catalytic residues Glu- 235 and Glu- 340. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed a pH-dependent change in the environment of tryptophan residues in <b>imiglucerase</b> that is absent in N 370 S GCase. The mutant protein was catalytically deficient with reduced Vmax and increased Km values for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and reduced sensitivity to competitive inhibitors. N 370 S GCase was more stable to thermal denaturation and had an increased lysosomal half-life compared with <b>imiglucerase</b> following uptake into macrophages. The competitive inhibitor N-(n-nonyl) deoxynojirimycin increased lysosomal levels of both N 370 S and <b>imiglucerase</b> 2 – 3 -fold by reducing lysosomal degradation.

40|$|The {{development}} of recombinantly manufactured enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionised {{the management of}} some inherited disorders of metabolism. Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which ERT became commercially available and ERT remains first-line treatment for affected individuals. In Australia, 70 patients with Gaucher disease are treated through a centrally administered Australian Government national program known as the Life Savings Drug Program (LSDP). <b>Imiglucerase</b> (Cerezyme), manufactured by Genzyme Corporation, is the only ERT currently registered in Australia {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease. In June 2009, Genzyme Corporation announced the detection of a virus in its Allston Landing manufacturing facility which resulted in inventories of <b>imiglucerase</b> being insufficient to meet projected global demand. The Australian Government sought advice from its Gaucher Disease Advisory Committee (GDAC) on recalculating patient doses in order to ration available <b>imiglucerase</b> to those most in need on a clinical severity basis. Management of this rationing process was urgent and required extensive investigation to develop a clinical severity hierarchy, to review available <b>imiglucerase</b> stock spread across multiple pharmacies, to implement a strategy for redistributing available <b>imiglucerase</b> according to specific patients' recalculated doses, to advise treating doctors and patients concerning these changed circumstances and to consider new monitoring schedules during the drug shortage phase. A cohort of 24 patients was withdrawn from therapy, 22 of whom had no discernable clinical adverse effect. This experience suggests that short-term studies of maintenance therapy without a no-treatment arm may lead to erroneous conclusions and that some patients may have treatment holidays or delayed infusions without short-term adverse outcomes.

Within 3 to 5 years of <b>imiglucerase</b> therapy, best documented at doses of 30 to 60 units/kg/infusion, hepatosplenomegaly can be expected to be reduced so that the liver volume will be maintained at 1 to 1. 5 times normal (30 % to 40 % reduction from advent of ERT) and spleen volume to &le; 2 to 8 times normal (50 % to 60 % reduction from advent of ERT). For anemic and thrombocytopenic patients, with 2 to 5 years of <b>imiglucerase,</b> hemoglobin levels are expected to be &ge; 11 g/dL for women and children and &ge; 12 g/dL for men; and platelet counts in patients with an intact spleen, depending on the baseline value, should approximately be doubled.

40|$|AbstractAnti-drug {{antibodies}} are elicited by {{virtually all}} therapeutic proteins, and standardized assays {{are required for}} clinical monitoring of patients {{as well as for}} comparing antibody response to different therapeutic proteins in clinical trials. Velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase</b> are enzyme replacement therapies for the long-term treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disease resulting from an inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. We used state-of-the-art tools to develop a panel of assays for detection and characterization of antibody responses to velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase.</b> Highly-sensitive, direct bridging electrochemiluminescence screening assays were developed using samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease to set cut points. A mouse anti-glucocerebrosidase monoclonal antibody used as a calibrator was shown to have similar affinity and binding kinetics for anti-velaglucerase alfa and anti-imiglucerase antibodies. A quantitative radioimmunoprecipitation assay for IgG antibodies was developed to eliminate false-positives from the highly sensitive screening assay. Using 59 samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease, the confirmatory cut points were calculated to be 1. 42 ng/mL for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies and 3. 23 ng/mL for anti-imiglucerase antibodies. Isotype-specific indirect electrochemiluminescence assays were developed for IgE, IgA, and IgM subclasses. The IgE subclass assay was shown to be more sensitive than the confirmatory assay using sheep anti-glucocerebrosidase polyclonal antibody cross-linked with fragments specific to human IgE, with cut points for anti-velaglucerase alfa or anti-imiglucerase antibodies determined to be 0. 53 and 0. 55 ng/mL, respectively. An assay that detects inhibition in vitro of velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase</b> hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate in the presence of antibodies was developed to test for neutralizing antibodies. Using 52 individual healthy human donor samples and 35 samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease, cut points for the velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase</b> neutralizing antibody assays were determined to be 20 %, such that a sample with greater than 20 % inhibition of enzyme activity in the presence of antibodies was considered positive for neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, highly sensitive and equivalent methods were developed and validated to directly compare antibody response to velaglucerase alfa and <b>imiglucerase</b> treatments in patients with Gaucher disease, and may contribute to future internationally standardized assays for antibody detection in patients with Gaucher disease...|$|E

There are three commercially available enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) products {{for the treatment of}} GD type 1 (GD 1) : <b>imiglucerase,</b> velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa. <b>Imiglucerase</b> and velaglucerase alfa are produced in different mammalian cell systems; <b>imiglucerase</b> requires postproduction deglycosylation to expose terminal α-mannose residues, which are required for mannose receptor-mediated uptake by target macrophages. These steps are {{critical to the success of}} ERT for the treatment of visceral and hematologic manifestations of GD. Taliglucerase alfa is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved plant-cell-expressed recombinant human protein, using carrot root cell cultures. Furthermore, it does not require postproduction glycosidic modifications. It is indicated for treatment of adults with GD 1 in the US, Israel, Australia, Canada, Chile, Brazil, and other countries, and it is additionally approved for the treatment of pediatric patients in the US, Australia, and Canada and for the treatment of hematologic manifestations in pediatric patients with Type 3 GD in Canada and other countries. Our review focuses on the role of taliglucerase alfa in the pediatric population.

For anemic and thrombocytopenic patients, with 2 to 5 years of <b>imiglucerase,</b> hemoglobin levels are expected to be ≥ 11 g/dL for women and children and ≥ 12 g/dL for men; and platelet counts in patients with an intact spleen, depending on the baseline value, should approximately be doubled. Bone crises and bone pain but not irreversible skeletal damage will improve in most patients. Nonetheless, some features and some symptomatic patients apparently do not respond equally well and/or perhaps inadequately. The benefit for patients with the neuronopathic forms is primarily in improved visceral and hematological signs and symptoms. There are still several unresolved issues, the high per-unit cost being an important one, which have spurred the development of biosimilar enzymes as well as chaperone therapies currently in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTaliglucerase alfa is {{an enzyme}} {{replacement}} therapy approved {{for treatment of}} Gaucher disease (GD) in children and adults in several countries. This multicenter extension study assessed the efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD who were treatment-naïve (n= 10) or switched from <b>imiglucerase</b> (n= 5). Patients received taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60 U/kg (treatment-naïve) or the same dose as previously treated with <b>imiglucerase</b> every other week. In treatment-naïve patients, taliglucerase alfa 30 and 60 U/kg, respectively, reduced mean spleen volume (− 18. 6 multiples of normal [MN] and − 26. 0 MN), liver volume (− 0. 8 MN and − 0. 9 MN), and chitotriosidase activity (− 72. 7 % and − 84. 4 %), and increased mean Hb concentration (+ 2. 0 g/dL and + 2. 3 g/dL) and mean platelet count (+ 38, 200 /mm 3 and + 138, 250 /mm 3) from baseline through 36 total months of treatment. In patients previously treated with <b>imiglucerase,</b> these disease parameters remained stable through 33 total months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; treatment was well tolerated. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa safety and efficacy profile and demonstrate long-term clinical improvement in treatment-naïve children receiving taliglucerase alfa and maintenance of disease stability in children switched to taliglucerase alfa. Treatment was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals. This study is registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov as NCT 01411228...|$|E
