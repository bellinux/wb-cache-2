25|$|Hayden's {{efforts to}} gain {{approval}} for the Central Arizona Project continued into the 1950s.

California, was accepted by the court on January 19, 1953 and would take over a decade to <b>decide.</b> <b>In</b> other reclamation efforts Hayden cosponsored the Colorado River Storage Act of 1956, authorizing construction of the Glen Canyon Dam and three other water storage dams.|$|E

It would more broadly do so again in Juilliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421 (1884). The problem for the Willard court was how to craft a conditional order of specific performance, for any adjustment in the amount of paper currency tendered by Willard would have tacitly indicated that paper currency was valid (e.g., constitutionally issued).|$|E

25|$|The prince {{took steps}} in {{negotiating}} anti-Ottoman alliances {{first with the}} Habsburg Monarchy, and then with Peter the Great's Russia (see Russo-Turkish War, 1710-1711): upon the 1710 Russian intervention in Moldavia, the prince contacted Tsar Peter and accepted gifts from the latter, while his rivalry with the Moldavian Prince Dimitrie Cantemir (the main regional ally of the Russians) prevented a more decisive political move. Instead, Brâncoveanu gathered Wallachian troops in Urlați, near the Moldavian border, awaiting for Russian troops to storm into his country and offer his services to the tsar, while also readying to join the Ottoman counter-offensive {{in the event of}} a change in fortunes. When several of his boyars fled to the Russian camp, the prince saw himself forced to <b>decide</b> <b>in</b> favor of the Ottomans or risk becoming an enemy of his Ottoman suzerain, and swiftly returned the gifts he had received from the Russians.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} nekomata, another cat-like yōkai which {{is said to}} derive from a cat whose tail split into two when it grew older, there are folk beliefs across Japan about how aged cats would turn into bakeneko.

In Yamagata District, Hiroshima Prefecture, {{it is said that}} a cat raised for seven years or longer would kill the one that raised it. There are also many regions where when people began raising a cat, they would <b>decide</b> <b>in</b> advance for how many years they would raise it because of this superstition. Also, depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were killed by humans in a brutal manner would become bakeneko and curse that human. The stories of bakeneko are not only about aged cats, but are also sometimes stories of revenge against cruel humans.|$|E

25|$|The CFP franc is {{currently}} {{used as a}} euro pegged currency by three French overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia.

If the three collectivities decide to adopt the euro, the French government would make an application on their behalf to the European Council, and the switch to the euro could be made after a couple of years. If the collectivities fail to reach a unanimous decision {{about the future of the}} CFP franc, it would be technically possible to implement an individual currency decision for each territory.|$|E
