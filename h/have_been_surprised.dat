5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E

25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
500|$|This {{decision}} provoked major opposition {{both from}} {{the people and the}} church, especially the Bishop of Rome, which Leo did not take into account. In the words of Warren Treadgold: [...] "He saw no need to consult the church, and he appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> by the depth of the popular opposition he encountered". The controversy weakened the Byzantine Empire, and was a key factor in the schism between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Bishop of Rome.|$|E

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{reviewed}} the book favorably, and questioned whether Edward Lear would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to find his}} 1998 poem [...] "The Owl and the Pussycat" [...] had been censored from school library computer access due to online filters restricting users from reading anything containing the word [...] "pussy". The review wrote that the Heins powerfully argued {{that the notion of}} safeguarding youths from potential corruption had gone too far in the United States. Publishers Weekly concluded the author's thesis was a key work within the fields of both child psychology and civil liberties.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 2014, Stan {{performed}} both [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] and [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] on {{an episode}} of Vocea României. Shortly after her performance, juror [...] expressed how he was very disappointed by Stan's act, as she didn't provide live vocals. In an interview with Cancan, Stan confessed that [...] " [...] conditions of appearance at Vocea României were previously discussed with the producers of the show, so no one should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> about [...] performing playback". [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] was included on the track list of her Unlocked Tour (2014) and her Cherry Pop Summer Tour (2014).|$|E
500|$|The {{journey to}} Philadelphia was Mason's first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T. Pacheco {{in her article}} about Mason's role at Philadelphia, [...] "since Virginia's leaders {{regarded}} [...] as a wise, trustworthy man, {{it is not surprising}} that they chose him as a member of the Virginia delegation, though they must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> when he accepted". Broadwater suggested that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power, and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the Virginia Plan. They also did some sightseeing, and were presented to Pennsylvania's president, Benjamin Franklin. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, [...] "I begin to grow tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city".|$|E

500|$|Stan's first live {{performance}} of [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] was on 1 December 2014 on Neatza cu Razvan si Dani, which {{was followed by}} her lip-synced performance of the song on Wowbiz, in order to film some scenes for the single's accompanying selfie video. Following {{the release of the}} clip, Stan performed a stripped-down version of [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] on the Romanian radio station Pro FM on 2 December 2014, where she also sang Romania's national anthem backed with instruments played by Andrei Gheorghe, Greeg and Alexandru Cotoi. Stan was subsequently invited to perform on the Romanian version of The Voice on 12 December 2014. There, she lip-synced both [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] and [...] "Vanilla Chocolat". Shortly after her act, juror Tudor Chirila expressed how he was very [...] "disappointed" [...] of Stan's appearance, as she didn't provide live vocals. In an interview with Cancan, Stan confessed that [...] " [...] conditions of appearance on Vocea României were already discussed with the show's producers, so no one should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> about [...] playback-performance".|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, disappeared behind a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E

2500|$|Blunt {{has been}} {{critical}} of cuts to education funding, arguing that they will erode Missouri's future.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the controversy, the rebuilt Potsdamer Platz now attracts around 70,000 {{visitors}} a day, rising to 100,000 at weekends, and some critics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> {{by the success of}} the new quarter. Fears that the streets would be dead after 6 pm have proven false. At almost any time of the day, the place is alive with people. It is a particularly popular attraction for visitors: the [...] "Arkaden" [...] shopping mall is 180 metres in length and contains 133 shops and restaurants on three levels giving a total sales floor area of approx. 40,000 square metres, the lowest (basement) level being a food floor; there are also four major hotels, and Europe's largest casino (the [...] "Spielbank Berlin").|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} attacks on Flagler and Rockefeller and their firm was the 1905 publication of The History of the Standard Oil Company, by Ida Tarbell, a leading muckraker. She documented the company’s espionage, price wars, heavy-handed marketing tactics, and courtroom evasions. Although her work prompted a huge backlash against the company, Tarbell claims to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> at its magnitude. [...] "I never had an animus against their size and wealth, never objected to their corporate form. I was willing that they should combine and grow as big and wealthy as they could, but only by legitimate means. But they had never played fair, and that ruined their greatness for me." [...] Tarbell's father had been driven out of the oil business during the South Improvement Company affair.|$|E

2500|$|The shocked court {{rushed through}} another indictment, and twelve {{days later the}} pirates were tried on a {{different}} set of charges, this time on account of conspiring to steal the Charles II with piratical intent. Although legally dubious today, the 17th century court assumed the defendants had the legal burden of proving themselves innocent of mutiny, having been found aboard [...] "a ship...run away with." [...] As before, the court continually impressed the need for the pirates' conviction. Judge Hedges condemned the [...] "dishonorable" [...] former jury and instructed their successors to act with [...] "a true English spirit" [...] by passing a conviction, repeatedly reminding them to [...] "support...the navigation, trade, wealth, strength, reputation, and glory of this nation." [...] When the guilty verdict was read aloud in court soon after, no one could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Leo {{is said to}} have {{described}} mere image veneration as [...] "a craft of idolatry." [...] He apparently forbade the veneration of religious images in a 730 edict, which did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross. [...] "He saw no need to consult the Church, and he appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> by the depth of the popular opposition he encountered". [...] Germanos I of Constantinople, the iconodule Patriarch of Constantinople, either resigned or was deposed following the ban. Surviving letters Germanos wrote at the time say little of theology. According to Patricia Karlin-Hayter, what worried Germanos was that the ban of icons would prove that the Church had been in error {{for a long time and}} therefore play into the hands of Jews and Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Prince Henry the Navigator did {{not return}} to Lisbon to report to his brother, King Edward of Portugal, but rather sailed {{directly}} to Ceuta. [...] Henry assigned D. Fernando de Castro the duty of bringing his troops home and giving the account of the expedition and its defeat. [...] In Ceuta, Henry barricaded himself in his lodgings for several weeks, with hardly a word to anyone – evidently, Henry had fallen into a deep depression. [...] The new Portuguese governor of Ceuta, Fernando de Noronha, who had been appointed to succeed his father-in-law, the late Pedro de Menezes, arrived in Ceuta around this time. He must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear that a treaty had been signed to evacuate the garrison he had just been appointed to command. [...] With Henry ensconced in his room, not speaking to anyone, Noronha was not sure how to proceed.|$|E
