40|$|When weather {{conditions}} are damp, barley crops can be infected by fungi that produce amphiphilic proteins called hydrophobins. We postulated that these hydrophobins contaminate CO 2 bubbles during beer carbonation or shaking. These molecules prevent the dissolution or redissolution of CO 2 and, thus, stabilize CO 2 bubbles. These bubbles contain energy (overpressure) that is released when the beverage container is opened, causing the simultaneous nucleation of many bubbles, {{which leads to}} primary gushing. In this paper, we present validation of our hypothesis and show that dynamic light scattering (DLS) {{can be used as}} a tool to study the primary gushing phenomenon. The results indicate that both hydrophobins and CO 2 are necessary to induce gushing. Indeed, addition of a crude mycelium extract containing hydrophobin HFBI to different beverages such as beer, soda, and sparkling water led to gushing, whereas addition to still mineral water did not. Comparison of a commercial gushing and nongushing beer using DLS revealed the presence of particles with a diameter of approx. 100 nm in the <b>gushing</b> <b>beer.</b> According to our hypothesis, these 100 -nm particles should be nanobubbles stabilized by hydrophobin assemblages. The presence of these particles was also observed in all gushing beverages obtained after addition of the hydrophobin- containing mycelium extract. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The primary gushing is a {{spontaneous}} and wild overfoaming of over-carbonated beverages that {{occurs at the}} opening of the bottle without any shaking. Amphiphilic proteins present in the raw materials when the weather conditions are favorable for fungal contamination (high humidity and temperature) are responsible for this phenomenon that represents important commercial damages for the companies. These proteins are called hydrophobins and are produced by filamentous fungi. The poster will present the structure of this doctoral research and the first results obtained. The main objective of this research is to understand the mechanism and how can hydrophobins act to provoke this overfoaming. The first step is the production of hydrophobin at lab-scale to have suffisant amount to realize the experimentations. At this moment, the HFBI hydrophobin from Trichoderma reesei MUCL 44908 is produced at lab-scale, purified by Reverse Phase-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and detected by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight. The identification is realized by comparison with results published in the literature but the identification of digest peptides and the sequencing have to be purchased to apply the method on unknown hydrophobin present in the gushing products. In the same time, <b>gushing</b> <b>beer</b> and gushing malt are at disposal to develop detection methods to predict the presence of hydrophobins as early as possible in the process.

40|$|Primary beer gushing is defi ned as {{the wild}} and {{uncontrolled}} overfoaming of packaged beer induced by contaminated raw materials as barley and malt. It is generally admitted that most probably amphipathic molecules such as hydrophobins and non-specific lipid transfer proteins (ns-LTPs) are responsible for this phenomenon. These molecules are synthesized by moulds and by vegetal tissues respectively in order to modify the polarity of surfaces and the solubility of molecules. At present, hydrophobins are extensively studied as they are considered as the major responsible molecules involved in primary gushing. Although a strong reduction (more than 85 %) of the initial concentration of hydrophobins present in malt occurs during the brewing process, the residual quantity remaining in fi nished beer is sufficient to provoke the gushing of packaged beer and the subsequent dramatic commercial damages to a particular beer brand. This review compiles the relevant fundamental {{physical and chemical properties}} of CO 2 and experimental observations at laboratory and pilot scale. A plausible mechanism of primary gushing is presented. It is based on the effective role of hydrophobins association to CO 2 nanobubbles, acting as “nanobombs” and perhaps as “nucleation sites” causing effects from overfoaming to strong gushing depending on the concentration and the carbonation rate. In beer formation of CO 2 bubbles proceeds through heterogeneous nucleation. The rapid heterogeneous nucleation initiated {{at the opening of the}} container in excessively <b>gushing</b> <b>beer</b> suggests the the presence of catalysts to overcome the energy barriers. Since hydrophobin molecules are able to bind to carbonic acid, they prevent part of the CO 2 from dissolution. These structures will aggregate in timeframes of days or even weeks depending on the beer by forming nanobubbles of a typical critical radius. The internal pressure of these nanobubbles is proportional to the carbonation pressure of gaseous CO 2 in the container at filling (about 3. 0 till 4. 0 ATU of CO 2). At the opening of the container, the difference of partial pressure of carbonic acid in the bottle and in the atmosphere provokes the explosion of these nanobubbles and results in a strong gushing effect. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Beer lovers {{all over}} the world like to get their drink with a certain volume of stabile foam, which mainly depends on the beer style. However, {{sometimes}} this foam comes in form of a sudden, eruptive, and uncontrolled over-foaming (<b>gushing)</b> of <b>beer.</b> <b>Gushing</b> occurs after the bottle has been opened, without previously being treated inappropriately (exposure to high temperatures, shaking, or any other kind of agitation). According to recent scientific and professional literature, gushing may be induced by many factors, but fungal proteins are directly connected to this phenomenon. Gushing caused by fungal proteins—hydrophobins—is called primary gushing, and depends solely on raw material quality. Other reasons for extensive foaming after the bottle has been opened can be of chemical or technological nature {{in the course of the}} brewing process. This is called secondary gushing, which can be influenced and reduced by applying good manufacturing practice protocols...|$|R

40|$|Gushing is the {{spontaneous}} and wild overfoaming of over-carbonated beverages that {{occurs at the}} opening of the container without any shaking. Primary gushing is related to raw material contaminated by filamentous fungi. These latter produce amphiphilic proteins called hydrophobins that interact with carbon dioxide bubbles to produce overfoaming at the opening. Up to now, to determine the gushing tendency of a malt batch, most beer producers have used the Modified Carlsberg Test (MCT), where a determined volume of sparkling water is replaced by the same volume of an aqueous malt extract. However the precision and the reproducibility of this methodology have been subject to controversy. Recently a new method based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was developed in our lab to characterize the primary gushing potential of carbonated beverages. This technique was first applied only on the final product, i. e. bottled or canned beer. It appeared that the main difference between a gushing and a non-gushing beer was the presence of particles with a diameter around 100 nm only in the <b>gushing</b> <b>beer.</b> The objective of the present work was then to apply this new method on earlier stage products of the malting and brewing processes. The Congress Mash method was used to produce wort from non-contaminated and contaminated malts and from a blend of non-contaminated malt and contaminated barley. The MCT was carried out by replacing 20 mL of sparkling water from a 1 L bottle (7 g CO 2 /L) by 20 mL of the worts obtained from the different malt and barley samples. After three-day agitation (horizontal, 150 rpm, 20 °C), the bottles were opened and the overfoaming amount was determined by weighing. The wort/sparkling water samples were then centrifuged (4, 000 × g, 10 minutes) and naturally degassed (i. e. at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure) until the CO 2 concentration reached approximately 1. 7 g CO 2 /L (equilibrium value at 25 °C and under atmospheric pressure). After degassing, the size of particles present in the different samples was determined by DLS. The MCT results showed that worts produced from contaminated raw material (i. e. contaminated malt or blend of non-contaminated malt and contaminated barley) had a clear gushing tendency and DLS allowed to detect the presence of particles with a diameter around 100 nm only in these gushing samples. Our results thus tend to confirm the applicability of DLS as a new method to characterize the primary gushing potential of raw materials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Gushing is the {{spontaneous}} wild and uncontrolled overfoaming phenomenon {{that occurs in}} over-carbonated beverages. This phenomenon can only be disclosed after the opening of bottled or canned beverages and represents important commercial damages for the companies. Only few preventive and no curative techniques are currently available, but some detection methods such as the patented ELISA test exist or are in progress. The key factor for gushing is the CO 2 and mainly the bubbles sizes during the carbonation phase. There is a critical diameter for bubbles in a liquid above which they grow until they explode at the surface and under which they shrink in size until their complete dissolution except {{in the presence of}} a contaminant (in the latter case, the bubble becomes unable to solubilize because of the contaminant that adsorbs on the surface of the bubble). Hydrophobins are amphiphilic molecules produced by filamentous fungi, that are present when the weather conditions on barley fields are wet. These proteins can adsorb at hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces and it is widely recognized that they can be responsible for the gushing of beer and thus they can be defined as contaminants. A commercial Belgian beer produced with contaminated malt of the crop 2006 and the same commercial Belgian beer but produced with non-contaminated malt of the crops 2007 and 2008 were used to do a comparison between gushing and non-gushing beers. Two bottles of each kind of beer were opened and naturally degassed at atmospheric pressure for 3 days. Beers were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 minutes to separate the yeasts, and afterwards Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was used to determine the size of particles or bubbles remaining in those beers. A clear difference appears between gushing and non-gushing beers. Particles with a mean diameter of 115 nm were detected in the <b>gushing</b> <b>beer</b> but not in the non-gushing. These new results are in agreement with the following mechanism proposed for gushing and that is also based on recent results published in Brewing Science. During the carbonation step, nano-bubbles of CO 2 with a diameter smaller than the critical diameter are formed and stabilized by the self-assembly of hydrophobins. In a closed bottle, the stabilized nano-bubbles are impermeable to CO 2 because of the pressure equilibrium and thus they cannot grow. At the opening, the drop of pressure allows the bubble size to increase until it reaches the critical diameter and creates gushing: the stabilized nano-bubbles then act as nanobombs. The detection of particles with a mean diameter of 115 nm after degassing could indicate that the hydrophobin-contaminated CO 2 bubbles remaining in beer after gushing may coalesce until the critical size of CO 2 bubbles at 1 ATU (= 100 nm) is reached and may form stable nano-bubbles with an internal pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure. The use of DLS allowed to get new results that confirm our model for primary gushing. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobins {{are small}} surface active {{proteins}} produced by filamentous fungi. These proteins {{are famous for}} their potential to induce primary gushing. Primary gushing is an economically disastrous phenomenon which is provoked by the simultaneous presence of hydrophobins and gaseous CO 2 molecules in carbonated beverages. Although hydrophobins are well known for causing problems in the beverage industry, they could be useful in other technological domains and used as surfactants or emulsifiers, or for the immobilization of proteins and enzymes on solid surfaces, for surface coating of biomaterials and modification of electrodes. Based on {{the large numbers of}} applications of class II hydrophobins, the objective of this work is to study and analyse, both the positive and negative potentials of hydrophobins. First part {{of this study was to}} characterize the two class II hydrophobins: one is not yet being studied (HFB- 2 a- 2 from Trichoderma harzianum) and the other is being much investigated (HFBI from Trichoderma reesei). The second part of this study was to focus especially on gushing and the mechanisms behind solving gushing problem. As the new class II hydrophobin, HFB- 2 a- 2 from Trichoderma harzianum was selected and the characteristics of this hydrophobin were compared to those of HFBI from Trichoderma reesei. Both hydrophobins were extracted and purified from the mycelium of the fungi. Their surface activity and their ability to adhere to solid surfaces were studied. In both cases, HFB- 2 a- 2 was stronger than HFBI. Changes of the water contact angle were studied further for their adherence to the solid surfaces. HFB- 2 a- 2 showed higher ability to change the angle than HFBI. In order to analyse the differences between hydrophobins, their structure and self-assemblies were studied by Rosetta docking simulation. The results showed that HFB- 2 a- 2 has two hydrophobic patches while HFBI has only one. This indicates that such differences in the structure of these proteins result in different characteristics and it was concluded that HFB- 2 a- 2 is a better choice than HFBI to be used as a surface active molecule or for the covering of solid surfaces. Until now, not many class II hydrophobins have been characterized. In our group, the Centre for Microbial Malting Technology (M 2 T), KU Leuven, the characterization of new hydrophobins is in process and the objective is to develop a database with the different characteristics of these proteins. Such a database will be useful for the researchers to select the best hydrophobins for particular applications. Second part of this thesis was concentrating on the negative aspect of hydrophobins in the brewing industry. Since hydrophobins cause gushing, it is of high importance to solve this problem. First, the mechanism by which gushing is inhibited was further investigated. To this end, identified model substances were selected to study the mechanism of gushing inhibiting. For this, it was referred to the mechanism of gushing whichwas already explained in details by Deckers et al., 2012. They have demonstrated that gushing happens because of the interaction of gaseous CO 2 molecules with the hydrophobic patch of hydrophobins. Therefore, it was decided to select non-polar molecules in our study which will interact with hydrophobic patch (es) of hydrophobins. Through this interaction, gaseous CO 2 can no longer interact with the hydrophobins and consequently, gushing will be inhibited. This theory was confirmed by the decrease/ inhibition of gushing when specific non-polar molecules were added to hydrophobin HFBI. It was observed that the addition of some linear saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons with the same length as the hydrophobic patch of hydrophobins, inhibits gushing. In order to understand the mechanism of gushing inhibition and to characterize the interaction between hydrophobins and gushing inhibitors following techniques were used: Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Fiber Optic Surface Plasmon Resonance (FO-SPR), Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and particle size analysis. FTIR demonstrated that hydrophobins interact with non-polar molecules through non-bonded interactions. Moreover, the immobilization of hydrophobins on a solid surface using FO-SPR and QCM and subsequent interaction with gushing inhibitors indicated very clearly that there is a tendency between these molecules to interact together. Based on FTIR results, this interaction is not of a bonded type. Furthermore, particle size analysis revealed that non-polar molecules attach to hydrophobins and form larger particles which were not present before the addition. Since the interaction of hydrophobins with gaseous CO 2 is mainly responsible for gushing and these results indicate that non-polar molecules interfere with this interaction, the use of non-polar molecules is a solution for solving gushing problem. The effective non-polar molecules against gushing are the ones that are not potentially gushing inducers and have enough hydrophobicity to interact with hydrophobins. The next part of the study was concentrated on the application part of gushing inhibitors. A lipophilic hop extract antifoam was used to analyze the influence on gushing of beer. First, a hop extract antifoam was characterized and its influence on gushing provoked by HFBI was studied. Then the process for using this extract was optimized. The analysis of the hop extract antifoam by GC and GC-MS showed the presence of non-polar molecules, mainly long linear hydrocarbons and fatty acids. The saturated long linear hydrocarbons were gushing inducers while most of the fatty acids were unsaturated and did not induce gushing. Addition of the hop extract antifoam to sparkling water or wort containing hydrophobins, showed that this extract inhibited gushing of water and decreased gushing of wort. The addition to <b>gushing</b> <b>beer</b> had some influence. This indicates that when the hop extract antifoam is used to reduce gushing, the extract must be added before the interaction of hydrophobins and CO 2. After the hydrohobin-CO 2 complexes are formed, the hop extract antifoam is less active. The decreased gushing by hop extract antifoam is explained by the formation of an interface to which hydrophobins attach so that they are no longer available to interact with CO 2 and therefore, gushing is decreased. Furthermore, the hop extract antifoam was also evaluated in order to increase its interaction with hydrophobins. Since this extract provides a surface for hydrophobins to attach, by increasing the specific surface of the extract, higher numbers of hydrophobins will be attached and therefore, less gushing will occur. Better dispersion of the hop extract antifoam will increase the specific surface area. Further research was done to analyse the effect of better dispersion on the effect of hop extract antifoam against gushing. This was evaluated by using (1) high temperature, at the time of the addition of hop extract antifoam during mashing of malt, and (2) use of a magnetic field for dispersion. The addition of hop extract antifoam in the mashing step changed its properties which then became a gushing inducer. The high temperature in mashing breaks the hop extract antifoam matrix containing gushing inducer and inhibitor molecules. Since gushing inducers are the majority, they become available to physically interact with CO 2 molecules and induce gushing. As a result, addition of this extract should be limited to addition in a cold step of brewing. The magnetic field is used in some companies to disperse the hop extract antifoam, before entering the fermenters. The gushing potential of hydrophobins is decreased when the hop extract antifoam is first treated by magnet and then added to the wort. The best result is then obtained when only a low amount of the hop extract antifoam is treated and then added to the wort. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Gushing is the {{vigorous}} overfoaming of carbonated beverages when the bottle is opened. Primary <b>gushing</b> in <b>beer</b> is mostly {{caused by a}} group of proteins called hydrophobins secreted by filamentous fungi, which contaminate CO 2 gaseous molecules during carbonation and form nanobubbles. The influence of hop oil antifoam on primary gushing showed a complete suppressing effect in sparkling water, a decreasing effect in wort, and no influence on gushing-positive beers. This shows the importance of the critical point of addition of this product in the brewing process. GC and GC-MS analysis show that commercial available lipophilic hop extract comprises fatty acids, either saturated fatty acids (SFA) or unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (both free and incorporated in mono-, di-, and triglycerides), waxes (long-chain alkanes), and steroid compounds. Gushing analysis of each compound showed that SFA and UFA behave in a different manner regarding gushing. In contrast to SFA and trans-form UFA, cis-form UFAs do not induce gushing. Long-chain alkanes provide sufficient hydrophobic structures to interact with gaseous CO 2 molecules and induce gushing. Because hop antifoam molecules are hydrophobic, they interact with hydrophobins and prevent interaction with CO 2 and,consequently, inhibit the possibilities of development of the explosive nanobubble structure. status: publishe...|$|R

This problem represents important commercial damages for the companies since this phenomenon can only be disclosed after the opening of bottled or canned beverages. Only few preventive and no curative techniques are currently available, but some detection methods such as the patented ELISA test exist or are in progress. We demonstrated recently that the key factor for gushing is the carbon dioxide and mainly the bubbles sizes during the carbonation phase. There is a critical diameter for bubbles in a liquid above which they will grow until they explode at the surface and under which they will shrink in size until they have been completely dissolved except {{in the presence of}} a contaminant (in the latter case, the bubble becomes unable to solubilize because of the contaminant that adsorbs on the surface of the bubble). In beer, it is well recognized that hydrophobins are responsible for the gushing and they can be defined as the contaminants. Hydrophobins are amphiphilic molecules produced by filamentous fungi and are present when the weather conditions on barley fields are wet. Hydrophobins can adsorb at hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces and it is proposed in our model that they coat the CO 2 nano-bubbles and thus prevent their complete dissolution. As a consequence, they are a source of primary gushing by decapping of a bottle or opening of a can. The objective of this research is to show if a magnetic field can modify the self-assembly of hydrophobins and prevent them from coating CO 2 nano-bubbles. For this, we have used different extracts of gushing and non-gushing malt. The extraction is realized with a Tris/HCl buffer 170 mM (pH 9) containing 1 % SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate). The SDS is then removed by precipitation with KCl (2 M). For experiments at the pilot scale several liquids are studied: first, water as the simplest model and then <b>beer</b> without <b>gushing.</b> Gushing malt extracts are added to the liquids to simulate the <b>gushing</b> <b>beers</b> and the buffer is added to the control samples. To study the effect of a magnetic field during carbonation process, CO 2 is injected by a Venturi in the liquid coming from a container, and just after the Venturi, the carbonated liquid is submitted to a magnetic field. The objective is to assess the interaction of hydrophobins with CO 2 in water and in beer after treatment with magnetic field and to see if the hydrophobins can still stabilize the CO 2 bubbles to provoke gushing in the magnetically treated carbonated liquid.

40|$|The gushing of carbonated {{beverages}} {{is defined as}} a spontaneous wild and uncontrolled overfoaming upon opening of non-shaken bottles. As overfoaming is detected after bottling this results in significant economic and image losses to the producer. A mechanism referred to as secondary gushing is well understood and is due to the presence of external inorganic material or technical shortcomings. On the other hand, the very disastrous primary gushing mechanism is still under discussion although it is known it is related to the presence of fungal proteins, the Class II hydrophobins. Despite 25 years of research, several parts of the puzzle are still missing. Recent reviews on the phenomenon indicate that hydrophobins may stabilize gaseous CO 2 bubbles without explaining however how this occurs and how coated bubbles are made and gain stability. We studied how the two main factors, Class II hydrophobins and CO 2 interact to induce gushing. Class II hydrophobin HFBI was extracted from the mycelium of Trichoderma reesei MUCL 44908 with a Tris/HCl buffer, purified by RP-HPLC, detected by MALDI-TOF and identified by Edman amino acid sequencing. Sparkling water was used as source of CO 2. Considering the physico-chemical properties of both Class II hydrophobins and CO 2 and by performing molecular dynamics simulation, it was observed that CO 2 molecules interact with the hydrophobic patch of Class II hydrophobin and a detailed mechanism formation of coated CO 2 bubbles, the stabilized nanobubbles, was proposed. It occurs in several steps : migration of hydrophobins to the liquid-gas interface, contamination by contact with pure CO 2 atmosphere, concentration followed by crystallization, shaking causing imbalance of Henrys equilibrium in the closed recipient, re-equilibrium resulting in the nanobubble formation by closing due to the lateral forces (Young-Laplace forces). Finally, the closed bottle contains gaseous CO 2 nanobubbles stabilized by a crystalline layer of Class II hydrophobin. These solid structures are characterized by a consistent geometric value as their volume is determined by the critical diameter of CO 2 at the pressure in the bottle. The explosion of the bubble, i. e. the nanobomb effect, can be described by Avogadros law and even by Boyle-Mariottes law since temperature has a small influence. Nevertheless, primary gushing behavior in function of temperature does not fit with this theory in practice. Indeed, much more liquid than could be predicted is expelled from the bottle by increasing the liquid temperature at the opening. This indicates that beside the chemical binding, a lot of CO 2 is linked by low energy bonds that can be broken just by agitation energy. Since Class II hydrophobins are able to stabilize gaseous CO 2 bubbles, which must have a critical diameter at atmospheric pressure a method based on the dynamic light scattering was developed. This novel method allows to distinguish primary (hydrophobin) from secondary (kieselghur) gushing. It is based on the presence of 100 nm particles which areformed in the overfoamings after rest under saturated CO 2 (1 bar) only when hydrophobins are present. The 100 nm diameter corresponds to the critical diameter of CO 2 at atmospheric pressure. The method clearly indicates whether the <b>gushing</b> of bottled <b>beer</b> is either primary or secondary. This method was also applied to predict the gushing potential of barley and malt and can distinguish contaminated from non-contaminated raw materials. The target is to further propagate this method in order to confirm at industrial scale the good results obtained. Finally, the work describes some suggestions in order to prevent and/or to cure primary gushing.

40|$|Early 1900 ’s, Kastner, a German brewing scientist, {{reported}} a strong foam and beer overflow after opening normal beer bottles without shaking. This unwanted {{phenomenon known as}} gushing was also described later in other CO 2 supersaturated beverages (champagne, sparkling wine, cider, soda, mineral water) but seems to be most relevant in <b>beer.</b> <b>Gushing</b> represents severe economic losses and bad brand image. In the 1960 - 1970 s, some causes of this phenomenon were proposed and a fungal contamination of raw material by molds such as Fusarium sp. was suggested but molecules responsible remained unknown. In the 1990 s an amphiphilic peptide produced by filamentous fungi (Ascomycetes) was discovered and was called hydrophobin by Wessels et al. {{on the base of}} its amino-acids sequence. At the end of the 1990 s hydrophobins were tackled as the major responsible molecules for primary gushing by a research group in Finland but the mechanisms remained unexplained. More practically, Casey (1996) submitted the hypothesis that some organic materials formed a solid pellicle around CO 2 gas without explaining how and why. Still later research was intensified in Germany, Japan, Finland and other countries. Due to agricultural practice (grain humidity at harvest) and malting practice (germination temperature), the economic damages caused by gushing become more and more frequent (from one or two times pro decade earlier till three or four times pro decade now). Finally, the missing piece of the puzzle was added by Deckers et al. (2010) making the link between gaseous CO 2 (hydrophobic gas) and hydrophobins (hydrophobic patch) and by introducing the concept of “nanobombs”. Hydrophobins form a crystalline layer around CO 2 nanobubbles resulting in the appearance of surpressurized nanobubbles in a closed bottle. At opening of the bottle these surpressurized nanobubbles will explode due to their contact with the atmospheric pressure. This explosion generates the energy required for the formation of nucleation sites allowing some dissolved CO 2 to escape under an uncontrolled bubble form. Considering the physico-chemical properties of both hydrophobins and CO 2 at atmospheric pressure allowed us to develop a new predictive method for primary gushing applicable to all the production steps, starting from barley till bottled beer (2011). The understanding of this mechanism allows us to bring a definitive solution to a worldwide beer sickness. status: publishe...|$|R
