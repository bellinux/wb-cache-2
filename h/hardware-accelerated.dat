25|$|Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is a cross-language, {{cross-platform}} {{application programming interface}} (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API {{is typically}} used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve <b>hardware-accelerated</b> rendering.|$|E
25|$|Build 3718 (build date of November 19, 2002) {{was leaked}} on April 30, 2004. It {{included}} the DCE and some early <b>hardware-accelerated</b> alpha transparency and transition effects. As {{a demonstration of}} the DCE's capabilities, programs literally flipped into the taskbar and twisted as they were minimized.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, 2012, a port of Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) {{based on}} CyanogenMod 9 became available. It was a {{preliminary}} alpha build (Alpha 0) with some features including <b>hardware-accelerated</b> video playback, microphone and camera not functional at the time. It was updated to Alpha 0.5 around January 24, 2012 {{and then to}} Alpha 0.6 around January 30, 2012, bringing fixes and stability improvements.|$|E
25|$|At the February 2011 Mobile World Congress, Steve Ballmer {{announced}} a major update to Windows Phone due {{towards the end}} of 2011, which will include a mobile version of Internet Explorer 9 that supports the same web standards (e.g. HTML5) and hardware accelerated graphics as the PC version. Microsoft demonstrated <b>hardware-accelerated</b> performance of a fish-tank demo using a development build of mobile Internet Explorer 9 compared with slow performance on the November 2010 iOS 4.2.1 RTM of Safari on iPhone 4.|$|E
25|$|On January 11, 2011, the Chrome product manager, Mike Jazayeri, {{announced}} that Chrome would remove H.264 video codec support for its HTML5 player, citing {{the desire to}} bring Google Chrome {{more in line with}} the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on. Despite this, on November 6, 2012, Google released a version of Chrome on Windows which added <b>hardware-accelerated</b> H.264 video decoding. In October 2013, Cisco {{announced that}} it was open-sourcing its H.264 codecs and will cover all fees required.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer 11 is {{featured}} in a Windows 8.1 update which was released on October 17, 2013. It includes an incomplete mechanism for syncing tabs. It is a major update to its developer tools, enhanced scaling for high DPI screens, HTML5 prerender and prefetch, <b>hardware-accelerated</b> JPEG decoding, closed captioning, HTML5 full screen, and is the first Internet Explorer to support WebGL and Google's protocol SPDY (starting at v3). This version of IE has features dedicated to Windows 8.1, including cryptography (WebCrypto), adaptive bitrate streaming (Media Source Extensions) and Encrypted Media Extensions.|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of Chromium 12.0.742.0 on 19 April 2011 the {{interface}} incorporated many changes, the most significant since Chromium 6 was released. A multi-profile button was introduced allowing users to log into multiple Google and other accounts in the same browser instance. The new tab page was also redesigned and separated into four horizontally scrollable screens, providing access to most visited pages, Google apps, plus two identified pages. The page reload button was also redesigned along with {{minor changes to the}} URL bar. The first stable version of Chrome and Chromium 12 released was 12.0.742.91 which brought malware detection and support for <b>hardware-accelerated</b> 3D CSS transforms.|$|E
25|$|The human {{interface}} guidelines published by Apple for macOS {{are followed by}} many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow <b>hardware-accelerated</b> drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, {{making it easy to}} output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features. Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.|$|E
2500|$|Internet Explorer 9 is only {{supported}} on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, and was {{supported on}} Windows Vista SP2. It supports several CSS 3 properties (including border-radius, box-shadow, etc.), and embedded ICC v2 or v4 colour profiles support via Windows Color System. The 32-bit version has faster JavaScript performance, this being {{due to a}} new JavaScript engine called [...] "Chakra". It also features hardware accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, <b>hardware-accelerated</b> text rendering using DirectWrite, <b>hardware-accelerated</b> video rendering using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print pipeline. IE9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web Open Font Format. Internet Explorer 9 initially scored 95/100 on the Acid3 test, but has scored 100/100 since the test was updated in September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Unreal Engine 3 only {{supported}} Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms, while iOS (first demonstrated with Epic Citadel) and Android {{were added}} later in 2010, with Infinity Blade {{being the first}} iOS title and Dungeon Defenders the first Android title. OS X support was added in 2011. The same year {{it was announced that}} the engine would support Adobe Flash Player 11 through the Stage 3D <b>hardware-accelerated</b> APIs and that it was being used in two Wii U games, [...] and [...] Windows 8 and Windows RT support was added in 2012. In 2013, Epic teamed-up with Mozilla to bring Unreal Engine 3 to HTML5. Using the asm.js sublanguage and Emscripten compiler, they were able to port the engine to JavaScript and WebGL in four days.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, Google {{made the}} first update to Chrome OS's user {{interface}} since the operating system had launched, introducing a <b>hardware-accelerated</b> window manager called [...] "Aura" [...] along with a conventional taskbar. The additions marked {{a departure from the}} operating system's original concept of a single browser with tabs and gave Chrome OS {{the look and feel of}} a more conventional desktop operating system. [...] "In a way, this almost feels as if Google is admitting defeat here", wrote Frederic Lardinois on TechCrunch. He argued that Google had traded its original version of simplicity for greater functionality. [...] "Thatâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing, though, and may just help Chrome OS gain more mainstream acceptance as new users will surely find it to be a more familiar experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2012, a new build of Chrome OS {{offered a}} choice between the {{original}} full-screen window interface and overlapping, re-sizable windows, such as found on Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS. [...] The feature was implemented through the Ash window manager, which runs atop the Aura <b>hardware-accelerated</b> graphics engine. The April 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller, overlapping browser windows, {{each with its own}} translucent tabs, browser tabs that can be [...] "torn" [...] and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip, and a mouse-enabled shortcut list across the bottom of the screen. [...] One icon on the task bar shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks. [...] Writing in CNET, Stephen Shankland argued that with overlapping windows, [...] "Google is anchoring itself into the past" [...] as both [...] iOS and Microsoft's Metro interface are largely or entirely full-screen. Even so, [...] "Chrome OS already is different enough that it's best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved".|$|E
2500|$|ClearType in WPF {{supports}} sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing {{and hardware}} acceleration. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory. The {{extent to which}} this is supported {{is dependent on the}} video card. DirectX 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), alpha blending (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics including video can also be done with no computation {{effort on the part of}} the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card. [...] Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no <b>hardware-accelerated</b> text rendering capabilities.|$|E
