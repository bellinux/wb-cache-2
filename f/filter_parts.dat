In this study, we propose a novel probabilistic model for {{speech enhancement}} which precisely models the speech by taking into account the underlying speech production process as well as its dynamics. The proposed model follows a source-filter approach where the excitation and <b>filter</b> <b>parts</b> are modeled as non-negative dynamical systems.

This means that a base station can set apart a subset of the codes, the excess codes, that it will not use. In the case of periodic codes (such as in the TDD mode of UMTS), the existence of excess codes implies the existence of a noise subspace, which can be used to cancel the interference coming from a neighbor-ing base station. We introduce a SINR maximizing linear receiver to perform this interference reduction. In the case of aperiodic codes (such as in the FDD mode of UMTS), the noise subspace is time-varying. In this case, we intro-duce structured receivers that combine scrambling and de-scrambling operations with projections on code subspaces and linear time-invariant filters for equalization, interfer-ence cancellation and multipath combining.

40|$|We {{propose the}} {{extension}} of a previously submitted system to address the Audio Melody Extraction task. The original system {{is based on the}} decomposition of the signal into a leading voice and an accompaniment. For this submission, the model for the accompaniment is as in the previous one: it relies on a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of the spectrogram. The model for the leading voice is based on the original source/filter model, and includes some refinements such as an explicit smoothing parameterization of the <b>filter</b> <b>parts,</b> in order for the model to be closer to a natural sound production model. Preliminary tests show that our systems obtain results comparable to the systems provided last year. The GSMM extension proposed in this paper may also benefit from some bug removal from last year’s code. Although the proposed models do not lead to great improvements in the results, we believe the underlying semantics of the estimated parameters are easier to interprete and open this model for future indexing applications. allows to control the continuity of the melodic line. Two different models for the main voice part were presented: one which is directly derived from the Gaussian scale mixture models (GSMM) of the source separation litterature, and one which is based on an instantaneous mixture of all the possible basis elements in a dictionary, called the instantaneous mixture model (IMM). We further developed these models in order to include several important features, especially from a generative point of view: the proposed approach now include explicit smoothness of the filter part of the leading voice. The proposed extension for the GSMM has also been improved: last year’s program seemed to have some bugs that should be fixed for this year. This paper is organized as follows: first we introduce the models we consider for our submissions. The general principles for the estimation of the parameters are then discussed. At last, we give the results obtained on the development files for MIREX 2009 and comment the final results of the evaluation campaign. 1...|$|E

Its computational requirements, although less than those of more commonly known smoother algorithms, make full FLKS implementation impractical for atmospheric applications.

This paper {{introduces}} {{a new image}} representation for scene recognition, where an image is described based on the response maps of object <b>part</b> <b>filters.</b> The <b>part</b> <b>filters</b> are learned from existing datasets with object location annotations, using deformable part-based models trained by latent SVM [1]. Since different objects may contain similar parts, we describe a method that uses a semantic hierarchy to automatically deter-mine and merge filters shared by multiple objects. The merged hybrid fil-ters are then applied to new images. Our proposed representation, called Hybrid-Parts, is generated by pooling the response maps of the hybrid filters. Contrast to previous scene recognition approaches that adopted object-level detections as feature inputs, we harness filter responses of ob-ject parts, which enable a richer and finer-grained representation. The use of the hybrid filters is important towards a more compact representation, compared to directly using all the original <b>part</b> <b>filters.</b> Through extensive experiments on several scene recognition benchmarks, we demonstrate that Hybrid-Parts outperforms recent state-of-the-arts, and combining it with standard low-level features such as the GIST descriptor can lead to further improvements. ...|$|R
