40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the phenotypic relationships between milk production, traits indicating energy utilization, growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) in 793 lactating two year-old Friesian-Jersey crossbred <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> <b>Total</b> milk volume and yield of milk components protein, fat and lactose were calculated as the sum of spline function predictions. Measures of energy intake, energy balance and efficiency of energy utilisation were calculated using metabolisable energy (ME) prediction equations derived from individual animal measurements of milk production, condition score and liveweight. There was considerable variation in the energy balance measures, with 2. 5 % of cows having less than 15 days in negative energy balance out of 100 days and 1 % of cows being in negative energy balance for all 100 days. Higher producing cows had higher levels of GH and lower levels of IGF- 1 and a greater amount of body tissue depletion compared to lower producing cows. Cows with higher ratios of milk ME over maintenance ME had lower circulating levels of IGF- 1 and higher GH as well as greater body tissue depletion in the first 100 days of lactation. The relationship between energy balance, efficiency and IGF- 1 with fertility and the impact of these relationships on economic efficiency require further investigation...|$|E

In trial 1, 12 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated double switchback design with 21 -d periods. Intake of dry matter (DM) was increased 1. 2 kg/d by processing, but milk yield was unaffected. Processing did not affect apparent total-tract DM digestibility, but processing tended to lower starch and corn excretion in feces and reduced concentration of sieved corn kernel particles in feces. In trial 2, 42 Holstein cows were used in an 18 -wk randomized complete-block design. Intake of DM and milk yield were unaffected by processing, but milk fat percent was increased 0. 35 percentage units by processing. Processing tended to increase total-tract digestibility of starch, but reduced organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities. In trial 3, 30 Holstein cows were used in a 15 -wk randomized complete block design. There was no influence of mechanical processing on intake or lactation performance in this trial. Despite indications of increased starch digestion in two trials and increased DM intake in one trial, effects of processing corn silage on lactation performance were minimal with corn silage at the maturity and moisture contents used in these trials...|$|E

30|$|During {{lactation}} and gestation in high-producing dairy animals, methylneogenesis, DNA synthesis, cell division, epigenetic processes, {{and others}} important processes deeply depend on folate metabolism. While {{a supply of}} nucleic acids from microbial digestion might reduce {{the burden on the}} DNA cycle, gluconeogenesis and methylneogenesis is high in high-producing dairy animals, particularly during early lactation (Abbasi et al. 2018). However, in some cases, precursors of de novo synthesis of methylated compounds were found to be insufficient. In these cases, folate supplementation would improve the transport of one-carbon units. Consequently, a supply of both co-factors (folate and B 12) and methyl donors were essential for maximum dairy performance. Some studies reported that, in growing steers, duodenum folate concentrations were marginal, and non-gestating cattle had serum folate concentrations greater than that of gestating cattle (Arbeiter and Winding 1973; Tremblay et al. 1991). In <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> <b>total</b> serum folate level was noted to decline by about 40 % within the 2  months prior to a calving (Girard et al. 1989). Changes in serum folate concentration provide signs as to the relationship between folate supply and folate utilization in tissues and the change in that relationship during different physiological stages. Folic acid supplementation increased the placental and colostral transmission of folate to the calf. Other effects on blood hemoglobin, growth, birth weight, and feed intake of the mother were not found to be significant during the 10  weeks prior to birth. Other studies reported that folic acid injection promotes a significant increase in milk protein content in multiparous cows, but has no significant effect in primiparous cows (Girard et al. 1995; Girard and Matte 1998). Folate and vitamin B 12 concentrations in plasma increased during dietary supplementation of both nutrients (Girard and Matte 2005). However, during dietary supplementation of cobalt, vitamin B 12 serum level during early lactation was lower in primiparous cattles than in multiparous cattles (Girard and Matte 1999). This study also reported that in early lactation in dairy cows, serum vitamin B 12 concentration was lower, but serum folate concentration peaked, particularly during folic acid dietary supplementation. However, the situation was reversed 8 – 12  weeks after lactation, when serum vitamin B 12 was higher than serum folate in supplemented cows (Girard and Matte 1999). Previous studies reported that folic acid is also synthesized by ruminal micro-organisms, but folic acid from ruminal-synthesis is about 16.5 – 21.0  mg/day (Santschi et al. 2005), less than the folic acid requirement estimated recommended for dairy cows by the National Research Council (35  mg/day) (NRC 2001). Furthermore, ruminal microorganisms degrade around >[*] 0 · 95 of supplemented folic acid in dairy cows rations (Santschi et al. 2005). Thus, rumen-protected folic acid (RPFA) is necessary for high-producing ruminants.|$|E

Results Sub-group analysis showed {{that there were no}} differences in studies between randomized block design and Latin square/crossover design for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk production responses to the supplemental fat (all response variables, p≥ 0. 344). The supplemental fat across all studies improved milk yield, milk fat concentration and yield, and milk protein yield by 1. 684 kg/d (p< 0. 001), 0. 095 percent unit (p = 0. 003), 0. 072 kg/d (p< 0. 001), and 0. 036 kg/d (p< 0. 001), respectively, but tended to decrease milk protein concentration (mean difference = − 0. 022 percent unit; p = 0. 063) while DMI (mean difference = 0. 061 kg/d; p = 0. 768) remained unchanged. The assessment of heterogeneity suggested that no substantial heterogeneity occurred among all studies for DMI and milk production responses to the supplemental fat (all response variables, I 2 ≤ 24. 1 %; p≥ 0. 166). Conclusion The effects of saturated free FA were quantitatively evaluated. Higher milk production and yields of milk fat and protein, with DMI remaining unchanged, indicated that saturated free FA, supplemented at ≤ 3. 5 % dietary DM from commercially available fat sources, likely improved the efficiency of milk production. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to assess the variation of production responses to different saturated free FA, either C 16 : 0 or C 18 : 0 alone, or in combination with potentially optimal ratio, when supplemented in <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> diets...|$|R
40|$|Several commercially {{available}} devices automatically record feeding behaviour of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> on farm, but independent validation studies {{are often not}} available. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of the FeedPhone® device, developed in France by Medria, to record eating and rumination activities of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The FeedPhone is based on a tri-axial accelerometer placed on a collar, data being radio-transferred and processed automatically. The main activity (eating, rumination, or rest) is recorded every 5 min. Validation was performed on 7 lactating <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> fed on maize silage and concentrates for a total of 89 full day records. The actual times were determined by a reference method, by recording continuously the weight of the trough and the jaw movements at the minute scale. At the day level, the mean prediction error was 11. 5 % for eating time and 11. 1 % for rumination times, with low mean and slope biases (error mainly random). Eating and rumination activities are clearly distinguishable. This precision enables the detection of between-day variations of both eating or rumination times of 20, 10, and 5 %, at cow level, small-herd level (4 - 7 cows) and larger herd level (> 20 cows), respectively. This accuracy makes the FeedPhone valuable for studying relative variations of both eating and rumination times of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> fed on <b>total</b> mixed ration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of milk protein synthesis {{and development of the}} mammary gland (MG). However, the specific functions of miRNAs in these regulations are not clear. Therefore, the elucidation of miRNA expression profiles in the MG is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms of lactogenesis. Results Two miRNA libraries were constructed from MG tissues taken from a lactating and a non-lactating Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cow,</b> respectively, and the short RNA sequences (18 – 30 nt) in these libraries were sequenced by Solexa sequencing method. The libraries included 885 pre-miRNAs encoding for 921 miRNAs, of which 884 miRNAs were unique sequences and 544 (61. 5 %) were expressed in both periods. A custom-designed microarray assay was then performed to compare miRNA expression patterns in the MG of lactating and non-lactating <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> A <b>total</b> of 56 miRNAs in the lactating MG showed significant differences in expression compared to non-lactating MG (P Conclusion Our study provides a broad view of the bovine MG miRNA expression profile characteristics. Eight hundred and eighty-four miRNAs were identified in bovine MG. Differences in types and expression levels of miRNAs were observed between lactating and non-lactating bovine MG. Systematic predictions aided in the identification of lactation-related miRNAs, providing insight into the types of miRNAs and their possible mechanisms in regulating lactation. </p...|$|R

During the study period of 10 to 13 weeks postpartum, cows ranged from having reached their first ovulation to having reached their fifth. Before ovulation, the cows exhibiting standing oestrus or mounting activity with other oestrous signs were considered to be in oestrus. The total number of anoestrous ovulations was 136 (37 per cent). From the second to fifth ovulations, the percentage of cows expressing ST increased from 10 to 74 per cent, while the percentage of cows with ovulations accompanied by mounting oestrus increased from 1 per cent at the first ovulation to 19 to 24 per cent at subsequent ovulations. Seventeen relapses to anoestrous ovulation occurred in 14 cows that had resumed an oestrous cycle, and sixteen of these relapses were observed at the second to fourth ovulations. Cows exhibiting first oestrus at the third ovulation had a similar number of days open as at the second ovulation, but a significantly fewer number of days open than at the first, fourth or fifth ovulations. These results can be valuable for studying and improving the reproductive performance of high-yielding <b>dairy</b> <b>cows...</b>|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{farmers in}} Sweden usually grow feed grains for {{livestock}} but import protein feed from outside Sweden. Aside {{from the economic}} implications, some environmental issues are associated with this practice. We used life cycle assessment to evaluate the impact of local protein feed production on land use and greenhouse gas emissions, compared {{with the use of}} imported protein feed, for pig meat and dairy milk produced in Sweden. Our results showed that local production reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4. 5 % and 12 %, respectively, for pigs and <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Land use for feed production in Sweden increased by 11 % for pigs and 25 % for <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> but <b>total</b> land use decreased for pig production and increased for dairy milk production. Increased protein feed cultivation in Sweden decreased inputs needed for animal production and improved some ecological processes (e. g. nutrient recycling) of the farm systems. However, the differences in results between scenarios are relatively small and influenced to an extent by methodological choices such as co-product allocation. Moreover, it was difficult to assess the contribution of greenhouse emissions from land use change. The available accounting methods we applied did not adequately account for the potential land use changes and in some cases provided conflicting results. We conclude that local protein feed production presents an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but at a cost of increasing land occupation in Sweden for feed production...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effects of GnRH injection during early postpartum on uterine involution, length of postpartum period, number of services per conception, days open and calving interval in cross-bred Sudanese <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> A <b>total</b> of 20 cross-bred <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were used {{to examine the effects of}} GnRH on the above mentioned parameters. The cows were grouped into 2 groups: A (n = 15) and B (n = 5). Group A was further grouped into 3 subgroups (5 cows each). The first group was given a single injection of GnRH (200 ?g) i. m on day 7, the second and third groups were given the same dose of GnRH on day 14 and day 21, respectively. Cows in group B were employed as untreated control. The results of the present study showed that, injection of GnRH during the third week postpartum has no effect on uterine involution, whereas, injection of GnRH during the first or the second week postpartum significantly reduced (P< 0. 005 and P< 0. 05, respectively) the time taken for uterine involution, compared to the control. The postpartum period of the cows treated with GnRH as early as first, second or the third week postpartum was significantly (P< 0. 05) shorter as compared to the control. The shortest postpartum period was achieved by injecting GnRH during the third week. The cows received an injection of GnRH during the first, second or the third week postpartum has a similar number of services per conception (1. 00 ? 0. 00) which was significantly different (P< 0. 04) from that of the control (1. 40 ? 0. 20). Moreover, their days open and calving interval were significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) compared to that of the control. It is concluded that the use of GnRH during early postpartum improves the reproductive efficiency of cross-bred <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> ]]...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of postpartum intrauterine administration of flavonoids in order to hasten reproductive tract involution and to shorten the parturition-to-conception interval in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> A <b>total</b> of 40 Holstein cows (2 nd- 3 rd lactation; BC: 3 - 3. 5) were divided randomly into 4 groups [1 control group (T 1) and 3 treatment groups (T 2, T 3 and T 4) ]. Treatments consisted of one single intrauterine administration on day 10 postpartum of 90 mg (T 2), 180 mg (T 3) and 360 mg (T 4) of ultrapure flavonoids (20 ml). Ultrasonographic measurements of different reproductive tract anatomical structures were scored from cervix (length, width and thickness), uterus (diameter and thickness) and ovaries (length and width) during the postpartum period (day 10, 15 and 21 postpartum). As fertility parameters rate of return to estrus, pregnancy rate and calving-to-conception interval were scored as well. Pregnancy status was performed using ultrasonography (day 35 post-insemination). There were multiple differences (p 0. 05) in ovarian dimensions from T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4 groups during the postpartum period after ultrasonographic analysis at day 10, 15 and 21. Return to estrus index, pregnancy rate and calving-to-conception interval differed between T 1 and T 2 -T 3 -T 4 groups (p 0. 05). In conclusion, intrauterine application of flavonoids enhanced the cervical and uterine involution. Finally, although no significant differences among treatments, theintrauterine application of flavonoids improved the return to estrus index, pregnancy rate and calving-to-conception interval compared with non-treated <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> ...|$|R
