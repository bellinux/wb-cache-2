40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the old and}} {{new challenges}} to the theory and policy of free trade. The old challenges have sought to undermine the case for free trade by citing one or another type of market imperfection. Thus, the postwar period has seen two such challenges: Factor market imperfections were analysed in the 1950 s to 1970 s, product market imperfections in the 1980 s. The new challenges are twofold. One comes from the demands for fair trade as a precondition for free trade; the other, from the concern that free trade, while efficient, <b>immiserises</b> the unskilled in the richer countries...|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{analyses}} a hold-up {{problem in}} the EU enlargement process. EU-specific anticipatory investments of private firms lower the governments outside option. The EU {{takes advantage of the}} applicants' increased dependency and extracts more surpluses through entrance conditions that benefit it and impose huge costs on applicants. If private firms pay less than the full entrance fee in taxes, enlargement <b>immiserises</b> the entrant. While in practice an applicant may possess sufficient bargaining power to avoid immiserisation, the hold-up problem reduces its potential gains from joining the EU. This result suggests that previous calculations, ignoring both the applicants' costs of joining the EU and the dynamics of their bargaining position during the negotiations, overestimate the welfare effects of membership.

In the process these Bhil mass organisations have not only had to engage the modern establishment politically but also learn its arcane procedures of "rigorous " validation of truth involving statistical analysis.

The standard <b>immiserising</b> result of a foreign capital inflow {{has been found to}} be valid when the non-traded intermediary is solely used in the protected import-competing sector. However, if the export sector too uses the intermediary, the economy may experience an improvement in its welfare and a reduction in the urban unemployment level. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{interests}} of nationals (i. e., domestic residents) and owners of home-based foreign {{capital in the}} formation of a Trade Agreements (TA) are not antagonistic, except under rather particular assumptions on initial tariffs among potential members. Further, if initial tariffs are endogenously determined through an industrylobbying process, then TA that would have been <b>immiserising</b> in the absence of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), may be welfare-enhancing in the presence of foreign-owned firms. The rationale is linked to the effect that the entry of FDI has on the pre-TA tariff, through contributions to the incumbent government.

40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} {{human nature is}} {{universal}} and postulates {{the existence of a}} common, “true utility function” defined on attributes or “substantive goods. ” However, individuals have different household production functions so that the capacity to realize the substantive goods varies from person to person. Moreover, the limited life experience of an individual constrains his perception of his constraints and oppurtunities. As a result, individual maximization behavior is based on a perceived utility function and a perceived household production function. Personal development is a process of learning about the true utility or “happiness” function and the true household production function. If a virtuous circle of personal development is activated, imaginary constraints are overcome and real constraints are accepted. On the other hand, a vicious circle of <b>immiserising</b> development may occur if frustrations are misinterpreted...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} climate change has been so {{neglected}} by the mainstream development community {{should not be a}} surprise. Not only because most environmental issues have yet to be effectively mainstreamed within development policy and practice, but because climate change raises a series of uncomfortable challenges for the theory and practice of development. By not thinking beyond convenient frames of interpretation, we miss an important opportunity to effect more substantive change in preventing climate change from further <b>immiserising</b> the lives of the poor, by critically revisiting the role of conventional development strategies in producing the problem in the first place.

40|$|The {{question}} that drives this paper is: When {{can we expect}} firm upgrading by developing-country suppliers in global value chains will lead to improvements in labour conditions? To deal with this question we, (a) position firm upgrading in the global value chain approach, (b) investigate existing evidence and conceptualisations on how economic globalisation impacts on labour, and (c) develop some hypotheses on when we can expect firm upgrading and improvements in labour conditions to go together. We conclude that firm upgrading in developing-country suppliers in global value chains as a rule {{does not lead to}} improvements in labour conditions. Instead, the much broader and more forceful process of <b>immiserising</b> growth makes it very unlikely that workers in such relatively low-skilled production activities will enjoy improvements in labour conditions. Ethical sourcing may lead to improvements in labour conditions of core workers in final product manufacturers and key supplier firms, but it is as yet unclear to what extent such a business model can and will be disseminated. More generally, even though economic globalisation does selectively create new jobs, even labour conditions of core workers may be under pressure while the overall proportion of core workers appears to be declining.

40|$|Such {{questions}} as 'does FDI assist growth? {{how important is}} foreign relative to domestic investment? what is {{the relative importance of}} FDI and trade openness? ' are clearly important, given developing and emerging countries ' need to respond to the overtures of investors from abroad. One key characteristic in favor of FDI is its stability relative to the highly volatile capital movements that have characterised financial crises. In contrast to such volatility, FDI has been remarkably persistent across all sectors of the economy and is clearly a candidate for having boosted growth above that which would otherwise have occurred. On the other hand, a pessimistic view might accuse FDI of serving merely to transfer ownership from domestic to foreign agents, so that its effect on growth is, at best, neutral or, at worst, <b>immiserising.</b> Despite the scale and persistence of FDI, and the weighty literature that has emerged in the area of economic growth, {{only a small number of}} studies have investigated empirically the relationship between the two. Moreover, there has been relatively little investigation of the effects on individual economies, as opposed to more aggregate groupings. A further issue concerns the methodologies that have been used to investigate the growth effects of FDI. Most studies of economic growth hav...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation {{offers the}} {{potential}} to raise economic growth rates significantly. But at the same time, it also exposes firms and economies to intense competitive pressures. Declining terms of trade can result, and in some circumstances this may lead to <b>immiserising</b> growth, that is, an {{increase in economic activity}} which delivers lower standards of living. The result is growing unequalisation, both between and within countries. These developmental pitfalls can be avoided if the productive sector develops the ability to withstand the intense competitive pressures that are associated with Globalisation. This requires the ability to identify and appropriate ’economic rent’, and hence to escape from commodity production. A theoretical framework for understanding this process is laid out, and nine forms of rent are discussed. However, by their nature, rents are dynamic, so the developmental challenge also encompasses the need to identify and appropriate new forms of rent. This analysis applies to all sectors, and to rich and poor countries alike. The policy implications of alternative developmental paths are discussed in the conclusion. * I am indebted to my colleagues for their assistance: to Stephany Griffith-Jones in the discussion of finance rents; to David Evans and Adrian Wood for their views on the consequences of this framework for the global distribution of income and real wages; to John Humphrey, Khalid Nadvi and Hubert Schmitz for discussions on the issue of value chains and rent; and to Hubert Schmitz, Hans Singer and Adrian Wood for comments on an earlier draft...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a 3 × 3 full-employment H-O-S {{model with}} tariff-protection in the {{capital-intensive}} import-competing sector and inflows of FDI (foreign direct investment) to an export sector (using foreign capital {{as a specific}} input) within the ‘foreign enclave’ of a small open developing economy; whereas there are labour market distortion in the domestic organised tariff-protected import-competing sector and capital market distortion in the domestic unorganised sector of this typical economy. I have considered implications of sector-specific foreign capital inflows on national income (or social welfare, crudely however) of the economy under two different scenarios: when entire income from foreign capital is fully repatriated back to the source country; and when supply of FDI is a positive function of net return to foreign capital in the recipient country, coupled with labour-augmenting type technology transfer. It is found {{that the possibility of}} non-immiserising growth improves in the presence of labour market distortion in the organised sector while credit market imperfection in the unorganised sector deteriorates it. However in the presence of technology transfer, existence of labour market distortion is no longer a necessary condition for obtaining such result due to foreign capital inflows to the foreign enclave of this small open developing economy. Existence of output-generated increasing returns in the sector within the foreign enclave will not alter our results; while under the second scenario it will enhance the possibility of non-immiserising growth by raising the tax-revenue from foreign capital income in the host country through increasing the rental to foreign capital. These results are counter-intuitive with respect to the existing theoretical results suggesting <b>immiserising</b> growth owing to sector-specific foreign capital inflows using 3 × 3 or 2 × 3 full-employment models without any linkages. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays considering the role of private information in economic environments. The first essay considers efficient investments into technologies such as auditing and enforcement systems {{that are designed to}} mitigate information and enforcement frictions that impede the provision of first best insurance against income risk. In the model, the principal can choose a level of enforceability that inhibits an agent 2 ̆ 7 s ability to renege on the contract and a level of auditing that inhibits his ability to conceal income. The dynamics of the optimal contract imply an endogenous lower bound on the lifetime utility of an agent, strictly positive auditing at all points in the contract and positive enforcement only when the agent 2 ̆ 7 s utility is sufficiently low. Furthermore, the two technologies operate as complements and substitutes at alternative points in the state space. The second essay considers a planning problem with hidden actions and hidden states where the component of utility affected by the unobservable state is separable from component governed by the hidden action. I show how this problem can be written recursively with a one dimensional state variable representing {{a modified version of the}} continuation utility promise. I apply the framework to a model in which an agent takes an unobservable decision to invest in human capital using resources allocated to him by the planner. Unlike similar environments without physical investment, it is shown numerically the <b>immiserising</b> does not necessarily hold. In the third essay, with Kyungmin Kim, I examine the effects of commitment on information transmission. We study and compare the behavioral consequences of honesty and white lie in communication. An honest agent is committed to telling the truth, while a white liar may manipulate information but only for the sake of the principal. We identify the effects of honesty and white lie on communication and show that the principal is often better off with a possibly honest agent than with a potential white liar. This result provides a fundamental rationale on why honesty is thought to be an important virtue in many contexts...|$|E
