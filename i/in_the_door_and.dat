25|$|Regeneration is a {{historical}} and anti-war novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1991. The novel was a Booker Prize nominee and was described by the New York Times Book Review {{as one of the}} four best novels of the year in its year of publication.

25|$|Lovat held {{a council}} amongst his {{men with the}} Whig lairds preferring a siege to starve out the Jacobites, but he {{resolved}} to attack the town instead. However, before {{he could make a}} move Aurthur Rose, younger son of Rose of Kilravrock, along with his brother Robert and a handful of men had drifted towards Inverness in a boat. Rose of Kilravrock and Forbes of Culloden had already blockaded the town from the south east. Sir John Mackenzie, on learning of the imminent attack took up position in the Tolbooth, which was a strong building in the centre of the town, and served as the guard house. Arthur Rose had taken a sentry guard by surprise with his pistol in the dark and used him to get the door of the guard house open. Rose tried to storm in but the guard raised the alarm that he was an enemy and Rose ended up being crushed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> was shot dead in that position by the Mackenzies. He was the only fatality of the siege.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation {{started a}} program to {{eradicate}} hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything. This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated {{that there was a}} crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico. The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.|$|E
25|$|The Glenanne gang {{carried out}} a co-ordinated attack against two Catholic {{families}} on 4 January 1976 which left {{a total of five}} men dead, and one injured. Robert McConnell purportedly led the first masked UVF unit at Whitecross, County Armagh. The gunmen entered the Reavey home by the key which had been accidentally left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> opened fire on three brothers who watching television at the time, killing John and Brian outright, and wounding another, Anthony. The other members of the large family had previously gone out leaving the three brothers on their own. The getaway car on this occasion had been driven by James Mitchell with Lily Shields having accompanied him. Twenty minutes later at Ballydougan, another group led by Robin Jackson broke into the O'Dowd home killing three family members. Before succumbing to a brain hemorrhage shortly afterwards on 30 January, 17-year-old Anthony Reavey had given a description of the leading gunman which was said to have fit that of McConnell. The man Anthony Reavey had described was 5"11, aged about 25 or 26, wearing a black woollen balaclava hood, green anorak, and dark trousers; he was carrying a submachine gun. Ballistics tests show that the Sterling submachine gun used in the Reavey shootings was the same as that used in the Donnelly's Bar attack at Silverbridge.|$|E

25|$|Together with Agatha, {{he begins}} investigating. They {{discover}} a viscous substance {{left behind by}} the killer that the Doctor identifies as morphic residue. He concludes that the murderer is an alien in human form. The Doctor and Agatha question the guests while Donna searches the bedrooms for clues. While searching, Donna hears a strange buzzing noise. Opening the curtains, she sees, instead of a harmless, trapped bee like she expected, there is a ridiculously gigantic wasp outside. It smashes through the window and attacks Donna, but she fights back with light from a magnifying glass and it embeds its sting in the door but escapes through the window before the Doctor and Agatha arrive. The Doctor examines the wasp's sting embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> collects a honey like-substance from the sting. The alien kills the housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala, by crushing her with a gargoyle, and the Doctor, Donna, and Agatha chase it but it returns to human form before they catch it. When they regroup in the study, the Doctor deduces that the creature is a Vespiform, an extraterrestrial wasp species that lives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Suddenly, the Doctor is poisoned with cyanide in lemonade laced with bitter almonds. His Time Lord physiology allows him to detoxify, with Donna's help. The poisoning inspires him to add pepper to the dinner meal, since the piperine in it would act as an insecticide. As they eat, the guests hear the wasp but the lights in the room are blown out before the alien's identity is revealed. When the lights are restored, they discover that Lady Eddison's necklace has been stolen and that her son Roger has been stabbed in the back with a bread knife.|$|E
500|$|Though the Bruton Dovecote's date of {{construction}} is not known precisely, the structure was built some time between the 15th and 17th century. Architectural historian Lydia Greeves suggests that the building was once within the deerpark of Bruton Abbey and was adapted by the monks from a gabled Tudor tower. However, John and Pamela McCann, authors of The Dovecotes of Historical Somerset, claim that the structure was not built until after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. The authors claim that the Berkley family, who acquired the lands of the Abbey, constructed the building as a prospect tower. Dendrochronological dating commissioned by the National Trust [...] found that timber <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> window frames came from trees felled between 1554 and 1586.|$|E
500|$|The fourth episode {{features}} {{a scene where}} Mark jams his dressing gown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> is forced to hide naked in his new neighbour's flat. This sequence was Moffat's revenge for Bathurst's late arrival at the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London. Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst was naked. After being mistaken for a flasher, Mark is punched by his neighbour's brother. When he awakens he is confronted by a man (Kerry Shale) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be [...] "his very best friend". In the fifth episode it transpires that the man, who identifies himself as Dick, is the personification of Mark's penis.|$|E

500|$|Along with Wale and Gaga, songwriters {{who worked}} on [...] "Chillin" [...] {{included}} Gary De Carlo, Dale Frashuer, Roy C Hammond, Paul Leka, Andre Christopher Lyon, Makeba Riddick, Kirk Robinson and Marcello Valenzano. [...] "Chillin" [...] has influence of 1990s style rapping, and samples from the 1969 song [...] "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" [...] by Steam, and the 1987 song [...] "Top Billin'" [...] by Audio Two. The song is written in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 100 beats per minute, and is composed in the key of G minor. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club called it a [...] "throwback slab of electro-funk", with robotic new wave inspired vocals by Gaga. After starting with the Steam sample, the song has a stripped-down beat with a bass drum and synth-claps, and synthesizers on the verses and the sample being looped in the chorus, with Gaga interjecting her verses in-between. Lyrically it has Wale's name repeated throughout and the rapper talking about things he has in comparison to other people, opening with the line [...] "This how you start off '09, kickin' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> I'm everybody's problem". He also refers to fellow rapper M.I.A. with the line [...] "I'm the same way, M.I.A./ Me, Cool and Dre get high like planes".|$|E
500|$|As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} Caged Bird and {{its immediate}} sequel Gather Together in My Name, are [...] "very much {{concerned with what}} [...] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels [...] "the central myth of black culture in America": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, early in Caged Bird, that she, as the Maya character, [...] "met {{and fell in love}} with William Shakespeare". Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's [...] "The Rape of Lucrece", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. [...] Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in Caged Bird, [...] "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> save me".|$|E
