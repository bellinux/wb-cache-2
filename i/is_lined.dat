5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E

5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|Supertunica – {{the second}} robe {{with which the}} {{sovereign}} is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{room in the}} suite is the Mazarin Room.

50|$|The {{proper name}} as given in an annual {{report of the}} Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport <b>is</b> <b>Line</b> No. 8 Yūrakuchō Line (Hachi-gō-sen Yūrakuchō-sen). According to the Tokyo urban {{transportation}} plan, however, it is more complicated. The line number assigned to the section south from Kotake-Mukaihara to Shin-Kiba <b>is</b> <b>Line</b> 8, but that of north of Kotake-Mukaihara to Wakōshi <b>is</b> <b>Line</b> 13, which indicates the section is a portion of Fukutoshin Line which shares the same number.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with carpet. Internal doors are panelled timber.

5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} farther north, {{and closer to}} Grand Rapids, it <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width and over a mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} walls and ceilings of the observatory building <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> with fibre-cement sheeting with timber cover strips.

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Past the Atlantic City Expressway, the two-lane {{undivided}} road {{comes to an}} intersection with CR 559. From this point, Route 54 <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton. The road crosses New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line immediately before a junction with CR 561. After CR 561, the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of CR 542. As the road leaves the downtown area, the surroundings become more residential. Route 54 ends at an intersection with US 30 and US 206, where the road continues north as US 206.|$|E
25|$|Between 2014 and 2016, the <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> {{numbered}} {{based on}} the order of the dates the lines first opened.

5|$|Production {{designer}} Anthony D. G. Pratt {{was influenced}} by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where a hallway <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with {{a single}} layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. Cervical cytology tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> with glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
