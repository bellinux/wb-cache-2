5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings has evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that {{have given rise to}} its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas.

5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, {{which includes the}} northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned {{as a means of}} escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent}} that it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, {{to the point that}} security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E

25|$|At this time, John Willmore, a {{carpenter}} and joiner, constructed {{a house and}} workshop for himself. By 1809, the undeveloped remainder of the plot consisted of two nailer's workshops and a cooper's workshop with a knacker's yard behind. The Hurst Street frontage was filled with sheds. By 1821, No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15 had been converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> back to backs. No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15 were built about 1830. The terrace along Hurst Street was constructed in 1831.|$|E
25|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{feature is}} a pair of retractable, laterally compressed tusk whorls {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. These were not attached to any other bone, but fit <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> deep cavities on the palate and were free to move. The lower jaw was connected with the upper jaw in a way that made the tusk whorl thrust out as a dagger when the head was raised. The upper jaw, containing 30 teeth which decrease in size posteriorly, is well preserved in many individuals. Juveniles have six tusks, while adults have three.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a view-based method for object recognition and estimation of object pose in still images. The method {{is based on}} feature vector matching and clustering.

25|$|In early 1961, the Cross-Westchester Expressway (I-287) {{was opened}} to traffic, {{utilizing}} the Westchester Avenue corridor from White Plains to {{just west of}} Port Chester. Westchester Avenue itself was split into two one-way highways located {{on both sides of}} the new freeway, essentially converting Westchester Avenue <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> service roads. NY119 was moved onto both directions of the reconfigured Westchester Avenue and truncated to end at Purchase Street (NY120) following the opening of the expressway. It was cut back to the junction of I-287 and NY127 by the following year and to its current eastern terminus in White Plains in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|At {{the north}} end of the bridge, in East Potomac Park, the three roadways feed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> two-way bridges over the Washington Channel into {{downtown}} Washington, one carrying traffic (including northbound US1) north onto 14th Street, and the other carrying I-395 traffic onto the Southwest Freeway. The Metro line enters a tunnel in the East Potomac Park, and the main line railroad from the Long Bridge passes over I-395 and runs over the Washington Channel just downstream of the 14th Street approach before turning northeast along the line of Maryland Avenue. The original bridge ran to the junction of 14th Street and Maryland Avenue, with access to either for cars.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, the {{university}} submitted a revised {{plan for the}} arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station's freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend farther into the central business district at Nassau Street. According to {{the university}}, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the extended transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the expanded freight house <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> restaurants, preserving two original ticket windows for kitchen views, and using the wooden arrival/departure boards as overhead menus.|$|E

25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} required regular and, {{compared to}} a diesel-electric engine, frequent service and overhaul (often at government-regulated intervals in Europe and the US). Alterations and upgrades regularly occurred during overhauls. New appliances were added, unsatisfactory features removed, cylinders improved or replaced. Almost {{any part of the}} locomotive, including boilers, was replaced or upgraded. When service or upgrades got too expensive the locomotive was traded off or retired. On the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad two 2-10-2 locomotives were dismantled; the boilers were placed onto two new Class T 4-8-2 locomotives and the residual wheel machinery made <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Class U 0-10-0 switchers with new boilers. Union Pacific's fleet of 3-cylinder 4-10-2 engines were converted into two-cylinder engines in 1942, because of high maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|The Drivers Championship {{title is}} {{awarded to the}} driver who accumulates the most points {{over the course of}} the season. If there is a points tie for the series win, the {{champion}} will be decided based on the number of races won by each driver (if there is still a tie, it is based on second-place finishes and so on). Teams also compete for the Teams Championship, with the champion team being decided in the same manner as the Drivers Championship. For Teams Championship points scoring purposes, teams with four cars are separated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> two-car teams, while teams with three cars are split into a two-car team and a single-car team. The Teams Championship dictates the pit lane order for the following season.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} mid-1860s {{that the}} San Joaquin River and its {{surrounds}} underwent the greatest change they had seen in human history: the introduction of irrigated agriculture. As early as 1863, small irrigation canals {{were built in the}} Centerville area, southeast of Fresno, but were destroyed in subsequent floods. The vulnerability of the small local infrastructure led to the establishment of irrigation districts, which were formed to construct and maintain canals in certain areas of the valley. One of the first was the Robla Canal Company in the Merced River area, which went into operation in March 1876, but was soon surpassed by the Farmers Canal Company. The district built a diversion dam on the Merced, sending its water <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canals still in use today.|$|E
