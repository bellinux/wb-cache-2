40|$|Introduction: Sugar-sweetened {{beverages}} are {{a significant}} source of dietary sugar intake for both adults and children in Canada and around the world. Consumption of excessive amounts of sugar is a risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The retail food environment influences how individuals choose and access food. This study examines the impact of removing all sugar-sweetened beverages from a rural pharmacy on the mean <b>expenditure</b> per <b>transaction</b> for four product categories: minimally processed beverages; minimally processed snack food; ultra-processed beverages; and ultra-processed snack food. Methods: Sales data were obtained from a pharmacy in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, Canada, from September 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015. The NOVA classification system was used to categorize items for analysis. The primary outcome measure was mean <b>expenditure</b> per <b>transaction</b> {{for each of the four}} product categories. Results: Overall, the number of beverage sold decreased substantially (- 34 %) after the intervention. Prior to the intervention, ultra-processed beverages accounted for half of all beverages sold. The intervention removed this entire product category, so while minimally processed beverages and other beverages saw an increase in the number of items sold, this increase did not compensate for the removal of all ultra-processed beverages. During the same time period, the number of food products and prescriptions sold increased slightly (4 % and 9 %, respectively) and the number of non-food products sold decreased slightly (- 2 %). Revenue from beverages decreased by 20 % after the intervention, yet revenue from food and non-food products increased (17 % and 2 %, respectively). Revenue from prescriptions decreased by 2 % after the intervention. While there was no significant change in the percentage of total store revenue that food and beverages accounted for before and after the intervention, the food and beverage category as a whole makes up such a small fraction of overall store sales that these changes result in a relatively minor loss of revenue at the pharmacy. After the intervention, a larger proportion of transactions contained at least one minimally processed beverage; minimally processed snack food and processed snack food. The mean <b>expenditure</b> per <b>transaction</b> did not change significantly after the intervention. Conclusions: This study is one of the first to examine the impact of a restrictive retail food environment intervention on pharmacy sales. With the expanding selection of food and beverage products available in pharmacies, pharmacies play an increasingly important role in creating healthy food environments. Findings from this study suggest that this type of restrictive intervention can be implemented with a very minor loss to overall store revenue after the removal of all sugar-sweetened beverages. These findings also suggest opportunities for further research using sales data in different contexts and jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of transactions costs, no matter how small, arbitrage activity does not necessarily render equal all riskless rates of return. When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite <b>expenditure</b> of <b>transactions</b> costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets {{will be allowed to}} differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{says that}} {{economic}} surplus is created when {{the cost of}} litigation is foregone in favor of settlement, a theory flowing from the Coase Theorem. The cost-benefit analysis weighs settlement against the expected value of litigation net of transaction cost. This calculus yields the normative proposition that settlement is a superior form of dispute resolution and so most trials are considered errors. While simple in concept, the prevailing economic model is flawed. This article is a theoretical inquiry into the selection criteria of settlement and trial. It applies principles of financial economics to construct a pricing theory of legal disputes. In addition to probability and transaction cost, dispute risk must capture the concepts of weight of evidence, volatility of case disposition and confidence in assessment. In much the way cost of capital, a measure of financial risk, affects the valuation of firms, {{the risks associated with}} litigation and settlement imply a cost of resolution of which transaction cost is but one. By focusing on transaction cost, the standard model underestimates true economic cost. Valuation under uncertainty implies a risk premium or discount. Because the <b>expenditure</b> of <b>transaction</b> cost reduces uncertainty, transaction cost and risk adjusted valuation are in dynamic tension. Under this approach, settlement and litigation are different pricing mechanisms in the absence of market pricing, and are imperfect substitutes operating under uncertainty. Accordingly, this article rejects the normative axiom that litigation is inferior to settlement, a conclusion that has broad policy implications in the administration of justice...|$|R

Interest in the supply chain management concept by the construction research community arose from the successful implementation by manufacturing sectors to resolve firm and industry performance problems. Construction industry policymakers have appropriated the concept. Researchers tend to develop normative models to improve industry performance through supply chain integration. Such models are based upon the assumption of an homogeneous industry which is fragmented and composed of numerous small to medium sized enterprises. Policymakers are seeking positive economic models however policies are not based upon an explicit detailed {{understanding of the nature of}} the industry nor an explicit model of firm and industry performance. The positive economic model accepts that the industry is specialised and heterogenous with varied structural and behavioural characteristics across individual markets. The greatest difficulty with supply chain management in terms of construction research theory and practical application is that currently too little is known about these characteristics and how to describe them. Procurement modelling across the supply chain is fundamental to describing the underlying structure and behaviour of the industry. The industrial organisation economics theory was examined for its contribution and the structure-conduct-performance methodology was modified to develop a project oriented industrial organisation economic model for procurement in the construction supply chain. The model defines entities such as firms, projects, markets and firm-firm relationships and their relative associations. The model was static and nomothetic in approach and lacked the capacity to represent the duality of structure and behaviour of entities and individual procurement and project scenarios. The object-oriented methodology was used to address this and reinterpret the construction supply chain using the Unified Modelling Language. The model is interdisciplinary and merges industrial organisation economics and object-oriented methodology. Structural and behavioural model views of real world procurement in construction supply chains were developed based upon six major building projects in an Australian city. On thousand two hundred and fifty three procurement relationships were mapped using data collected from forty seven structured interviews and forty four questionnaires. The data analysis was qualitative and quantitative. Data display techniques were used to describe common themes and differences to develop an ideographic view of procurement. A statistical categorical data analysis provided a nomothetic view by comparing observed procurement results versus likelihood of expected results. The findings indicate that classifications of objects within the supply chain procurement model provides clues to structure and behaviour. Eight structural organisation maps of key construction industry commodities describe typical channels according to the type of commodity and the major groupings within the commodities. Supply chains can be classes according to attributes including uniqueness, property sector, importation and specialisation. Supplier firms can be classed by: commodity significance and countervailing power. The procurement relationships between firms can be classified based upon risk and <b>expenditure,</b> <b>transaction</b> significance and negotiation attributes. There are patterns of behaviour in the industry reliant upon a set of “if / then” type rules. This study concludes that the perception of the industry as fragmented, unstructured, unpredictable and high risk is a simplistic view of what is in reality a complex set of varied and numerous markets with degrees of predictability. Contrary to the traditional view, procurement is a strategic activity. This study highlights numerous research opportunities particularly in the area of interdisciplinary construction industry studies. Open Acces...|$|R

A treatment effects model is utilized, allowing {{for the analysis of}} the effects that price fairness perceptions exercise upon both the consumers' decision to realize a transaction as well as upon their consequent level of spending. Findings – Consumers do patronize stores and one important variable determining their level of spending is their perceptions of fairness underlying the transaction with a specific provider. Research limitations/implications – The small usable questionnaire sample may be considered as a limitation. However, the very satisfactory fit of the estimated model allows for the results to be a comparison basis with future findings. Practical implications – Analysis of price fairness perceptions provides new insights regarding consumer behavior, enhancing the analytical validity of typical household demand models.

Using a theoretical model, it was demonstrated that financial support for organic farming does not in principle contradict the Tinbergen Rule, {{even if there are}} other targeted policy measures which are more cost-effective in achieving specific environmental goals. Hence, organic farming should be included as an option within a mix of other policies as long as its costeffectiveness with respect to the overall set of policy goals is superior to that of a combination of other policy instruments. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental policies can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure.

However, little empirical {{research has been done}} in order to evaluate the economic performance of these payments. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} calculate the cost effectiveness of organic farming support in achieving environmental policy targets compared to other agri-environmental measures. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental measures can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure. Taking the Swiss agricultural sector as an empirical case study, cost-effectiveness of organic farming support and other single agri environmental measures was calculated. For this purpose, the sector-representative PMP model FARMIS was extended by three modules encompassing a) life cycle assessments for fossil energy use, biodiversity and eutrophication according to the SALCA methodology, b) public <b>expenditure,</b> including policy-related <b>transaction</b> costs, and c) uptake of agri-environmental measures.

In view of an average public expenditure on agriculture of 2. 5 kCHF per ha in Switzerland, these differences can be considered as marginal. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the cost-effectiveness of organic farming support is very similar to combined agri-environmental measures.

Land Use Policy, 31, 196 - 208 The economic efficiency of financial support of organic farming {{has been questioned}} by economists and policy makers. However, little empirical {{research has been done}} in order to evaluate the economic performance of these payments. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} calculate the costeffectiveness of organic farming support in achieving environmental policy targets compared to other agri-environmental measures. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental measures can be understood as a function of policy uptake, environmental effects, and public expenditure. Taking the Swiss agricultural sector as an empirical case study, cost-effectiveness of organic farming support and other single agri-environmental measures was calculated. For this purpose, the sector-representative PMP model FARMIS was extended by three modules encompassing a) life cycle assessments for fossil energy use, biodiversity and eutrophication according to the SALCA methodology, b) public <b>expenditure,</b> including policy-related <b>transaction</b> costs, and c) uptake of agri-environmental measures. The calculations revealed a slightly higher policy cost with organic farming support of 14 CHF/ha for a 1 % average improvement in the environmental indicators, compared to a combination of three single agri-environmental measures (11 CHF/ha), including both extensification of arable land and meadows. In view of an average public expenditure on agriculture of 2. 5 kCHF per ha in Switzerland, these differences can be considered as marginal. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the cost-effectiveness of organic farming support is very similar to combined agri-environmental measures. Furthermore, the model reveals that the cost-effectiveness of specific agri-environmental measures is higher when implemented on organic farms rather than on non-organic farms. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the dissertation {{is to develop a}} dynamic, inter-regional, and multi-sector general equilibrium model of the Belgian economy capable of analysing issues related to the environment, energy, fiscal policies and accounting for distributive effects between household groups. The dissertation focuses on BelMod, a computable general equilibrium model (CGE). BelMod is intended to act as an analytical and quantitative support for decision-making in the energy/environment field and fiscal policies. The tool would be in evaluating ex-ante the cost and benefit of different policies to be implemented. The winners and the losers may easily be identified. BelMod also aims at filling the gaps left by the other models currently used in Belgium, in particular by explicit bottom-up modelling of the three Belgian regions (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia) in the full integrated framework, by further disaggregating the production and consumption blocks, by distinguishing different types of households to study the distributional effects of environmental and fiscal policies. The effect of let’s say, carbon tax, may affect branches of activities, markets and institutions differently over time and space. Under the “Burden Sharing Agreement”, Belgium committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7. 5 % by 2008 - 2012 from the 1990 level. Therefore the efficient way of dealing with this issue requires an analytical tool which can take into account the interactions between institutional agents (regional governments, community’s governments, central government, households, firms and rest of the world), their behaviour and the time horizon. The most adequate tool to do so is the general equilibrium model. A CGE model such as BelMod requires a consistent, detailed and well structured database {{in the form of a}} social accounting matrix (SAM). A SAM is a square matrix which takes into account the production, consumption, revenues, <b>expenditures</b> and <b>transactions</b> of institutions at a given period of time. The reference year for our SAM is 2003. The SAM we built contains sixty two (62) branches of activity, sixty nine (69) commodities, three (3) regional governments, the French Community, the Central Government, the capital accounts and the Rest of the World. Finally, to illustrate the capabilities of the model we provide two scenario analyses. In the first policy scenario, we simulate the introduction of a carbon tax at 20 euro per ton of CO 2 emissions in 2013 - 2020 and 30 euro per ton of CO 2 emissions in 2021 - 2050. In the second policy scenario, we simulate a linear and gradual increase of the crude oil price to 150 US dollars per barrel in 2050. The increase starts in 2008 and the target (150 US dollars) is reached in 2050. Doctorat en Sciences économiques et de gestioninfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in equilibrium asset pricing. The first chapter studies the asset pricing implications of a general equilibrium model in which real investment is reversible at a cost. Firms face higher costs in contracting than in expanding their capital stock and decide to invest when their productive capital is scarce relative to the overall capital of the economy. Positive shocks to {{the capital of the}} firm increase the size of the firm and reduce the value of growth options. As a result, the firm is burdened with more unproductive capital and its value lowers with respect to the accumulated capital. The optimal consumption policy alters the optimal allocation of resources and affects firm's value, generating mean-reverting dynamics for the M/B ratios. The model (1) captures convergence of price-to-book ratios -negative for growth stocks and positive for value stocks - (firm migration), (2) generates deviations from the classic CAPM in line with the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns and (3) generates a non-monotone relationship between Tobin's q and conditional volatility consistent with the empirical evidence. The second chapter proposes a standard portfolio-choice problem with transaction costs and mean reversion in expected returns. In the presence of transactions costs, no matter how small, arbitrage activity does not necessarily render equal all riskless rates of return. When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite <b>expenditure</b> of <b>transactions</b> costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets will be allowed to differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The combination of randomness in expected rates of return and proportional transactions costs is a serious blow to existing frictionless pricing models. Finally, in the last chapter I propose a two-countries two-goods general equilibrium economy with uncertainty about the fundamentals' growth rates to study the joint behavior of equity volatilities and correlation at the business cycle frequency. I assume that dividend growth rates jump from one state to other, while countries' switches are possibly correlated. The model is solved in closed-form and the analytical expressions for stock prices are reported. When calibrated to the empirical data of United States and United Kingdom, the results show that, given the existing degree of synchronization across these business cycles, the model captures quite well the historical patterns of stock return volatilities. Moreover, I can explain the time behavior of the correlation, but exclusively under the assumption of a global business cycle...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study attempts to quantify and examine how changes in Population dynamics affect household portfolio choices (expenditure on food, monetary transactions, {{goods and services}} and non-cash expenditure) in Nigeria {{given the fact that}} Nigeria is going through a demographic transition. Previous efforts to assess impacts of Population growth have ignored the household expenditure responses, which has been far from being definitive on the transmission net effects on household portfolio choices. This study focuses on Nigeria with the aim of overcoming these defects and obtaining reliable information. The study establishes a link between demographic variables and household expenditure components using the Vector Error Correction Methodology. Next, the estimated equations are used to project the pattern of the different components of expenditure income based on three population scenarios generated from different assumptions on changes in fertility. Nonetheless, several counterfactual simulations were examined to enhance our understanding of the effects of Population dynamics on contingent choices. The results suggest that population dynamics in Nigeria can produce significant effects on the economy via the expenditure profiles of households. The results also suggest that other factors such as real per capita income, ratio of other expenditure categories to total expenditure influence growth of household expenditure components. The results of the study have some important implications for policy: • Pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policy has significant payoffs, as it avoids further constraints on household’s provision of essential social services, such as health services; • The rate of urbanization in Nigeria affects many categories of household expenditure, and therefore government policy of directing policies that would improve household <b>expenditure</b> on monetary <b>transactions</b> is likely to have significant payoffs in terms of easing the rate of pressure on households. • The results show how changes in age structure could be extremely relevant to the process of economic growth. Finally, there must be a sustainable momentum to boost monetary transactions among the people as a means of revitalizing the weakened social pillar. Doing so calls for a population rights approach to development planning that places people at the centre of developmental efforts. This will help in achieving the objectives envisaged for the social charter in the “NEEDS” framework. The determination for an appropriate mix of policies for managing Nigeria’s development requires prescriptions that recognize the structural linkages between the sectors. Such prescriptions must uniquely isolate, define and determine the nature and magnitude of the change variables that drive the development process. The necessity of such prescriptions should form the building blocks of national development planning and resource management. This entails reconciling planning with implementation and carrying out regular analysis of the challenges of population dynamics that underpins the NEEDS programme. ...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the administration, by Department of Health and Ageing and the Commonwealth partners, of the 2008 and 2011 Heads of Agreement for the management, operation and funding of the Mersey Community Hospital. Overall conclusion In November 2007, the Australian Government purchased the MCH from the Tasmanian Government in response to local community concern over proposed service changes at the hospital. Since 1 September 2008, the Tasmanian Government has managed and operated the MCH under two HoA with the Commonwealth, established in 2008 and 2011. Under the two HoA over the six years from 2008 to 2014, direct Commonwealth funding to Tasmania for the management and operation of the MCH totals $ 367. 3 million. As the only Australian Government owned and funded hospital within a health care system where the delivery of public hospital services falls within the responsibilities of the states and territories, the MCH is uniquely placed. As such, the operation of the MCH necessitates arrangements that sit outside the general approaches adopted by the Australian Government to fund the delivery of health services by state and territory owned public hospitals. The establishment and ongoing management of these arrangements have presented a range of additional costs and challenges for DoHA, representing the Australian Government as the hospital owner, and the two state government entities—DHHS and the THO-NW—which have responsibility to operate the hospital within the broader Tasmanian health care system. The recently expanded mandate of the Auditor-General, which provides for performance audits of Commonwealth partners under s 18 B of the Auditor-General Act 1997, has facilitated the ANAO’s examination of these unique arrangements. As the first performance audit involving a Commonwealth Partner, this report provides the governments and legislatures in both the Commonwealth and Tasmanian jurisdictions with our assessment of the administration of the arrangements governing the operation of the MCH. The audit does not, however, extend to commenting on the merits of the Australian Government’s decision to acquire the MCH from the Tasmanian Government in 2007 and its ongoing ownership as this decision reflects government policy. In general, the administration of the 2008 and 2011 HoA by DoHA and DHHS has been effective in facilitating delivery, at the Commonwealth-owned MCH, of a range of agreed clinical services, including those specified under the HoA. Under the day-to-day management of DHHS, and more recently, the THO-NW, MCH clinical services have generally been delivered within an effective clinical governance framework. In addition, the majority of these services met or exceeded established national targets and benchmarks, particularly for the emergency department, elective surgery, inpatient management and the High Dependency Unit. Notwithstanding these achievements, the cost of service delivery at the MCH, while better than other Tasmanian acute hospitals, is significantly higher than comparable mainland hospitals—primarily driven by higher staff counts per units of weighted activity, more costly medical and surgical supplies, dependence on locum medical staff and higher administrative overheads. The decision to assume ownership and continue existing service delivery at the MCH has come at an additional direct cost to the Commonwealth of $ 367. 3 million over the six years to 30 June 2014 and resulted in greater risk exposure as hospital owner. These additional costs and risks, which arise from the unique arrangements adopted for the MCH, underline the need for effective and ongoing monitoring. At present, system limitations make it difficult for DHHS to readily provide assurance regarding the use of some Commonwealth funds, while weaknesses in the MCH performance framework mean that DoHA is not well positioned to assess whether its ownership and funding of the MCH is effective and whether the Commonwealth is receiving value for money from the arrangements. There remains scope for:DHHS, in conjunction with the THO-NW, to improve existing systems to provide greater assurance regarding the use of Commonwealth funds; and DoHA to expand its existing performance measurement framework for the MCH program and to strengthen its analysis of reported performance information collected under the framework to better demonstrate {{the extent to which the}} program is achieving its objectives. While DoHA’s and DHHS’ administration of the HoA has facilitated the continuation of service delivery at the MCH, the differing objectives for the hospital held by the Commonwealth and Tasmania have not been fully reconciled: the Commonwealth’s objective primarily relates to the delivery of a set of core clinical services in place at the time the hospital was acquired, while Tasmania has sought to rationalise the delivery of hospital services in the state’s North West between the MCH and the NWRH at Burnie in line with the state’s health plan. To support the achievement of its objective, the Commonwealth has invested a substantial amount of direct funding, with the benefits to Tasmania extending beyond this amount, as it also receives a range of indirect financial benefits. Although the Commonwealth has retained the range of clinical services at the MCH outlined in the HoA, where it is safe to do so, Tasmania has also advanced the implementation of its health plan objectives for the state’s North West, with the MCH moving during 2012 – 13 from a 24 hour/seven day a week surgery facility to a mixed day and short stay surgery facility. Notwithstanding a generally sound working relationship, which has supported the ongoing administration of the arrangements governing the operation of the MCH, the differing government objectives has meant that DoHA and DHHS have expended significant time and resources revisiting issues relating to service changes and hospital costs. In particular, the mechanism specified in the HoA for changing its provisions—a Clinical and Financial Services Plan—has not been effective. In addition, while the HoA recognise the need to manage the MCH as part of Tasmania’s health network in the North West, how this principle should apply in practice to the integration of services between the MCH at the NWRH at Burnie has not been settled between the parties. There also continues to be disagreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania over responsibility for funding capital works at the hospital above the threshold of $ 250 000, and a compromise on this issue struck to enable the 2011 HoA to be agreed has not resolved this disagreement. The negotiation of any new HoA from July 2014 presents an opportunity to address these issues and establish a clear and agreed strategic direction for the MCH. Over the period that the Commonwealth has owned and funded the MCH, there have been persistent allegations reported in the Tasmanian and national media that Commonwealth funds for the MCH have been used outside the MCH contrary to the terms of the HoA. With regard to these allegations, the Tasmanian Government has stated that ‘the MCH operates its funding in accordance with the detailed and publicly available Heads of Agreement’. Further, DHHS informed the ANAO that it has ‘only used Commonwealth funds for the performance of this project [the MCH program]’. The ANAO’s testing of <b>expenditure</b> <b>transaction</b> samples over a four year period found no evidence to indicate that the MCH was using Commonwealth funds outside the HoA requirements in the categories of employee, supplies and pharmaceuticals expenditure, which have been the subject of such allegations. Nevertheless, the inability of DHHS and MCH systems to readily provide the ANAO with complete transaction listings for MCH expenditure on shared corporate services and cross-charging between the MCH and other hospitals meant that it was not possible during the audit to form an overall judgement on the appropriateness of the use of funds in these categories. There is, therefore, scope for DHHS and the MCH to improve existing systems to better inform hospital management and oversight, provide greater assurance to respective governments, and to more efficiently demonstrate adherence to DHHS’ obligations arising from the HoA. While the MCH performs well in comparison to other Tasmanian hospitals with regard to the cost of delivered services, it does not perform as well against comparable mainland hospitals. For example, while the MCH’s average cost per weighted separation 16 of $ 5125 was $ 1550, or 43 per cent, higher than the average cost for its peer group of mainland hospitals 17, it was $ 729, or 12 per cent, lower than the other Tasmanian hospitals. As outlined earlier, the higher cost of MCH clinical services in comparison to its peer group is primarily driven by higher staff counts per units of weighted activity, medical and surgical supplies, dependence on locum medical staff and administrative overheads. Some of these costs reflect structural factors within Tasmania that contribute, in part, to the higher cost of service delivery. However, there would be benefit in further exploring options to improve the efficiency of service delivery at the MCH by reviewing costs in particular areas, such as for locum medical staff. The Commonwealth’s objectives for ownership of the MCH, which DoHA terms the ‘core outcome’ of the HoA, have been narrowly defined as the continuing provision of the core clinical activities, with existing performance measures not directly addressing the impact of those activities on the community serviced by the MCH. Furthermore, the Commonwealth preferred that the HoA not define the performance or service quality standards—of a kind that would normally be included in a services contract with a private sector provider—that Tasmania is required to meet as the operator of the MCH. The categories of operational and clinical information reporting that Tasmania is required to provide have not been updated since 2008 and, while there have been some recent improvements in DoHA’s approach to its scrutiny of MCH performance information, the department’s analysis of data reported under the two HoA has not been undertaken in a consistent and structured manner. These factors limit the Commonwealth’s ability to assess whether the MCH is performing effectively, and whether it is receiving value for the significant amount of direct and indirect funding provided for the MCH program. Commonwealth ownership has resulted in the need to establish unique arrangements for the management and operation of the MCH, which have come at additional cost and complexity as compared to the standard model of providing Commonwealth funding for public hospitals through health care agreements. A range of direct and indirect costs have been borne primarily by the Commonwealth, with the quarantining of funding for the MCH from the CGC’s assessment for the distribution of the GST revenue pool also affecting the funds available for distribution to other states and territories. The ongoing administration of the HoA also necessitates a substantial commitment from administering agencies, relating to ongoing administration and periodic negotiation. Further, the Commonwealth continues to shoulder risk as the owner of the MCH, notwithstanding its day-to-day management and operation by Tasmanian Government entities. In recognition of the additional costs, risks and complexity arising from ad hoc arrangements of this type, it is to be expected that responsible agencies will continue to monitor and keep under review the implementation of desired objectives in order to be in a position to advise governments on the benefits of the current arrangements over alternative options. While the HoA support the continued delivery of a range of clinical services by the MCH to patients in its catchment, the strengthening of elements of the agreement and improvements in aspects of the responsible entities’ administration have the potential to improve overall hospital performance and contribute to enhanced accountability. In this respect, the ANAO has made five recommendations—two directed to DoHA, one directed to DHHS and two directed jointly to both agencies. These recommendations are designed to enhance the utility of the HoA, provide greater assurance regarding the use of Commonwealth funds and strengthen the measurement of achievements against the MCH program objectives. There are also a number of suggestions made in the report to enhance the administration of the HoA, most notably: resolving the issue of responsibility for funding of capital works at the MCH; clarifying the extent of community engagement necessary to underpin decision-making on the MCH’s service profile; and strengthening arrangements for the management of MCH assets...|$|R
