25|$|The chapel is a plain structure, {{built of}} gritstone with quoins {{at the corners}} and a slate roof. It has a small, {{hexagonal}} bellcote on the west gable. The side walls have two cross-windows with rectangular panes of glass and the <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> have windows with small diamond-latticed panes of glass. On the south side are two doorways with chamfered surrounds; over one door is a lintel dated 1703. At the north-west corner is a two-storey wing with a tall chimney stack, which was the school house. The building {{is surrounded by a}} drystone wall and the chapel's original cast iron gates survive.|$|E

60|$|The ruin {{itself is}} not of {{impressive}} size, {{and it is a}} château by grace of the popular fancy rather than through any right of its own; for it was, in truth, never more than the hunting-lodge of the king's Intendant, Bigot, a man whose sins claim for him a lordly consideration in the history of Quebec, He was the last Intendant before the British conquest, and in that time of general distress he grew rich by oppression of the citizens, and by peculation from the soldiers. He built this pleasure-house here in the woods, and hither he rode out from Quebec to enjoy himself in the chase and the carouses that succeed the chase. Here, too, it is said, dwelt in secret the Huron girl who loved him, and who survives in the memory of the peasants as the murdered sauragesse; and, indeed, there is as much proof that she was murdered as that she ever lived. When the wicked Bigot was arrested and sent to France, where he was tried with great result of documentary record, his château fell into other hands; at last a party of Arnold's men wintered there in 1775, and it is to our own countrymen that we owe the conflagration and the ruin of Château-Bigot. It stands, as I said, {{in the middle of that}} open place, with the two <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> and the stone partition-wall still almost entire, and that day showing very effectively against the tender northern sky. On the most weatherward gable the iron in the stone had shed a dark red stain under the lash of many winter storms, and some tough lichens had incrusted patches of the surface; but, for the rest, the walls rose in the univied nakedness of all ruins in our climate, which has no clinging evergreens wherewith to pity and soften the forlornness of decay. Out of the rubbish at the foot of the walls there sprang a wilding growth of syringas and lilacs; and the interior was choked with flourishing weeds, and with the briers of the raspberry, on which a few berries hung. The heavy beams, left where they fell a hundred years ago, proclaimed the honest solidity with which the château had been built, and there was proof in the cut stone of the hearths and chimney-places that it had once had at least the ambition of luxury.|$|E

50|$|Between September and December 1832 {{the church}} closed for repairs and {{during this time}} the {{verandah}} and portico with its classical masonry columns, typical of British buildings during this period were added. Very little vestiges of the original Dutch colonial architecture remain, {{with the exception of}} the clear storey windows and prominent <b>gable</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mortuary Chapel at Tubrid, {{reportedly}} {{built in}} 1644, {{in what is}} now the modern Catholic parish of Ballylooby, is long roofless.

50|$|The 1888-1889 {{section is}} 22 ft 6.7m long {{and has a}} coved timber ceiling with lattice ceiling vents and exposed timber tie beams.

The windows in the 1888-1889 section are tall vertical pivot in banks of three and have higher sills {{than those in the}} verandah walls of the 1871 building. The pairs of doors probably date to 1888-1889 and have stop-chamfered frames with flush-beaded panels to those in the 1888-1889 section.|$|R
50|$|Despite the demolitions and losses, {{the former}} water castle {{is still one}} of the most {{important}} and impressive castle systems in Bavaria. In addition to the partially preserved enceinte, three wall towers and the high bergfried have survived. The four towers are capped by steeply pitched gable roofs. The <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> are made of brick. The bergfried and East Tower have stepped gables.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the former}} castle, {{all that has}} survived is the castle gate in the southeast, part of the shield wall (once joined to the town walls in a {{continuous}} curtain wall), the round bergfried (occupied by bats and therefore no longer climbable), a <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> of the palas, which had cellars, and a small zwinger (now a terrace with views over the Main and Saale valleys and the Spessart hills).|$|E

50|$|A gable is the {{generally}} triangular {{portion of a}} wall between the edges of intersecting roof pitches. The shape of the gable {{and how it is}} detailed depends on the structural system used, which reflects climate, material availability, and aesthetic concerns.

50|$|In 1879 {{responsibility}} for school design {{passed from the}} Colonial Architect's office to the Department of Public Instruction, which engaged the architect Robert Ferguson until 1885, when he was replaced by his brother John. Robert Ferguson developed new designs, which remained in use until 1893, after which responsibility passed back to the Department of Public Works. Ferguson also favoured single-skin construction, but with studs exposed inside rather than outside. In their designs the Ferguson brothers incorporated roof fleches or vents at high level in the <b>gable</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
