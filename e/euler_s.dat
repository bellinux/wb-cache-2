40|$|Theorem 1 of <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> {{paper of}} 1737 'Variae Observationes Circa Series Infinitas', states the {{astonishing}} result that {{the series of}} all unit fractions whose denominators are perfect powers of integers minus unity has sum one. Euler attributes the Theorem to Goldbach. The proof {{is one of those}} examples of misuse of divergent series to obtain correct results so frequent during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. We examine this proof closely and, with the help of some insight provided by a modern (and completely dierent) proof of the Goldbach-Euler Theorem, we present a rational reconstruction in terms which could be considered rigorous by modern Weierstrassian standards. At the same time, with a few ideas borrowed from nonstandard analysis we see how the same reconstruction can be also be considered rigorous by modern Robinsonian standards. This last approach, though, is completely in tune with Goldbach and <b>Euler</b> <b>s</b> proof.

In particular, we provide a precise analytic sense in which the time t map for the Euler equations of an ideal fluid in a region of R^n (or on a smooth compact n-manifold with a boundary) is a Poisson map relative to the Lie-Poisson bracket associated with the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. The key difficulty in finding a suitable context for that arises {{from the fact that}} the integral curves of Euler equations are not differentiable on the Lie algebra of divergence free vector fields of Sobolev class Hs.

This technique is generalized to an arbitrary diffeomorphism group possessing a smooth spray.

The proofs use the introduction and complete computation up to sign of new numerical invariants which "count with multiplicities and signs" the number of representations up to conjugacy of the fundamental group of M to the unitary group U(n) (resp., the special unitary group SU(n)) which when restricted to S are conjugate to a specified irreducible representation, rho, of the fundamental group of S.
