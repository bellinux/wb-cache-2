25|$|On March 29, 2017, the Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, {{said that}} after the team's {{upcoming}} game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos {{said that he was}} not going to put any dates on his return, however, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that he was very pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} this first {{collection}} said that Schr√∂ter's abilities for composing were not equal to her potential. The reviewer felt that the songs had much spirit in them, but were not written {{in a way that}} brought this out. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that the performances of these pieces were helpful to understanding the depth of them. Ultimately, he blamed this deficiency on her lack of education, a real problem for women in this period of time.|$|E
25|$|At the Italian Grand Prix, Alonso {{was given}} a penalty for 'holding up' Massa during the final {{qualification}} session. Many in the Formula One 'paddock' were reported to disagree with the penalty and Max Mosley has since {{said that he would}} not have issued the same penalty as the race stewards. Schumacher reduced Alonso's lead to only two points after winning the race while Alonso suffered an engine failure in the late stages of the race. Despite a fourth-place finish for Alonso's teammate, Giancarlo Fisichella, and a flat-spotted tyre causing Felipe Massa to score no points, the race also saw Ferrari pull ahead of Renault {{for the first time in}} 2006. Polish driver Robert Kubica took his BMW Sauber to his first podium finish, in only his third race, but the race results were largely overshadowed by Schumacher announcing, during the post-race press conference, that he would retire at the end of the season. Afterwards <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that he would hold a position in the Ferrari F1 team for 2007, though he did not disclose what.|$|E
25|$|By February 1, six Southern {{states had}} {{followed}} South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession, declaring themselves to {{no longer be}} a part of the United States. On February 18 Jefferson Davis was sworn in as the President of the Confederate States. Meanwhile, Washington was astir with talk of coups and conspiracies. Stanton thought that discord would ravage the capital on February 13, when electoral votes were being counted; nothing happened. Again, Stanton thought, when Lincoln was sworn in on March 4 there would be violence; this did not come to pass. Lincoln's inauguration did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not say he would outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful. In Stanton, Lincoln's words were met with cautious optimism. The new President submitted his choices for his cabinet on March 5, and by that day's end, Stanton was no longer the attorney general. He lingered in his office for a while to help settle in and guide his replacement, Edward Bates.|$|E

500|$|... "The Ring" [...] portrays Disney as a {{corporation}} using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit, particularly through {{the portrayal of}} Mickey Mouse as a foul-mouthed, greedy, and physically violent company president. The episode received generally positive reviews, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was seen by 3.41 million viewers the week it was broadcast. The publicist for the Jonas Brothers specifically forbade reporters from asking the band about the episode; although Nick Jonas {{said they did not}} watch it, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> it was an honor {{to be included in the}} show.

500|$|For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post {{thought the}} film was [...] "undeniably easy on the eyes", and further added [...] "maybe too easy to prevent the mind from {{wandering}} and the lids from drooping." [...] Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them [...] "more ponderous than sensational" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from [...] "From Russia, With Love" [...] or [...] "You Only Live Twice" [...] or [...] "The Spy Who Loved Me" [...] or [...] "Moonraker." [...] This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top." [...] The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that [...] "For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot" [...] although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that the film is [...] "slick entertainment" [...] with a tone that is [...] "consistently comic even when the material is not." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{wrote that}} [...] "it's {{hard to make}} a 'true meaning of Christmas' story seem fresh.

Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that this episode was [...] "a modern, irreverent look at [...] ". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that Buck Henry and Andy Richter were both [...] "destined to play" [...] their roles. He also wrote that [...] " [...] Stritch wasn't as brilliant as she's been in previous appearances, but she's always welcome, simply because her character riles Jack." [...] Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode [...] "had all the trimmings for a holiday classic, though it fell just shy of that pantheon." [...] He added that [...] "this {{may not have been the}} 30 Rock holiday classic people were hoping for, but it was a solid, funny episode nonetheless." [...] Canning rated this episode 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Matt Selman and directed by Nancy Kruse. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 27, 2002. The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is at the movie theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that one should eat a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These trivias were subsequently included in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Kylie had {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Chris True from AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, giving it a mixed review. He said [...] "While the production values on Kylie's debut are dated at best and the tunes are nothing but standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum, there are some rather endearing qualities to it. Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al." [...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that Minogue would become a pop star and a [...] "European icon". Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave it three stars out of five. The stand out track, he said, was [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", as he said [...] "but anyone who denies 'I Should Be So Lucky' classic status has clearly let their tune detection muscles turn to flab". He also finished saying [...] "The bog-standard S.A.W. production renders Kylie as dated as that haircut on the album cover, and it's as loaded with variety as a loaf of bread, but the little Aussie pop rocket is already showing signs of personality and the record's quintessentially '80s charm ultimately wins through." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{press conference}} in Athens after the final, Kalomoira said that [...] "it was an honor... to {{represent}} Greece in this contest" [...] and thanked Greece because they supported her from the first moment she said she would compete. However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was the biggest thing that she has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in her life that will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to do so well in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the PSP port, Eric L. Patterson of Play {{was highly}} {{positive}} about the game's old-school mechanics {{and the chance to}} replay it with an improved localization and the Snow Queen route reinstated. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>say</b> that for fans of the PlayStation 2 Persona games, [...] " [...] could very well feel like a punch to the face and a boot to the crotch." [...] Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, said that the way Persona broke away from RPG norms through the communication with demons during battle made it essential playing for fans of the genre. He was generally positive about most aspects apart from its visuals. Game Informers Joe Juba, despite noting awkward navigation and the inability to appreciate character and enemies designs due to their small sprite size, generally praised the game for improving on the original game's flaws. Ben Reeves, giving a second opinion on the game as part of the review, generally shared Juba's points of praise, though found the minimap inadequate. GameSpot's Lark Anderson was more critical than most, praising the story and improved localization, but finding the combat, navigation and graphics fairly dated compared to both recent and contemporary RPGs. IGN's Sam Bishop shared critiques about the graphics with other reviewers, but enjoyed most other parts of the game, and particularly appreciated the inclusion of the Snow Queen route. RPGamer's Glenn Wilson and RPGFan's Neal Chandran generally echoed other reviewers' sentiments: Wilson cited it as a less enjoyable game than the PlayStation 2 Persona entries while still being a quality project, and Chandran called it [...] "a killer trip down memory lane with a pair of high-definition rose-colored glasses." [...] Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was also awarded RPGFan's Editor's Choice Award.|$|E
