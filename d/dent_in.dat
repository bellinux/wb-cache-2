5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds <b>Dent</b> <b>in</b> Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E

5|$|In 1669, the Jewels went {{on public}} {{display in the}} Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a {{cupboard}} {{and showed it to}} visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and, with the help of three accomplices, stole a crown, a sceptre and an orb. They were apprehended at the perimeter, and the items were recovered, though some had been damaged: the crown was flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a <b>dent</b> <b>in</b> the orb. Blood was not only pardoned, but also given land and a pension. It has been suggested that he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{graduated}} in 1843 from the United States Military Academy at West Point {{and served in}} the Mexican–American War. After the war, he married Julia <b>Dent</b> <b>in</b> 1848, and together they had four children. Grant retired from the Army in 1854 and struggled financially in civilian life. When the Civil War began in 1861, he rejoined the U.S. Army and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1862, Grant took control of Kentucky and most of Tennessee, and led Union forces to victory in the Battle of Shiloh, earning a reputation as an aggressive commander. In July 1863, {{after a series of}} coordinated battles, Grant defeated Confederate armies and seized Vicksburg, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River and dividing the Confederacy in two. After Grant's victories in the Chattanooga Campaign, Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general and Commanding General of the Army in March 1864. Grant confronted Robert E. Lee in a series of bloody battles, trapping Lee's army in their defense of Richmond. Grant coordinated a series of devastating campaigns in other theaters, as well. In April 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, effectively ending the war. Historians have hailed Grant's military genius, and his strategies are featured in military history textbooks, but a minority contend that he won by brute force rather than superior strategy.|$|E

Second seed Roger Federer defeated <b>Dent</b> <b>in</b> the fourth round {{to set up a}} quarterfinal match with longtime rival Andy Roddick, who overcame Gaël Monfils in a two-set match. Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Juan Martín del Potro, Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga made it into the quarterfinals. Del Potro defeated Nadal in the three-set quarterfinal match to reach the first ATP Masters semifinal of his career. Del Potro took the final set on a tiebreak after losing the second set. Murray faced Verdasco in the second quarterfinal in a rematch of 2009 Australian Open fourth round. Verdasco suffered an injury in the second game of the match and had to be seen by his physio. He was not in good enough shape to compete with Murray and eventually lost. Federer defeated Roddick while Djokovic moved past Tsonga to advance to the semifinals. Djokovic rallied back to defeat Federer in the first semifinal after losing the first set. The third seed however kept his consistency in the next two sets and won them. Murray edged past del Potro in the second semifinal to enter his second straight Masters final. Murray faltered in the second set of the match conceding two service breaks. However he recovered in the final set, gaining an early break of serve, to win the match.|$|E

Billy Dee Williams {{took on the}} role of Harvey <b>Dent</b> <b>in</b> Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.|$|E

Dents cause stress concentrations to develop which make dents susceptible to fatigue failures. Acceptance criteria of dents are currently only based on dent depth. To understand the behavior of <b>dents</b> <b>in</b> pipelines, a finite element parametric study was performed. Three dimensional shell element models were given elasto-plastic behavior for modeling <b>dents</b> <b>in</b> pipelines. Parameters modeled include dent depth, dent type, dent restraint, pipe diameter, thickness, grade, longitudinal stress, pipe support, and pressure at indentation. For the given parameters, the rebound behavior and stress behavior of dents were investigated. The displacement data were studied to understand the rebound characteristics of dents. Stress data were studied to determine failure modes of different combinations of dents and pipes. <b>Dents</b> reduce <b>in</b> size, or rebound, with removal of the force at indentation and pressurization. The amount of rebound is influenced by several parameters such as dent type and pipe wall thickness. Larger <b>dents</b> <b>in</b> terms of surface area of the dented region experience more rebound than smaller dents. Thinner pipes experience more rebound than thicker pipes. From the finite element modeling, the rebound characteristics can be predicted for a broad range of values for the various parameters. The study of the distribution of stresses <b>in</b> <b>dented</b> regions shows locations of possible fatigue failures. Two different modes of failure were found to exist. Longer <b>dents</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>dent</b> length are susceptible to fatigue failures in the contact region of the dent. Shorter dents are not susceptible to failures in the contact region, but can have failures away from the contact region <b>in</b> the <b>dent</b> periphery. Shorter dents have higher fatigue lives as compared to longer dents. The mode of failure of a dent is influenced by a variety of parameters. The influence of various parameters of the fatigue strength of dents is studied using rebound and stress behavior to develop better acceptance criteria of dents to improve the reliability of <b>dents</b> <b>in</b> pipelines...|$|R
