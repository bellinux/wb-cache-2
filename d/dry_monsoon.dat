50|$|The East Asian monsoon is a monsoonal flow {{that carries}} moist {{air from the}} Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean to East Asia.

It is driven by temperature differences between the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean. The East Asian monsoon is divided into a warm and wet summer monsoon and a cold and <b>dry</b> winter <b>monsoon.</b> This cold and <b>dry</b> winter <b>monsoon</b> {{is responsible for the}} aeolian dust deposition and pedogenesis that resulted {{in the creation of the}} Loess Plateau.

30|$|Observations in {{the tropics}} show that {{evergreen}} forests maintain relatively high humidity year round including dry periods (Bunyard 2014). The evergreen forests of the seasonal Amazon also maintain significant transpiration through the year (Myneni et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2016). Recent studies indicate that {{the ability of the}} Amazonian forests to maintain transpiration in the dry season {{plays a key role in}} determining the dry-to-wet season transition in the southern Amazon (Wright et al. 2017). The “dry-season” transpiration typically permits some rainfall and this retained moisture facilitates the return of the wet season. The region’s more balanced land-sea evaporation contrast also explains the absence of the abrupt switching of onshore winds found in <b>drier</b> <b>monsoon</b> regions (Zhou and Lau 1998). Overall, it appears that the switching behaviour suggested by the biotic pump appears to match observations, though other explanations have also been proposed (e.g., that 'shallow convection' maintains moisture locally (Wright et al. 2017)).|$|R

Conversely, the islands do not receive the upwellings (cold streams) that affect the West African coast, so the air temperature is cooler than in Senegal, but the sea is warmer, because the orographic relief of some islands, such as Santiago with steep mountains, cover it with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation where the humid air condenses and soak the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss, etc. On the higher islands and somewhat wetter islands, exclusively in mountainous areas, like Santo Antão island, the climate is suitable for the development of <b>dry</b> <b>monsoon</b> forest, and laurel forest as this vegetation Average daily high temperatures range from 26 C in February to 31 C in September.Cape Verde is part of the Sahelian arid belt, with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby West Africa.

Detachment 2, 1045th Observation, Evaluation and Training Group (OE&TG) was established at Kadena AB, Okinawa in 1955. Det. 2's mission was to conduct high-altitude, high-risk, clandestine logistics support flights to Tibet. It utilized a single C-118 Liftmaster marked as Civil Air Transport (CAT), a CIA aircraft owned by the United States Government. By 1959, the plane completed more than 200 overflights from its base at Saigon, South Vietnam to Tibet. However, the extremely high altitudes the plane operated at just to get to Tibet precluded effective support, as weight and fuel limitations meant that the plane had to fly with a diminished cargo capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Amazon has a {{well-defined}} wet austral summer monsoon and dry winter monsoon precipitation regime and experienced {{a sequence of}} drought events in the last 13 years. This study performs a comparative assessment of observed and predicted climate conditions during the three most recent drought events in the Amazon, in 19971998, 20042005 and 20092010, with emphasis on how these events affected the regional monsoon-like precipitation regime. A century long Negro River level time series at Manaus is investigated, applying extreme values theory for estimating return periods of these major drought events. Possible teleconnections of river levels at Manaus and sea surface temperature at remote regions are explored. Large scale oceanic and atmospheric conditions are investigated to highlight the mechanisms associated with the observed drought conditions, particularly during the <b>dry</b> <b>monsoon</b> season. Satellite estimates are used for diagnosing biomass burning aerosol and discuss possible contributions to the observed precipitation deficits in the 2005 and 2010 drought events during the <b>dry</b> <b>monsoon</b> season. The study is concluded with {{an analysis of the}} performance of seasonal precipitation predictions for the <b>dry</b> <b>monsoon</b> seasons of July to September 1998, 2005 and 2010 produced with the operational seasonal prediction system used at the Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies (CPTEC) of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE).
