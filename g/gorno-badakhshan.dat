Its proposal was drafted by and named after {{the former secretary of}} British India Sir Henry Mortimer Durand. When Pakistan became independent in 1947 however, the legitimacy of the demarcation was questioned and disputed by Afghans and the Pakhtun or Pashtun tribes. Afghanistan claimed the border was imposed upon their weak nation by stronger influences and favoured the establishment of another separatist state to be called Pakhtunistan. The Durand Line remained disputed until 1994 when it was finally accepted. A narrow strip of Afghan-occupied <b>Gorno-Badakhshan</b> territory called the Wakhan Corridor extends between Pakistan and Tajikistan.|$|E
