It begins by giving {{a brief review of}} developments after the Asian currency crisis, and argues that enhancing regional <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> both quantitatively and qualitatively will require: (1) upgrading surveillance capabilities in the region, and (2) creating a clear division of labor between regional institutions and the IMF. It also mentions the issue of membership and the background forces that have led to the duplication of similar forums in East Asia. Although the concern over crisis management is the central issue in East Asian <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation,</b> other issues such as exchange rate policy coordination and fostering regional capital markets are discussed as well.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{development}} of <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{in the region and}} make suggestions for future directions. The painful lessons of the financial crisis in the region that started in Thailand in 1997 have been the impetus for economic cooperation within the region. That the ASEAN+ 3 group was able to form stems directly from the crisis. Since then, a number of concrete <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> schemes have been initiated in the region, ranging from surveillance mechanisms, the Chiang Mai Initiative and the Asian Bond market. Ideas for further <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> are being discussed and debated. As the region becomes more integrated economically, a clear-cut financial architecture for regional cooperation will definitely be productive. In the next section, the roots of the Thai crisis are discussed and lessons drawn on how such a crisis can be avoided in the future. In section 2, the contagion to other countries and the IMF’s role are briefly described. Section 3 reviews the objectives of regional <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In section 4, several modes of regional <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> are presented. Finally, section 5 gives a summary and recommendations. 1. Roots of Thailand’s Financial Crisis in 199...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, {{not much}} {{attention}} {{had been paid}} to the need to promote regional monetary and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This is surprising as cooperation in finance provides more opportunities for "win-win" situations. However, the pace of monetary and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> has picked up in the postcrisis period. Countries in East Asia appear to have mustered a certain amount of "political will" to propel the process further. Cooperation has ranged from information exchange and surveillance, to establishing regional financing facilities and early warning systems. Beyond the Chiang Mai Initiative, efforts are also under way to coordinate macroeconomic and exchange rate policies mainly under the ASEAN Task Force on ASEAN Currency and Exchange Rate Mechanism of the AsiaEurope Finance Ministers group. As a regional development bank, the Asian Development Bank is supporting the efforts of its developing member countries to strengthen regional monetary and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> ...|$|R

This region has been relatively behind of regional coopera-tion however the experience of the financial crisis under the global-ized financial market and the need to find new growth dynamics call on their close <b>cooperation.</b> East Asian <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> would encourage <b>financial</b> stability within the region and spur economic growth by promoting investment.

Monetary and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> has focused on four architectural pillars (economic policy surveillance, crisis prevention, liquidity support, and bond market development), which can be consistent with the global architecture. However, progress toward full integration is likely to be gradual and experimental, given the lack of strong regional institutions, regional economic disparities, and the need to build political commitment to such a goal. ...|$|R

These include the Japan-ASEAN comprehensive Economic Partnership (JACEP), capacity building, and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Thailand’s {{support for an}} Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Japan is due to perceived economic and political gains through having many Free Trade Areas (FTA).

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] Regional <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in East Asia is {{proceeding}} with unprecedented intensity. Latest developments include two Asian Bond Funds, created by the regional central bankers group, and an Asian Bond Markets Initiative launched by the finance ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations member states plus China, Japan, and South Korea (or ASEAN+ 3). Some observers continue to attribute such cooperation to sharpened antagonism between East Asia and the West since the Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98. But this view overlooks a key internal driver: China's shift to a more proactive stance toward regional cooperation. Far from demonstrating an antagonism toward market-based financial systems, ASEAN+ 3 members are embracing more liberal rules for economic interaction in their creation of regional bond funds and markets. <b>Financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in East Asia is today motivated by factors that differ considerably from those observed {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the Asian financial crisis and the implications extend beyond East Asia...|$|R

Although CMIM funding was doubled to $ 240 billion, effective since May 2012, the swap amount has frequently been criticized as insufficient. Another fundamental issue that still needs to be agreed upon is the CMIM's role and how it fits in among existing regional and global financing facilities.
