60|$|The {{shore in}} these wild regions {{was not like}} the shore elsewhere. Firm as it looked, the garden {{ground in front of}} the reed-cutter's cottage was <b>floating</b> <b>ground,</b> that rose and fell and oozed into puddles under the {{pressure}} of the foot. The boatmen who guided the visitors warned them to keep to the path, and pointed through gaps in the reeds and pollards to grassy places, on which strangers would have walked confidently, where the crust of earth was not strong enough to bear the weight of a child over the unfathomed depths of slime and water beneath. The solitary cottage, built of planks pitched black, stood on ground that had been steadied and strengthened by resting it on piles. A little wooden tower rose {{at one end of the}} roof, and served as a lookout post in the fowling season. From this elevation the eye ranged far and wide over a wilderness of winding water and lonesome marsh. If the reed-cutter had lost his boat, he would have been as completely isolated from all communication with town or village as if his place of abode had been a light-vessel instead of a cottage. Neither he nor his family complained of their solitude, or looked in any way the rougher or the worse for it. His wife received the visitors hospitably, in a snug little room, with a raftered ceiling, and windows which looked like windows in a cabin on board ship. His wife's father told stories of the famous days when the smugglers came up from the sea at night, rowing through the net-work of rivers with muffled oars till they gained the lonely Broads, and sank their spirit casks in the water, far from the coast-guard's reach. His wild little children played at hide-and-seek with the visitors; and the visitors ranged in and out of the cottage, and round and round the morsel of firm earth on which it stood, surprised and delighted by the novelty of all they saw. The one person who noticed the advance of the evening--the one person who thought of the flying time and the stationary Pentecosts in the boat--was young Pedgift. That experienced pilot of the Broads looked askance at his watch, and drew Allan aside at the first opportunity.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) backscatter from floating {{lake ice}} is high, {{in contrast to}} low backscatter values from lake ice that is frozen completely to the lake bed (grounded ice). Knowledge of <b>floating</b> vs. <b>grounded</b> lake ice is useful for determining winter water supply, fish habitat, heat transfer to permafrost, and to observe changes in perennial lake ice status that could correlate with variations in local climate. Here, we compare calibrated L-band (23. 6 cm wavelength) single- and L-band quadrature-polarized SAR return to the backscatter intensity of C-band (5. 6 cm wavelength) SAR from <b>floating</b> and <b>grounded</b> lake ice over two regions in Alaska. Our primary goal {{was to determine if}} C or L-band is more useful to distinguish <b>floating</b> from <b>grounded</b> lake ice. C-band SAR showed far greater contrast between <b>floating</b> and <b>grounded</b> lake ice, making it the preferred wavelength for identifying lake ice regimes. L-band SAR backscatter was much lower from floating ice than C-band and it was different for our two study regions. Furthermore, since L-band is sensitive to ebullition bubbles trapped by lake ice (bubbles increase backscatter), this study helps to elucidate potential confounding factors of bubbles in efforts to detect <b>floating</b> vs. <b>grounded</b> ice using L-band SAR...|$|R
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>grounds</b> can be {{dangerous}} if they are caused by failure to properly ground equipment {{that was designed to}} require grounding, because the chassis can be at a very different potential from that of any nearby organisms, who then get an electric shock upon touching it. Live chassis TVs, where the set's ground is derived by rectifying live mains, were common until the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>grounds</b> {{can cause}} {{problems}} with audio equipment using RCA connectors (also called phono connectors). With these common connectors, the signal pin connects before the ground, and 2 {{pieces of equipment}} can have a greater difference between their grounds than it takes to saturate the audio input. As a result, plugging or unplugging while powered up can result in very loud noises in speakers. If the ground voltage difference is small, it tends to only cause hum and clicks.|$|R

50|$|To {{protect the}} {{operator}} and the equipment, and reduce power loss, an outer chassis must enclose the tuning circuit and its <b>floating</b> <b>ground.</b> The inner chassis {{can be reduced}} to a mounting platform within the outer chassis, elevated on insulators to separate the <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> from contact with the other electrical grounds. In particular, the inner tuning circuit's metal mounting chassis, and the metal rods connected to adjustment knobs on the outer chassis must all be kept separate from the surface touched by the operator and from direct electrical contact with the transmitter's ground on its connection cable. This puts difficult constraints on the tuner's construction.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{equipment}} may {{be designed}} with a <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> {{for one of}} several reasons. One is safety. For example, a low voltage DC power supply, such as a mobile phone charger {{is connected to the}} mains through a transformer of one type or another, and there is no direct electrical connection between the current return path on the low-voltage side and physical ground (earth). Ensuring that there is no electrical connection between mains voltage and the low-voltage plug makes it much easier to guarantee safety of the supply. It also allows the charger to safely only connect to live and neutral, which allows a two-prong plug in countries where this is relevant. Indeed, any home appliance with a two-prong plug must have a <b>floating</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

This paper gives a short review of the CFTA and mainly focuses on the synthetic <b>floating</b> and <b>grounded</b> passive element design, which can also be electronically controllable. Except the design of synthetic inductors, also possible realizations of <b>floating</b> and <b>grounded</b> capacitors and resistors are described, where the value of these passive elements can be adjusted by means of active elements’ parameters. For the design of the corresponding circuit realizations, the Mason-Coates signal flow graph approach is used.

50|$|The {{development}} of this detector has required devoted electronics circuitry, especially when the signal is {{picked up by the}} anode at high bias, because the floating current amplified must be coupled at full bandwidth to the ground amplifier and video display circuits (developed by ElectroScan). An alternative is to bias the cathode with a negative potential and pickup the signal from the anode at <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> without the need for coupling between amplifier stages. However, this would require extra precaution to protect users from exposure to a high potential at the specimen stage.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, a <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> {{can help}} {{eliminate}} ground loops, which reduces the noise coupled to the system. An {{example of such}} a configuration is shown in the image on the right. Systems isolated in this manner can and do drift in potential and if the transformer is capable of supplying much power, they can be dangerous. This is particularly likely if the floated system is near high voltage power lines. To reduce the danger of electric shocks, the chassis of the instruments are usually connected separately to Earth ground.|$|E

50|$|In analog video, mains hum {{can be seen}} as {{hum bars}} (bands of {{slightly}} different brightness) scrolling vertically up the screen. These are frequently seen with video projectors where the display device has its case grounded via a 3-prong plug, and the other components have a <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> connected to the CATV coax. In this situation the video cable is grounded at the projector end to the home electrical system, and at the other end to the cable TV's ground, inducing a current through the cable which distorts the picture. This problem can not be solved by a simple isolating transformer in the video feed, as the video signal has a net DC component, which varies. The isolation must be put in the CATV RF feed instead. The internal design of the CATV box should have provided for this.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{unbalanced}} tuner is {{fed with}} a balanced {{line from a}} balun instead of directly from the transmitter, then as usual its normal antenna connection [...] - [...] the center wire of its output coaxial cable [...] - [...] provides the signal to the antenna, for one side. However the ground side of that same output connection must feed an equal and opposite current {{to the other side}} of the antenna. The antenna and transmitter ground voltages lie halfway between the two [...] "hot" [...] feeds. In order to manage this, the common side (chassis ground) of the tuner circuit must [...] "float", as it will be used to feed one of the [...] "hot" [...] output terminals. The high voltages present between this <b>floating</b> <b>ground</b> and the transmitter and antenna grounds can lead to arcing and electric shock.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{alternative}} {{that has been}} implemented at the laboratory stage is by {{the application of a}} high bias at the anode but by pickup of the signals from the cathode at <b>floating</b> <b>ground,</b> as shown in the [...] Concentric electrodes (E2, E3, E4) are made on a copper-coated fiberglass printed circuit board (PCB) and a copper wire (E1) is added {{at the center of the}} disk. The anode is made again from the same PCB with a conical hole (400 micrometres) to act as a pressure limiting aperture in the ESEM. The exposed fiberglass material inside the aperture cone together with its surface above are coated with silver paint in continuity with the copper material of the anode electrode (E0), which is held at high potential. The cathode electrodes are independently connected to ground amplifiers, which, in fact, can be biased with low voltage directly from the amplifier power supplies in the range of ±15 volts without any further coupling required. On account of the induction mechanism operating behind the GDD, this configuration is equivalent to the previous diagram, except for the inverted signal that is electronically restored. While electrode E0 is held at 250 V, meaningful imaging is done as shown by a [...] with composition of signals from various electrodes at two pressures of supplied air. All images show part of the central copper wire (E1), exposed fiber-glass (FG, middle), and copper (part of E2) with some silver paint used to attach the wire. The close resemblance of (a) with (b) at low pressure and (c) with (d) at high pressure is a manifestation of the principle of equivalence by induction.
