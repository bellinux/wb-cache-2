Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where the buyer takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for <b>hire-purchase</b> and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E

Managing director Takeo Fujisawa initiated a direct-mail campaign to the country's 50,000 bicycle dealers, generating about 30,000 replies, from which 13,000 dealers were chosen. He also instigated a <b>hire-purchase</b> scheme to allow customers to spread payments across 12 months. Honda shipped 6,000 Cub F units in October 1952, and 9,000 in December.|$|E
25|$|More {{industrial}} estates and districts were built. This was {{because there was}} insufficient land for industrial development, leading to a rise in land rent. In 1971, every square metre of industrial land was sold at HK$1,329.09 at auctions. In this period, the industrial areas were spread all over the city, especially in the New Territories, where new towns such as Tuen Mun and Shatin, were built. A <b>hire-purchase</b> plan was also adopted to relieve pressure from buying land for industrial uses.|$|E

50|$|If {{the buyer}} {{defaults}} in paying the installments, the owner may repossess the goods, a vendor protection not available with unsecured-consumer-credit systems. HP is frequently advantageous to consumers because it spreads {{the cost of}} expensive items over an extended time period. Business consumers may find the different balance sheet and taxation treatment of <b>hire-purchased</b> goods beneficial to their taxable income. The need for HP is reduced when consumers have collateral {{or other forms of}} credit readily available.|$|R
500|$|The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (...) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{provided}} implied terms in contracts for {{the supply of}} goods and for <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements, and limited the use of exclusion clauses. The result of a joint report by the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, First Report on Exemption Clauses, the Act was granted the Royal Assent on 18 April 1973 and came into force a month later. It met with a mixed reaction from academics, who praised the additional protection it offered {{while at the same}} time questioning whether it was enough; several aspects of the Act's draftsmanship and implementation were also called into question. Much of the Act was repealed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the 1973 Act's provisions.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting {{that in some ways}} it was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear how}} this might be done. Turpin complimented the section on <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements, although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|E
500|$|After {{talking to}} Sutcliffe {{one night at}} the Casbah Coffee Club (owned by Pete Best's mother, Mona Best), Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner President 500/5 model bass guitar on <b>hire-purchase</b> from Frank Hessey's Music Shop. Sutcliffe was versed in music: he had sung in the local church choir in Huyton, his mother had insisted on piano lessons for him {{since the age of}} nine, he had played bugle in the Air Training Corps, and his father had taught him some chords on the guitar. In May 1960, Sutcliffe joined Lennon, McCartney, and George Harrison (then known as [...] "the Silver Beatles"). Sutcliffe's fingers would often blister during long rehearsals, as he had never practised long enough for his fingers to become calloused, even though he had {{previously}} played acoustic guitar. Sutcliffe started acting as a booking agent for the group, and they often used his Gambier Terrace flat as a rehearsal room.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kipling, [...] "We {{furnished}} {{it with a}} simplicity that fore-ran the <b>hire-purchase</b> system. We bought, {{second or}} third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar. We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch [...] tin pipes (why we were not burned in our beds each week of the winter I never can understand) and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hunter left The Apex Group in 1958, {{just before}} they {{recorded}} their first single [...] "Yorkshire Relish, Caravan" [...] for John Lever Records. Hunter played in a few local groups, but eventually his financial situation forced a change. [...] "I wasn't making my <b>hire-purchase</b> payments, and 'little jobs' were getting done and people were getting smacked. I was never {{in the middle of}} it, but I was always somewhere in the area." [...] He returned to Shrewsbury, ostensibly to become more responsible in his personal life, and settled down enough to have a steady girlfriend in Diane Coles. Outside of his day job, he and Tony Wardle formed a harmonica duo inspired by Morton Fraser's Harmonica Gang, a local variety act.|$|E
60|$|So Bert grew up, {{filled with}} ideals {{of speed and}} enterprise, and became, so far as he became anything, a kind of bicycle {{engineer}} of the let's-have-a-look-at-it and enamel chipping variety. Even a road-racer, geared to a hundred and twenty, failed to satisfy him, {{and for a time}} he pined in vain at twenty miles an hour along roads that were continually more dusty and more crowded with mechanical traffic. But at last his savings accumulated, and his chance came. The <b>hire-purchase</b> system bridged a financial gap, and one bright and memorable Sunday morning he wheeled his new possession through the shop into the road, got on to it with the advice and assistance of Grubb, and teuf-teuffed off into the haze of the traffic-tortured high road, to add himself as one more voluntary public danger to the amenities of the south of England.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{restrictions}} on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of <b>hire-purchase</b> developed. These were first regulated by the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932, which only covered Scotland; England and Wales was first covered by the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1938, later amended by the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1954 and the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1964. The 1965 Act applied to all <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.|$|E
50|$|The Advertisements (<b>Hire-Purchase)</b> Act 1957 (1957 c.41) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{regulated}} the way {{in which}} <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements could be advertised. One of the objectives of the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1938 had been {{to make sure that people}} entering into a <b>hire-purchase</b> agreement must be signed by the parties and must contain minimal financial information. This did not help, however, in situations where a party may have been misled by advertisements, and putting something in a document is not the same as ensuring somebody has read it before they signed it.|$|E

50|$|Part V {{contains}} several provisions {{relating to}} the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These {{are similar to those}} found in the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1965, but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the <b>hire-purchase</b> and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at common law; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The aim was {{to assist}} collectioners and {{operators}} in the purchase and sales of art works. Finarte became {{a pioneer in the}} provision of financial services and products including sales advances, loans using art as collateral, and <b>hire-purchase</b> financing.|$|E
50|$|The {{financial}} {{results of the}} first year of operation showed an operating profit of £954, making 19.7% of turnover. This was quite healthy, except that £857 8s 9d was due to Archer-Houblon as part of the agreed <b>hire-purchase</b> arrangement for rolling stock.|$|E
5000|$|The courts {{can also}} make [...] "time orders" [...] {{providing}} for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made {{at the discretion of}} the courts after an application for an enforcement order. The time orders can also cover statutory bailment in the case of hire-order or <b>hire-purchase</b> agreements. If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the <b>Hire-Purchase</b> Act 1965, which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.|$|E
50|$|Instruments were {{initially}} only those personally {{owned by the}} band's members, although extra instruments were later purchased using an educational <b>hire-purchase</b> scheme.

50|$|Kiska {{was born}} in Poprad. He studied {{electrical}} engineering. In 1990, after the Velvet Revolution, {{he moved to the}} United States.

50|$|In September 1973 the {{government}} issued {{a white paper}} titled Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit in which they indicated they were planning to implement {{almost all of the}} Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations.

5000|$|However {{they had}} become {{dissatisfied}} with their contractors and had started offering the jobs to current staff, with a set-up for <b>hire-purchase</b> for people to buy their own Leyland lorries (through a related company called [...] "Ready Mixed Finance Ltd"). Latimer took up this chance. He went into the <b>hire-purchase</b> to buy his own lorry, and was under a contract to haul concrete for the company. Latimer's contract described him as an [...] "independent contractor" [...] and he paid all the lorry running costs. But he had to put the company colours on his truck. He also had to wear a company uniform while he was working. He could only use the lorry for Ready Mixed purposes. His remuneration was calculated on mileage and load. The question about whether he was an [...] "employee" [...] or an independent contractor arose because the company was not paying national insurance contributions on his behalf under the National Insurance Act 1965. If he was self-employed they did not need to, {{but if he was}} an employee they did.|$|E
50|$|At {{a meeting}} of {{creditors}} on 29 January 1962 the company had a total deficiency of £521,073, {{the failure of the}} company was attributed by the directors to insufficient capital and too rapid expansion, loss of income from aircraft under repair, high wage costs and large <b>hire-purchase</b> payments were also cited. As the company's assets would just about cover the debts the company was handed over to the official receiver to liquidate.|$|E
50|$|SME finance is {{the funding}} of small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises, and represents a major function of the general business finance market - in which capital for different types of firms are supplied, acquired, and costed or priced.
