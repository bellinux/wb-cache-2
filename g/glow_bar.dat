40|$|Interest in {{accurate}} {{detection and}} targeting of aggressor missiles has received considerable interest {{with the national}} priority of developing a missile defense system. Understanding the thermal signatures of the exhaust plumes of such missiles is key to accomplishing that mission. Before signature models can be precisely developed for specific rockets, the radiation of the molecular or combustion species within those plumes must be accurately predicted. A combination translation / rotation scanning diagnostic technique has been developed to map the combustion species of a rocket plume and characterize its radiation properties. Using new infrared spectrometer and fiber optic cable technology to transmit the signal spectrum of interest, the custom designed mechanism can sweep through two dimensions of a steady-state rocket exhaust. A <b>glow</b> <b>bar,</b> or blackbody simulator, is shuttered {{on the opposite side}} of the plume, allowing the spectrometer to measure both the emission and absorption spectra. This thesis demonstrated the first time use of fiber optic cable to transmit infrared emission / absorption (E/A) spectra from a rocket plume to an infrared detector. This new fiber optic configuration allows for rapid translation and rotation around the rocket plume, establishing the capability for rapid spatial characterization of the combustion species present. Experimental results may then be compared to DoD rocket plume model predictions to highlight areas for improvement. US Air Force (USAF) autho...|$|E
5000|$|After Nernst lamps {{fell into}} {{obsolescence}} [...] "Nernst glowers" [...] {{went on to}} be used as the infrared-emitting source used in IR spectroscopy devices. (Recently, even this has become obsolete as Nernst glowers have been largely replaced for this purpose by silicon carbide <b>glow</b> <b>bars</b> or [...] "globars", which are conductive even at room temperature and therefore need no preheating.) ...|$|R
60|$|To {{bring him}} out and lay him on a bank {{was the work of}} an instant; a basin of cold water was dashed in his face, and he began to recover consciousness, but very slowly. He had been saved by a miracle. No sooner were his preservers out of the {{building}} than the window-frames lit up as if by magic with deep and waving fringes of flames. Simultaneously, the joints of the boards forming the front door started into view as <b>glowing</b> <b>bars</b> of fire: a star of red light penetrated the centre, gradually increasing in size till the flames rushed forth.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} term Globar is an English portmanteau word consisting of <b>glow</b> and <b>bar.</b> Hence, the term glowbar {{is often used}} synonymously in the English-speaking area (which is an incorrect spelling in the strict sense).|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} nine {{o'clock in the}} evening, and Gladwyne's {{somewhat}} noisy guests were scattered about his house and the terrace in front of it. Several of them had gathered in the hall, and Bella Crestwick, Lisle's companion on the moors, stood, cigarette in hand, with {{one foot on the}} old-fashioned hearth-irons, frankly discussing him. A few birch logs <b>glowed</b> behind the <b>bars,</b> for on those high uplands the autumn nights were chilly, but the wide door stood open, revealing a pale green band of light behind the black hills, and allowing the sweet, cool air of the moors to flow in.|$|R

5000|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} positive reviews from most music critics, {{based on an}} aggregate score of 72/100 from Metacritic. Stephen Thomas Erlewine editor from Allmusic rated it four-and-a-half-stars out of five, praising Twain for: [...] "been writing well crafted songs as universal anthems, so listeners can hear themselves within these tales." [...] Erlewine further commented that: [...] "The album had big, polished, multipurpose hooks and big, sweeping emotions. This is Super-Size pop, as outsized and grandiose as good pop should be", he concluded. Matthew Bjorke from About.com rated it four-stars out of five and said that: [...] "This 19 track opus is sure to please most fans of both pop and modern country." [...] The Blender review was also positive, saying that: [...] "Twain's songs are never deep, but they have hooks tattooed on their skin and harmonies that <b>glow</b> like <b>bar</b> lights." [...] Also with a positive review, Billboard said that: [...] "It's quintessential Shania, light as vapor, sweet as sugar, rendered with personality and undeniable charisma. Expect precious metal." [...] Andrew Lynch from Entertainment.ie rated it three-stars out of five and said that: [...] "The songs, themselves, meanwhile, are as bland and one-dimensional as {{they were on the}} smash hit Come on Over, sassily upbeat stuff with a dash of girl power thrown in for good measure. A high proportion of them, however, are also infuriatingly catchy - suggesting that Twain may well have another global success on her hands." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{upstairs in}} the drawing-room he became {{the victim of a}} restless fate, that would, on no account, permit him to sit down. She had sunk on a low easy-chair, and taking up from a small table at her elbow a fan with ivory leaves, shaded her face from the fire. The coals glowed without a flame; and upon the red <b>glow</b> the {{vertical}} <b>bars</b> of the grate stood out at her feet, black and curved, like the charred ribs of a consumed sacrifice. Far off, a lamp perched on a slim brass rod, burned under a wide shade of crimson silk: the centre, within the shadows of the large room, of a fiery twilight that had in the warm quality of its tint something delicate, refined and infernal. His soft footfalls and the subdued beat of the clock on the high mantel-piece answered each other regularly--as if time and himself, engaged in a measured contest, had been pacing together through the infernal delicacy of twilight towards a mysterious goal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{epilogue}} skips {{forward a}} number of years. It is told {{from the perspective of}} a newcomer from Zakalon, a distant kingdom to the east of Bekla. This man, Siristrou, is the leader of the first embassy from Zakalon sent to reciprocate the first visit of a Beklan to their country. The formerly lawless border town is now the home of hundreds of orphans and refugees working together to build a better future. Kelderek is its mayor, widely regarded as a fair and wise leader, and is married to his love, Melathys. Kelderek takes the traveller into his home and tells him of the bear Shardik, now known as a great animal who taught the people of the land the meaning of both kindness and hardship. In the final passages, Siristrou stirs the logs in the fireplace and plays a game of spotting images in the flames: an island, a <b>glowing</b> knife, a <b>barred</b> cage, an old woman, a deep ravine, a shaggy bear; he recognises these images in turn, and finally remarks [...] "That's a beautiful fire." ...|$|R
60|$|Every evening--as Peter {{had long}} absented {{himself from his}} former lounging-places at {{insurance}} offices, news-rooms, and book-stores, and as the honor of his company was seldom requested in private circles--he and Tabitha used to sit down sociably by the kitchen hearth. This was always heaped plentifully with the rubbish of his day's labor. As {{the foundation of the}} fire there would be a goodly-sized back-log of red oak, which after being sheltered from rain or damp above a century still hissed with the heat and distilled streams of water from each end, as if the tree had been cut down within a week or two. Next there were large sticks, sound, black and heavy, which had lost the principle of decay and were indestructible except by fire, wherein they <b>glowed</b> like red-hot <b>bars</b> of iron. On this solid basis Tabitha would rear a lighter structure, composed of the splinters of door-panels, ornamented mouldings, and such quick combustibles, which caught like straw and threw a brilliant blaze high up the spacious flue, making its sooty sides visible almost to the chimney-top. Meantime, the gloom of the old kitchen would be chased out of the cobwebbed corners and away from the dusky cross-beams overhead, and driven nobody could tell whither, while Peter smiled like a gladsome man and Tabitha seemed a picture of comfortable age. All this, of course, was but an emblem of the bright fortune which the destruction of the house would shed upon its occupants.|$|R
