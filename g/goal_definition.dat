A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{is often used to}} measure whether, and to what extent, a remanufactured product is ‘better’ for the environment than a newly produced equivalent.

The review suggests that the <b>goal</b> and scope <b>definitions</b> are often shrouded in obscurity in prior LCAs for remanufactured products.

Specifically, those variables {{of the strategic}} plan which impact on {{the success or failure}} of MIS are identified, and propositions are formulated relating states of the variables to system conditions. The variables concerned are the system development strategy, the purpose of MIS, the priority scheme, functions assigned the system, <b>goals,</b> <b>definitions</b> of requirements and documentation of the strategic plan. Two factors predominate in determining the appropriateness of strategic plans for MIS explicitness (the degree to which the process is conscious, formal and documented) and situational fit (the degree to which the MIS is compatible with the specific organization and its members).
