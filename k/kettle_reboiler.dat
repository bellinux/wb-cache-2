40|$|An {{effective}} {{design for a}} <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> is dependent on fitness for purpose while reducing costs. Thus, accurate information concerning two-phase flow behaviour within it is important. Experimental and numerical studies {{have been carried out}} in this research to gain a more detailed understanding of the phenomena associated with two-phase flow in a thin-slice <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler.</b> The <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> contained 241 electrically heated tubes arranged as 17 rows of 17 columns in an in-line layout with an outside diameter of 19 mm and a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 34. The working fluids used in this investigation were pentane and the refrigerant R 113. They were boiled at atmospheric pressure at uniform heat fluxes in the range of 10 to 40 kW/m 2. The patterns of flow inside the <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> were investigated experimentally using ordinary and high speed cameras. Visual observation of the flow patterns showed that the flow in the tube bundle was two-dimensional at heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above. The quantity of foam and recirculation above the tube bundle were found to depend on both the heat flux and the working fluid used. Observations of the two-phase flow pattern in the shell indicated that the movement of fluid from the centre column of the bundle was affected by the down flow into the top of the tube bundle. Two flow patterns in the tube bundle were identified: bubbly and intermittent. At low heat fluxes, bubbly flow dominated, then, with increasing heat flux, bubble coalescence {{led to the development of}} vapour slugs and intermittent flow was observed. Pressure drop measurements were made in three columns within the tube bundle. The results showed that at heat fluxes below 20 kW/m 2, the pressure drop remained nearly constant and equal to the all-liquid value. At a heat flux of 20 kW/m 2 and above, the pressure drop was found to increasingly fall below the all-liquid value as the bundle row number increased. This effect was especially evident in the centre of the bundle. A change in the flow pattern caused the pressure distribution up the tube bundle to change from roughly constant to decaying with height. Based on a number of assumptions, the two-fluid model has been applied. The two-fluid model’s drag coefficient and tube resistance were deduced from a one-dimensional model. The two-fluid model predictions show good agreement with the experimental results for the pressure distribution and flow distribution. Grid sizes of 10, 8 and 4 mm for the bundle and the pool were considered. It was found that the predicted bundle results were not affected by changing the grid size. However, in the pool region, a small grid size was needed. A grid size of 10 mm was used in the bundle while 4 mm was used in the pool. The pool velocity predictions compared well with measured values available in the open literature. The results indicated that the bundle flow is not significantly affected by the pool flow. This allows the two-fluid model to be further refined: simplifying it and reducing the computational time. A bundle-only two fluid model has been developed to accurately predict two-phase flow behaviour in the <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> tube bundle. Information available from earlier studies has been used to develop this model because of the difficulties associated with measuring the void fraction and velocities within the tube bundle. The model uses two different boundary conditions: (1) static liquid pressure in the pool and (2) variation of pressure in the pool based on the flow pattern transition. The results predicted by the model have been compared with experimental data and with one and two-fluid models at different heat fluxes. Boundary condition (1) was found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the one and two-fluid models at a heat flux of 10 kW/m 2. This was because the transition flow pattern was not achieved and the bundle was surrounded by a static pool. Boundary condition (2) is based on the Kutateladze number (Ku), which sets the transition point from bubbly to intermittent flow at a certain height in the bundle. For Ku ≤ 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by liquid, and if Ku > 1. 09, the bundle flow would be surrounded by two-phase flow. At heat fluxes of 20 kW/m 2 and above, boundary condition (2) has been found to be in good agreement with experimental data and the values predicted from the one and two-fluid models for liquid velocities, vertical mass flux and void fraction. The bundle-only model accurately predicts the trend line of constant and decaying pressure drop measured at low and high heat fluxes, respectively, and the observed flow phenomena in the <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler.</b> The key feature of the model presented is that it allows two-phase flow in the <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> to be simulated by only modelling the tube bundle. Thus the model is simplified and less computational time is required. A central column model was developed using the minimum pressure gradient approach. The predicted results from this model were compared with experimental data and the values predicted by the two-fluid model and the bundle-only model. Reasonable agreement was obtained indicating that the flow distribution may be linked to the minimum pressure gradient...|$|E
50|$|Thermosyphon {{reboilers}} (Image 2) do {{not require}} pumping of the column bottoms liquid into the reboiler. Natural circulation is obtained by using the density difference between the reboiler inlet column bottoms liquid and the reboiler outlet liquid-vapor mixture to provide sufficient liquid head to deliver the tower bottoms into the reboiler. Thermosyphon reboilers (also known as calandrias) are more complex than <b>kettle</b> <b>reboilers</b> and require more attention from the plant operators. There are many types of thermosyphon reboilers including vertical, horizontal, once-through or recirculating.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kettle</b> <b>reboilers</b> (Image 1) {{are very}} simple and reliable. They may require pumping {{of the column}} bottoms liquid into the kettle, or there may be {{sufficient}} liquid head to deliver the liquid into the reboiler. In this reboiler type, steam flows through the tube bundle and exits as condensate. The liquid {{from the bottom of}} the tower, commonly called the bottoms, flows through the shell side. There is a retaining wall or overflow weir separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|R
40|$|Cross-flow boiling on tube/tube-bundles {{commonly}} found in horizontal steam generators, <b>kettle</b> <b>reboilers,</b> etc. presents substantial complexity due to the local two-phase flow structures {{in the presence of}} phase-change heat transfer, but a modelling capability would be of considerable practical use. To use component-scale ensemble-averaged Eulerian-Eulerian CFD multiple additional closure models are required to define the interactions between bubble-liquid and bubble–bubble interfaces, and the choice of these models inevitably affects the predictions. This thesis reports investigations into these closure models, focusing mainly on the interfacial forces for modeling two-phase adiabatic and subcooled boiling flows, and the effects that they have upon the predictions of the flow, with the objective of attempting to identify so far as possible a "best combination". Detailed CFD investigations on adiabatic and boiling upward two-phase flows in a simple vertical pipe geometry, using the ensemble average Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid framework of the commercial CFD code STAR-CCM+, with various interfacial force models, are reported. This is done for both adiabatic and subcooled boiling flows. One of the main findings of these studies was the model inadequacies associated with the non-drag interfacial forces that are primarily responsible for the lateral void distributions. Among the interfacial force models investigated for adiabatic cases, the use of the Ishii and Zuber (1979) drag coefficient, the Behzadi et al. (2004) lift coefficient and the Antal et al. (1991) wall lubrication force model combination gives the best predictions for all the primitive variables considered. However, the need for a more appropriate model for the lift force coefficient, along with a matched/paired model for the wall lift/lubrication force, is identified. For the subcooled boiling investigation, a negative lift coefficient (- 0. 1) in conjunction with the default turbulent dispersion and wall lubrication force models predicted a reasonably accurate axial void distribution, as well as an acceptable velocity profile for both phases, and this is identified as the “best combination”. In addition, many other shortcomings regarding the closures related to the two-fluid framework have been identified and are discussed. Finally, the ‘best combination’ of models has been used successfully to simulate the boiling heat transfer on a single tube under cross-flow, which is a novel application of the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach in conjunction with the WHFP approach on such flow geometry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the two-phase flow in a <b>kettle</b> <b>reboiler</b> in order to improve the design methods used for them. An air-water in-line tube bundle was designed and constructed with tubes 38 mm in outside diameter on a pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 32 to provide two phase pressure drop data. These data and other data from the literature were used to investigate the two-fluid model proposed by Simovic et al. [1] and the conventional 1 -D design model, implemented with three separate void fraction correlations and one two-phase friction multiplier correlation. The results showed that the two-fluid model predicted air-water void fraction data well but R 113 data poorly, with pressure drop predictions for both being unsatisfactory. The one-dimensional model was shown to predict pressure-drop and void fraction data reasonably well, provided the Feenstra et al. [2] correlation for void fraction and the Ishihara et al. [3] correlation for two-phase friction multiplier were used. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
