25|$|That Anthony had {{remained}} unmarried {{gave her an}} important business advantage in this work. A married woman at that time had {{the legal status of}} feme covert, which, among other things, excluded her from signing contracts (her husband could <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> her, if he chose). As Anthony had no husband, she was a feme sole and could freely sign contracts for convention halls, printed materials, etc.|$|E

25|$|England {{came out}} to the evening session hoping to bat through losing one wicket maximum. Just a few overs in, Collingwood edged one through to the keeper, out for 5 off 36 balls. After that {{partnership}} in which 15 runs were scored for 75 balls, England had to bat more aggressively and Pietersen seemed the perfect man to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the team. Cook started looking much more confident against Warne and soon he was one run away from his maiden Ashes century, not made easy by Warne but eventually, Cook got the run to bring up a 257-ball 100. The day had belonged firmly to England, but with just 3 overs left, McGrath took the wicket of Cook, edging behind to Gilchrist, and bowled nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard for a second-ball duck. McGrath proceeded to beat Flintoff with the remaining two balls, including an unsuccessful appeal for caught-behind. Flintoff and Pietersen, saw out the remaining overs, leaving England on 265 for 5.|$|E
500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{influenced}} {{a number}} of prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of The Matrix and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver, saying, [...] "We wanna <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> real." [...] The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which {{was inspired by the}} opening credits of Ghost in the Shell, and the way people accessed the Matrix through holes {{in the back of their}} necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates.|$|E

Bonnie has the life Jules wishes she has." [...] Aniston had previously worked with Courteney Cox in the American sitcom Friends, and again on the serial drama Dirt.

500|$|On 20 September 2007, Constantine and Woodall {{launched}} their own exclusive Littlewoods women's clothing range {{which consists of}} trousers, coats and tops which like their underwear range, are designed to make certain areas appear slimmer. A series of eight dresses, cashmere knitwear, faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range. She commented [...] "If you {{want to create a}} waist, there's a dress that's going to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> you too. We've designed it very much around the female body."

One pseudonymous writer citing unnamed sources said Lively was among five leading contenders that included Eva Green, Keri Russell, Diane Kruger and Jennifer Garner. About her stunt work in which she rehearsed with stunt coordinator Gary Powell (Casino Royale, The Bourne Ultimatum, Quantum of Solace), gymnastic acrobats from Cirque du Soleil and used aerial stunt rigs created for The Matrix, Lively explained, [...] "Our director likes it real—the fights close and dirty... I'm 40 feet in the air, spiraling around. That's the best workout you can ever do because it's all core... You <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> ten minutes and you should see your body the next day!

500|$|In May 1995 the company's {{financial}} {{numbers for}} its transitional 1994–1995 period {{with its new}} artistic director were reported to be a deficit of $240,000.

Huddle {{had been on the}} 1991 search committee for the OSF's artistic director Henry Woronicz, but he suddenly announced his resignation in June 1995 effective the following October citing [...] "personal reasons". Huddle {{and the rest of the}} theater community were surprised by Woronicz's resignation. In 2000 PCS board president Julie Vigeland commented to The Seattle Times that after separating from OSF [...] "it was a real challenge to form our own identity", but that Huddle [...] "did a wonderful job helping us <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the last six years".|$|E

500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, but there is something about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E
500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast from RHOBH {{featured}} included Lisa Vanderpump, Yolanda Foster, Carlton Gebbia, Kyle Richards, and Kim Richards, {{who acted}} as instrument {{players in the}} video. Kyle Richards and Vanderpump also accompany Gaga on a different sequence in the video, showing the trio taking revenge against a corporation. Vanderpump explained that they were contacted by Andy Cohen—who himself has a cameo appearance in [...] "G.U.Y."—from Bravo and were signed for side-roles in the video. Richards noticed that Gaga was a perfectionist on the set, with Vanderpump saying that the singer took charge of {{every detail of the}} production. They explained to The Hollywood Reporter that Gaga wanted the housewives to [...] "feel and look beautiful and fierce" [...] and during one of the homicide scenes she explained: [...] "I want you to whip that ponytail even more. Go back and really exaggerate your head-flipping'. I was like, 'Whatever you say'. [...] To get me into a lace bodysuit, there's not many people I'd <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for.</b> I'm 53 years old, for God's sake. She said, 'This is what you're wearing'."

500|$|... "Sing" [...] features" [...] primary vocals by Lennox and American singer Madonna; {{the latter}} sings solo {{on the second}} verse. Apart from them, the line-up {{consists}} of: Anastacia, Isobel Campbell, Dido, Céline Dion, Melissa Etheridge, Fergie, Beth Gibbons, Faith Hill, Angélique Kidjo, Beverley Knight, Gladys Knight, k.d. lang, Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Pink, Bonnie Raitt, Shakira, Shingai Shoniwa, Joss Stone, Sugababes, KT Tunstall and, Martha Wainwright. Since accommodating all the singers would have posed a scheduling challenge, Lennox asked them to contribute vocals on the chorus of the song. When she received the recorded vocals from Madonna, Lennox found that Madonna had not only sung during the chorus, but also contributed by singing the second verse. She [...] "was really touched – for Madonna is very rigorous in what she gets involved in and for her to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me, I was thrilled to bits". Lennox also admitted that featuring Madonna would bring a bigger audience for the song, thereby helping the cause. The refrain consists of an [...] "empowering message" [...] with the group of singers belting the line [...] "Sing my sister Sing! / Let your voice be heard" [...] while interpolating [...] "Jikelele" [...] in between. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "Sing" [...] consists of a piano played in the background reminiscent of Marvin Gaye's 1968 single, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine".|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, {{while in}} St. Louis for his ninth All-Star appearance, Ichiro made {{a trip to}} Sisler's grave. He later told reporters, [...] "There's not many chances to come to St. Louis.

I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a grand upperclassman of the {{baseball}} world. I think it's only natural for someone to want to do that, to express my feelings in that way.

2500|$|Since the {{break-up}} of Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler has shown {{no interest in}} reforming the band and {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again," [...] and telling reporters that [...] "I would only <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a charity. I'm glad I've experienced it all – I {{had a lot of fun}} with it – but I like things the way they are." [...] However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, and Danny Cummings has frequently contributed, notably to three of Knopfler's most recent solo album releases All the Roadrunning (with Emmylou Harris), Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky.|$|E
