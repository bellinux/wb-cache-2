5|$|A 2007 {{field study}} that used {{molecular}} techniques to survey aquatic <b>fungal</b> taxa {{in a small}} springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many <b>fungal</b> taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, which suggests that a closely related species may also be common in streams.|$|E
5|$|A <b>fungal</b> {{infection}} {{explains the}} symptoms observed in AD patients. The slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic <b>fungal</b> infections, {{which can be}} asymptomatic and thus, unnoticed and untreated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fungal</b> {{infection}} of AD brain {{has also been}} described.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} some {{plant and animal}} species, more than 70 <b>fungal</b> species display bioluminescence.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to plants and animals, the early fossil {{record of the}} fungi is meager. Factors that likely contribute to the under-representation of <b>fungal</b> species among fossils include the nature of <b>fungal</b> fruiting bodies, which are soft, fleshy, and easily degradable tissues and the microscopic dimensions of most <b>fungal</b> structures, which therefore are not readily evident. <b>Fungal</b> fossils are difficult to distinguish from those of other microbes, and are most easily identified when they resemble extant fungi. Often recovered from a permineralized plant or animal host, these samples are typically studied by making thin-section preparations that can be examined with light microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Researchers study compression fossils by dissolving the surrounding matrix with acid and then using light or scanning electron microscopy to examine surface details.|$|E
5|$|Infection by the <b>fungal</b> species Anthracostroma persooniae and Camarosporula persooniae {{results in}} leaf spot disease.|$|E
5|$|Research into <b>fungal</b> prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. <b>Fungal</b> prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though <b>fungal</b> prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic <b>fungal</b> prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} the Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event (251.4Ma), a <b>fungal</b> spike (originally thought to be an extraordinary abundance of <b>fungal</b> spores in sediments) formed, suggesting that fungi were the dominant life form at this time, representing nearly 100% of the available fossil record for this period. However, the relative proportion of <b>fungal</b> spores relative to spores formed by algal species is difficult to assess, the spike did not appear worldwide, and in many places it did not fall on the Permian–Triassic boundary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fungal</b> {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, <b>fungal</b> cell walls do not contain cellulose.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fungal</b> species Marasmius oreades and Hypholoma capnoides can bioconvert {{titanium}} in titanium polluted soils.|$|E
5|$|A single <b>fungal</b> serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the <b>fungal</b> cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|After the war finished, Rogerson {{continued}} studying <b>fungal</b> systematics {{and started}} a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor {{for the last few}} months of his doctoral program. Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on <b>fungal</b> taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the <b>fungal</b> flora of air), and plant diseases caused by fungi.|$|E
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of <b>fungal</b> cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in <b>fungal</b> evolution.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne <b>fungal</b> diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the <b>fungal</b> cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a <b>fungal</b> pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{contains}} a unique sterol molecule called volemolide, a derivative {{of the common}} <b>fungal</b> sterol ergosterol that may have application in <b>fungal</b> chemotaxonomy. A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols, three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly oxygenated compounds—similar to sterols found in marine soft coral and sponges—are rare in fungi. The mushroom also contains volemitol (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from the species by the French scientist Émile Bourquelot in 1889. Volemitol occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Bisporella sulfurina have a {{coloration}} similar to B.citrina, {{but they are}} smaller and grow in clusters on old, blackened, <b>fungal</b> stroma on wood.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{revealed}} that <b>fungal</b> infection {{is present in}} different brain regions of AD patients, {{but not in the}} control individuals.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2012, Davis was {{diagnosed}} with valley fever, a rare dust-borne <b>fungal</b> infection endemic in the American southwest.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} applied to microfossils of Devonian age with <b>fungal</b> affinities, though these taxa have since been {{recognized}} as an early growth form of Tortotubus.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species have}} {{developed}} specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most <b>fungal</b> phyla, and arbuscules of several mycorrhizal fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Mycena haematopus can be parasitized by Spinellus fusiger, another <b>fungal</b> species {{which gives}} the {{mushroom}} a strikingly hairy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of <b>fungal</b> bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry <b>fungal</b> spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the <b>fungal</b> translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>fungal</b> {{diseases}} infect {{and kill}} adult cicadas while another entomopathogenic fungus, Cordyceps spp., attacks nymphs. Massospora cicadina specifically attacks the adults of periodical cicadas, the spores remaining dormant {{in the soil}} between outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} <b>fungal</b> tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the <b>fungal</b> mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing <b>fungal</b> oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The USDA is also {{assessing}} {{the application of}} Beauveria bassiana, an insect <b>fungal</b> pathogen, for controlling emerald ash borer in conjunction with parasitoid wasps.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} <b>fungal</b> prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable prion domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the prion domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known prion. Similarly, removing the prion domain from a <b>fungal</b> prion protein inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of prion behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar prion domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These <b>fungal</b> prion domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues, with an asparagine bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E
5|$|The nucleariids, protists {{currently}} grouped in the Choanozoa (Opisthokonta), may be {{the next}} sister group to the eumycete clade, and as such could be included in an expanded <b>fungal</b> kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Epacris impressa are colonized by fungi forming ericoid mycorrhiza. It is {{believed}} that the <b>fungal</b> species vary between regions.|$|E
5|$|There is no unique {{generally}} accepted {{system at the}} higher taxonomic levels and there are frequent name changes at every level, from species upwards. Efforts among researchers are now underway to establish and encourage usage of a unified and more consistent nomenclature. <b>Fungal</b> species can also have multiple scientific names depending on their life cycle and mode (sexual or asexual) of reproduction. Web sites such as Index Fungorum and ITIS list current names of <b>fungal</b> species (with cross-references to older synonyms).|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or <b>fungal</b> infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the <b>fungal</b> pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the <b>fungal</b> disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most <b>fungal</b> tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common <b>fungal</b> pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. <b>Fungal</b> peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first <b>fungal</b> peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{secondary}} metabolites {{discovered in}} H.eburneus include the ceramide compound named hygrophamide ((2S,3R,4R,2’R)-2-(2’-hydroxy-9’Z-ene-tetracosanoylamino)-octadecane-1,3,4-triol), and the β-carboline alkaloids known as harmane and norharmane. The report of {{discovery of the}} latter two compounds in 2008 represents their first known occurrence in <b>fungal</b> fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{and related}} species of macrofungi {{accumulate}} vanadium (up to 500mg/kg in dry weight). Vanadium {{is present in}} the coordination complex amavadin in <b>fungal</b> fruit-bodies. The biological importance of the accumulation is unknown. Toxic or peroxidase enzyme functions have been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbits are {{susceptible}} to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, <b>fungal,</b> and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the growing}} season, the mean July {{temperature}} is 18°C (66°F). The average annual rainfall is 630mm (25inches), with 45mm (1.8inches) falling during the harvest month of September. Throughout the year, growers must {{be mindful of}} the hazards of <b>fungal</b> disease and early spring frost.|$|E
