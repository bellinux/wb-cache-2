40|$|Aim: Indigenous Australians {{have much}} higher {{mortality}} than non-Indigenous Australians. We aimed {{to quantify the}} excess of <b>deaths</b> <b>with</b> a renal causal assignment among Indigenous people aged 25 years and over in Queensland, Australia, 1997 - 2000 and their distribution by remoteness. Methods: Both underlying and associated causes defined by ICD, 10 (th) edition, were examined. Mortality rates were standardized to the concurrent non-Indigenous population. Results: In Indigenous people, standardized mortality ratios with a renal assignment of death by remoteness of residence were 194 % (Major City and Inner Regional), 439 % (Outer Regional and Remote) and 782 % (Very Remote). Of all these <b>deaths</b> <b>with</b> a renal assignment, only 18 % had a renal assignment as the underlying cause. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease were frequent concomitant causes in <b>deaths</b> <b>with</b> a renal assignment. Conclusion: The Indigenous population in Queensland has elevated rates of renal <b>deaths</b> compared <b>with</b> the non-Indigenous population. This disparity increases markedly with increasing remoteness of residence. Reliance on underlying causes of death alone greatly underestimates the association of renal disease <b>with</b> <b>deaths</b> in this population...|$|R
