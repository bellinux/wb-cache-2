5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5|$|Webber took {{victory in}} just his fourth ever F3 race, at Brands Hatch, leading <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> and setting a new lap {{record in the}} process.

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the line, 17 trains per weekday ran in each {{direction}} at intervals of one hour from around 7am to around 11pm. The initial trains were drawn by Metropolitan Railway A and B Class locomotives. Most trains stopped at all stations, but a fast trains each morning ran between Chesham and Baker Street, taking 50 minutes <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> On Sundays, trains again ran at hourly intervals, but only 12 trains per day ran and there was a three-hour gap in services in the morning to allow the railway's staff to attend church.|$|E
5|$|For sprinting events (bar the 4 × 400m relay and {{the indoor}} 400metres), each athlete must run the race within their {{allocated}} lane <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> If an athlete leaves their lane or {{steps on the}} line demarking each lane the athlete will be disqualified. Lane rules also apply for initial periods of other track races, for example, {{the beginning of the}} 800m. Similar rules apply for longer distance races when a large field of athletes is present and separate starting points are designated, with the field merging into one group shortly after the starting phase.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} of Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on. As with most survival horror video games, ammunition is limited {{and must be}} conserved carefully for situations when it will really be indispensable, occasionally requiring the player to avoid combat even when armed. The game {{as a whole is}} heavily scripted and very linear, with only one path through the chapters <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish,</b> in contrast with some earlier survival horror games such as the original Alone in the Dark (which itself was inspired by the Mythos).|$|E
5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the Star Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script. Shatner {{was pleased with the}} results, especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish,</b> {{in which the}} product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time. Countless {{people in the streets}} of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish.</b> Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Rockets 51–14 at home before {{a crowd of}} 60,457, the fourth time during the season that {{attendance}} at Cleveland Stadium surpassed 60,000 people. The Browns led <b>from</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>finish,</b> and Lavelli and Speedie had two touchdown receptions each. Graham's four touchdown passes helped the Browns reach an AAFC scoring record. Bud Schwenk made his first appearance {{in the fourth quarter}} of the game, substituting for Graham as the game turned into a blowout. He threw for a fifth touchdown, a 20-yard pass to Bill Lund. Edgar Jones added to Cleveland's scoring with a touchdown run in the first quarter, and center Frank Gatski scored the team's final touchdown in the fourth quarter after intercepting a pass and running it back 36 yards. It was the only touchdown of Gatski's 12-year career. Groza made a 51-yard field goal, the longest of the year in either the National Football League or AAFC, and kicked through six of the team's seven extra points. The seventh extra point was blocked, only the second time he missed a conversion in 33 tries. The Rockets managed two touchdowns, the first by Elroy Hirsch on an 81-yard drive in the second quarter and the second on a 76-yard punt return in the third quarter.|$|E

40|$|In online social networking, network {{monitoring}} and financial applications, {{there is a}} need to query high rate streams of XML data, but methods for executing individual XPath queries on streaming XML data have not kept pace with multicore CPUs. For data-parallel processing, a single XML stream is typically split into well-formed fragments, which are then processed independently. Such an approach, however, introduces a sequential bottleneck and suffers from low cache locality, limiting its scalability across CPU cores. We describe a data-parallel approach for the processing of streaming XPath queries based on pushdown transducers. Our approach permits XML data to be split into arbitrarilysized chunks, with each chunk processed by a parallel automaton instance. Since chunks may be malformed, our automata consider all possible starting states for XML elements and build mappings <b>from</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>finishing</b> states. These mappings can be constructed independently for each chunk by different CPU cores. For streaming queries from the XPathMark benchmark, we show a processing throughput of 2. 5 GB/s, with near linear scaling up to 64 CPU cores. 1...|$|R
