40|$|ABSTRACT: Important in {{biotechnology}} is {{the establishment}} of cell culture methods that reflect the in vivo situation accurately. One approach for reaching this goal is through 3 D cell cultivation that mimics tissue or organ structures and functions. We present here a newly designed and constructed random positioning incubator (RPI) that enables 3 D cell culture in simulated microgravity (0 g). In addition to growing cells in a weightlessness-like environment, our RPI enables long-duration cell cultivation under various gravita-tional loads, ranging from close to 0 g to almost 1 g. This allows {{the study of the}} mechanotransductional process of cells involved in the conversion of physical forces to an appropriate biochemical response. Gravity is a type of physical force with profound developmental implications in cellular systems as it modulates the resulting signaling cascades as a consequence of mechanical loading. The experiments presented here were conducted on mouse skeletal myoblasts and <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> two <b>types</b> of cells that have been shown in the past to be particularly sensitive to changes in gravity.

40|$|Apoptosis (the {{classical}} type of programmed cell death) can {{be triggered}} in many cell types by widely diverse stimuli. gamma rays, at low doses, can induce apoptosis in vitro in interphase <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In this <b>type</b> of apoptosis induction, activated gene expression {{is necessary for}} the fulfillment of the death program. In this report, we present evidence for a relationship between ubiquitin gene expression or ubiquitination and gamma-irradiation-mediated apoptosis in normal circulating <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Using in vitro nuclear transcription assays (run-on), Northern (RNA) blot analysis, immunolocalization studies, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis after immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that (i) the ubiquitin mRNA level is increased {{as a consequence of the}} activation of ubiquitin gene transcription 15 to 90 min after initiation of apoptosis; (ii) specifically in apoptotic cells, and not in all irradiated cells, nuclear proteins are highly ubiquitinated; and (iii) ubiquitin sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotide inhibition results in a decreased level of ubiquitinated nuclear proteins and considerably diminishes the proportion of cells exhibiting the apoptotic death pattern. Each of these results might be explained by different modifications occurring in irradiated cells. Their convergence strongly suggests that the ubiquitin gene is one of the genes with induced activity in the apoptotic death program and that ubiquitination of nuclear proteins might be involved in chromatin disorganization and oligonucleosomal fragmentation, which are among the key events occurring in apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is {{an acute}} immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy {{which can cause}} acute quadriplegia. Infection with micro-organisms, including Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), Haemophilus influenzae, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV), is recognized as a main triggering event for the disease. Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) genes {{are responsible for the}} formation of human ganglioside-like LOS structures in infectious micro-organisms that can induce GBS. Molecular mimicry of LOSs on the surface of infectious agents and of ganglioside antigens on neural cells is thought to induce cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses. Patients with GBS develop antibodies against those gangliosides, resulting in autoimmune targeting of peripheral nerve sites, leading to neural damage. Heterogeneity of ganglioside expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) may underlie the differential clinical manifestation of the GBS variants. Recent studies demonstrate that some GBS sera react with ganglioside complexes consisting of two different gangliosides, such as GD 1 a and GD 1 b, or GM 1 and GD 1 a, but not with each constituent ganglioside alone. The discovery of antiganglioside complex antibodies not only improves the detection rate of autoantibodies in GBS, but also provides a new concept in the antibody–antigen interaction through clustered carbohydrate epitopes. Although ganglioside mimicry is one of the possible etiological causes of GBS, unidentified factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis of GBS.

40|$|Earlier {{studies using}} the {{technique}} of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) have shown that in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> exchange <b>type</b> of aberrations are formed immediately following low doses (< 2 Gy) of X-rays, whereas at higher doses these aberrations increase with the duration of recovery. This reflects the relative roles of slow and fast repair {{in the formation of}} exchange aberrations. The underlying basis for slow and fast repairing components of the DNA repair may be related to differential localization of the initial damage in the genome, i. e., between relaxed and condensed chromatin. We have tried to gain some insight into this problem by (a) X-irradiating lymphocytes in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) a potent scavenger of radiation-induced. OH radicals followed by PCC and (b) probing the damage and repair in two specific chromosomes, 18 and 19, which are relatively poor and rich in transcribing genes by COMET-FISH, a combination of Comet assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques.

Splenic T cells derived from the transgenic mice were more resistant to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas mAb {{than those of the}} nontransgenic mice, whereas no appreciable difference in apoptosis was detected for thymocytes from either mouse’s type. The resistance of transgenic T cells may be due to Tax coded in the pX region, since Tax mediates the inhibition of anti-Fas– induced apoptosis in mature T cell line, Jurkat. Among the transgenic mice, the extent of the resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis was further enhanced in transgenic T cells with disease. These results suggest that the escape of self-reactive T cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis in the periphery, is critical for the development of autoimmune arthropathy in HTLV-I transgenic mice.

The spleens of these mice were then removed, and their lymphocytes were fused to a mouse myeloma cell line, FO cells. After screening over 1, 200 resulting hybrids, one stable hybrid was obtained that produced IgG 1 antibodies directed towards the insulin receptor. This antibody blocked 125 I-labeled insulin binding to its receptor by more than 90 % in three human tissues: IM- 9 cultured lymphocytes, freshly isolated adipocytes, and placenta membranes. In contrast, the antibody did not inhibit insulin binding to rat adipocytes and rat liver plasma membranes, suggesting that the antibody was species specific. In IM- 9 cells, which had their proteins prelabeled with [35 S]methionine, the antibody precipitated two polypeptides with molecular weights of 135, 000 and 95, 000; these molecular weights are identical to those previously identified as the alpha and beta subunits of the insulin receptor. The monoclonal antibody inhibited the actions of insulin on both human adipocytes and fibroblasts, suggesting that the antibody was an antagonist of insulin action.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of adult coeliac disease in The Netherlands was {{studied in the}} Dutch Coeliac Disease Society and in blood donors {{but not in the}} general population. We therefore studied the {{prevalence of}} recognized and unrecognized coeliac disease in a large cohort, representative of the adult Dutch general population. Blood samples were available for anonymous research, as well as data on dietary habits, self-reported physical characteristics, health problems, quality of life and socio-economic circumstances. METHODS: Subjects included 50, 760 individuals who had previously participated in two large population-based studies on health status in relation to lifestyle factors. Recognized coeliac disease was studied in all subjects by identification of self-reported adherence to a gluten-free diet and subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis of coeliac disease. Unrecognized coeliac disease was studied in a random sample of 1440 out of the 50, 760 subjects through serologic screening and <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> antigen (HLA) <b>typing.</b> RESULTS: The prevalence of recognized coeliac disease was 0. 016 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 008 - 0. 031) and of unrecognized coeliac disease 0. 35 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 15 - 0. 81). Menarcheal age was higher in women with recognized coeliac disease than in women without coeliac disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of adult recognized coeliac disease in The Netherlands is one of the lowest in Europe, while the prevalence of unrecognized coeliac disease is comparable with that in other European countries.

Pi2 is shown to fasten the recovery of Kv1.3 channels from inactivation whereas Pi3 has no such effect. The inability of Pi3 to enhance the recovery of channels in <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{is thought to be}} due to the amino acid substitution Glu7 to Pro7, but the exact mechanism is unknown.|$|R

Human {{pluripotent stem cells}} {{have the potential to}} produce essentially unlimited numbers of mature and functional blood lineage populations to study human hematopoiesis. Particularly, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have the advantage to provide a source of autologous transplantable blood cell populations suitable for treatment of patient specific hematological diseases. This research aims to derive <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from hiPSCs. There are three projects: The overall generation of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (B cell, T cell and NK cell) from hiPSCs is explored in Project I. In Project II and III, based on the derivation of NK cells, two human immunodeficiency disease models, both caused by specific somatic gene mutation, are established using human pluripotent stem cells. The ultimate goal of this research is to use hiPSCs to study the normal development of <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in vitro, as well as model human immunodeficiency diseases by combining with gene therapy methods, thus providing a novel approach for immunotherapy. The hypothesis is that <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> can be derived from hiPSCs and this will enable the establishment of in vitro models to study human immunodeficiency diseases. Specific aims: 1. To generate <b>human</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from hiPSCs in vitro; 2. To establish two human immunodeficiency disease models (X-SCID and WAS) through in vitro derivation of lymphocytes from hESCs/hiPSCs...|$|R
