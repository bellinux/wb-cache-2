5|$|The {{people of}} Navenby enjoy a high {{employment}} rate, although most {{work outside the}} village. Almost 600 commute each day, with the average <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> being 12.5miles (20.18km). The 2001 census revealed that of 1,186people questioned aged 16–74, 722 were economically active, with men working an average of 44.8hours each week and women an average of 31.2. The service industry was the largest sector of the local economy, employing 67% of all workers, compared to 1841 when 48% worked in agriculture. Manufacturing work {{was carried out by}} 178people in 2001 and 565 were in the service industries. Of these workers, 371 were classed as managerial and professional. In 1841, just 16.6% of male workers had middle class jobs, but the 2001 census showed this figure had increased to 47.9%.|$|E

25|$|In 1916,Cliff {{made the}} rather unusual {{decision}} {{to move to the}} factory of A.J. Wilkinson at Newport, Burslem, to improve her career opportunities. This necessitated a lengthy <b>journey</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> This was an unusual start to an unusual career; most young women in the Staffordshire Potteries were on 'apprentice wages', and having mastered a particular task, stayed with that to maximise their income. However, Cliff was ambitious and acquired skills in modelling figurines and vases, gilding, keeping pattern books and hand painting ware: outlining, enamelling (filling in colours within the outline) and banding (the radial bands on plates or vessels). In the early 1920s her immediate boss Jack Walker brought Cliff to the attention of one of the two factory owners, Colley Shorter, who managed it with his brother Guy. Colley Shorter was 17 years older than Cliff, and as well as playing a major role in nurturing her skills and ideas, he was later to be her husband.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{disruptions}} {{and barriers}} are encountered by persons with mobility-related disabilities in their daily’s experience of going <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{and the pressure}} these exert on gaining and maintaining their employment. The {{nature and extent of}} their difficulties to workforce participation entails a requirement for extensive planning and also strategies to address problems of being stranded (for example, when the bus they are waiting for is not accessible). This paper presents the conceptualisation and methods of understanding workforce participation as a journey, and a discussion on the role digital technologies play in helping people with mobility-related disabilities in their <b>journeys</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and mitigating disruptions when these occur. This is presented through an initial case study that helped identify the sequence of supports needed to be in place <b>to</b> make the <b>work</b> <b>journey</b> possible.

40|$|This study uses Census data {{to look at}} travel <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{patterns}} in Nottingham. Spatial trends are identified by analysing how number of <b>journeys</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> distance travelled, commuter flows, method of travel, type of job and type of neighbourhood vary across the study area. Affluent commuters working in managerial and professional roles travelling long distances by car from the rural hinterland to the city centre contrast with people with routine jobs travelling short distances <b>to</b> <b>work</b> from deprived urban neighbourhoods using public transport. Temporal trends are revealed through the comparison of 1991 and 2001 Census data. The number of <b>journeys</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> is increasing, whilst flow patterns are becoming more complex. The environmental impact of travel <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in Nottingham is quantified {{through the application of}} a simple model that estimates the carbon dioxide emissions produced by commuting in each area. The Nottingham Express Transit tram network has been introduced in the city with the aim of reducing congestion and reliance on the car through the provision of an environmentally friendly alternative. The possible environmental benefits of this solution are highlighted by exploring several what-if scenarios. It is concluded that the tram network has the potential to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions...|$|R
