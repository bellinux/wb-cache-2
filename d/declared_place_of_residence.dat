40|$|Question: Outdoor {{occupational}} exposure could {{be associated with}} important cumulative and intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation. Such exposure would increase risk of skin cancer. However, little information exists on jobs associated with intense UV exposure. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterise occupational UV exposure in a representative sample in France. Methods: A population-based survey was conducted in May-June 2012 through computer-assisted telephonic interviews in population 25 to 69 years of age. Individual UV irradiation was computed with <b>declared</b> time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> matched to UV records from satellite measurement (Eurosun project). We analysed factors influencing exposure to UV (annual average and seasonal peak). Results: A total of 1442 individuals declared having an {{occupational exposure}} to UV which represents 18 % of population aged 25 to 69 years. Outdoor workers were more frequently men (58 %), aged 40 - 54 (43 %), with a phototype III or IV (69 %). Occupations associated with highest UV exposure were: construction workers (annual daily average 62. 8 Joules/m 2), gardeners (62. 6), farmers (52. 8), culture/art/social sciences workers (52. 0) and transport workers/mail carriers (49. 5). The maximum of UVA exposure was found for occupation with a strong seasonality of exposure: culture, art or social sciences works (98. 1 Joules/m 2), construction works (97. 2), gardening (96. 7) and farming (95. 0). Significant factors associated with high occupational UV exposure were gender (men vs. women: 53. 6 vs. 42. 6), phototype (IV vs. I: 51. 9 vs. 45. 5) and taking lunch outdoors (always vs. never: 59. 8 vs. 48. 6). Conclusion: Our study showed that some occupations were associated with particularly intense UV exposure such as farmers, gardeners, construction workers. Other unexpected occupations were also associated with high UV exposure such as transport workers, mail carriers and culture/art/social sciences workers...|$|R

The study is based on cellphone data for a medium-sized linguistically divided European city (Tallinn, Estonia), where the Estonian majority and mainly Russianspeaking minority populations are of roughly equal size. The results show that both <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> and work are segregated, while other activities occur in a far more integrated environment.

The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine the differential factors associated with the occurrence of deaths of collision and non-collision automobile users in Patagonia, Argentina. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using as the dependent variable death by car accident (collision or non-collision of the vehicle) and sex, age, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> the victim, relief and population density as the independent variables. Collision fatalities were related to areas of high population density, while non-collision fatalities were related to areas of low population density, mountainous landscape and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> the victims outside the Patagonian region. The results obtained in this study indicate the need to develop differential primary prevention policies by <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>residence</b> <b>of</b> car occupants, focusing on Patagonia nonresident drivers and by emphasizing non-collision accidents...|$|R
