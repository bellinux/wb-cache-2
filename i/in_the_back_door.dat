25|$|In the Western Conference, {{the race}} was tight. Allen Iverson, {{formerly}} the seven-time East point guard starter, moved to Denver from Philadelphia, attracting votes from reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash. But surprisingly, neither of the two was voted in; both were reserves as swingman Tracy McGrady came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> win. Dirk Nowitzki, another player who analysts predicted that would be starting, {{was not able to}} muster enough votes to get over former MVP Kevin Garnett's 1,600,000, but was put in by coaches as a reserve and later added to the starting lineup by West coach Mike D'Antoni. Tim Duncan was also voted in as a forward. Carmelo Anthony, the star small forward for the Nuggets, was not voted in as a starter or reserve, contrary to earlier reports that head coaches from the conference would put him in the lineup despite being involved in a brawl, but was allowed as a reserve (because Carlos Boozer was injured). Mehmet Okur of the Utah Jazz and Ray Allen of the Seattle Sonics were chosen by Stern to replace the injured Nash and Iverson.|$|E
500|$|When he left Davis, Kelly formed his own trio {{with two}} others leaving the trumpeter – Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb. They soon {{embarked}} on a national tour and had recording dates with Verve Records, Kelly having left Vee-Jay after four albums. In May 1964, the calypso track [...] "Little Tracy" [...] from Kelly's Verve album Comin' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Door</b> reached number 38 on Billboards R chart. A few months later, the trio toured Japan for George Wein-organized concerts. In the summer of 1965 they joined Montgomery {{on a tour of}} the US that included an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival, and a club recording released as the Kelly co-led Smokin' at the Half Note. The trio also played together on albums for Joe Henderson and others after leaving Davis. According to Cobb, he took charge of the financial side of the trio, as well as its recruiting of additional members, while Kelly primarily was pianist and responsible for dealing with interviewers. The trio stayed together until 1969, when Chambers died.|$|E

Suzette started up from her pillow, and pulled Adeline's face down on her neck, so as to smother the sound of her sobs. [...] "Hush! Don't let him hear! And I wouldn't let any one know for the world that we didn't agree! You can think it over all day, if you want; and I'll stop Mr. Putney from writing till you think as I do.

60|$|At {{the same}} time she applied her eye to that orifice, and {{instantly}} started back, for she saw the leader of the gang retire a few paces preparatory to making a rush. There was short time for action, nevertheless Bessy was quick enough to fling down a large stool {{in front of the door}} and place herself in an attitude of defence. Next moment the door flew open with a crash, and a sailor sprang in, cutlass in hand. As a matter of course he tripped over the stool, and fell prostrate at Bessy's feet, and the man who followed received such a well-delivered blow from the crutch that he fell on the top of his comrade. While the heroine was in the act of receiving the third she felt both her ankles seized by the man who had fallen first. A piercing yell followed. In attempting to free herself she staggered back and fell, the crutch was wrenched from her grasp, and the whole gang poured over her into the kitchen, where they were met by their comrades, who had just burst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

"I got {{up almost}} blindly, {{felt in the}} cabinet, and found a coin {{and a piece of}} paper, and a feeling of exultation came over me that, after nearly twenty years, I should succeed in {{carrying}} out my vow and taking his bracelet back to the god. I descended the ladder, crept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> by which I had come out, went up to my room, where I had kept a light burning, and examined my treasures. Then I saw that all had been in vain. They were doubtless a key to the mystery, but until a clew was given they were absolutely useless. I sat for hours staring at them. I would have gone back and replaced them in the cabinet and left all as it had been before, but I dared not enter the room again. The next day I heard you say that you suspected that the talk with your father had been overheard, and that the man who had earlier in the evening before shot at him had returned, and while listening had heard something said about the hiding place, and thought that he would find some sort of treasure there. I thought that in the talk your father might have told you how to use these things, though I had not caught it, and it was therefore important that you should have them back again, so I went into the room after the inquest was over, and placed the things in their hiding place again.|$|E
