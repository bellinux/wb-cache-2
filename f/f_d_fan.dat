40|$|Rapidly rising {{energy costs}} present the {{opportunity}} for substantial cost savings through improved boiler combustion control. A process computer control system was installed at an Air Products & Chemicals facility in 1978. As a result the boiler efficiency has increased over 11 %. The control system includes; air flow, fuel flow, pressure and drum level control. Air flow control is achieved through modulation of the <b>F.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>fan</b> inlet vanes. Demand for airflow is produced from a high signal selection of the steam pressure controller or the total fuel signal. The output of the oxygen controller is used to modify this airflow index by the desired air/fuel ratio. The air/fuel ratio is a polynomial function {{of the type of}} fuel used. In summary, the computer control system provides for; greater overall boiler stability, operation within tight air/gas limits, increased boiler efficiency, capability to burn multiple fuels, faster response to demand changes, and fewer shutdowns...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of fuel moisture content {{on a large}} spatial scale requires several observations and estimates and is often time consuming and costly due to labour and transportation expenses. Therefore, various models based on empirical functions of weather variables have been developed and applied to {{determine the amount of}} moisture in fuel. In this paper, a fuel dryness index (<b>F</b> <b>d)</b> based on biophysical principles associated with energy exchange is presented and applied to monitor fuel moisture content for annual grasslands. Daily values of <b>F</b> <b>d</b> were determined as the ratio of sensible heat flux density to the available energy using high-frequency temperature data and the surface renewal (SR) method in combination with net radiation and soil heat flux values. The SR method was evaluated by comparing with sensible and latent heat flux densities from eddy covariance data measured in a fire-vulnerable annual grassland. The <b>F</b> <b>d</b> values and trends were compared with three well-known slow response fire-danger indices including the Keetch–Byram drought index, two modified versions of the drought factor in the McArthur forest fire-danger meter, and the fast response fine fuel moisture code of the Canadian fire weather index. Moreover, <b>F</b> <b>d</b> index was compared with the McArthur grassland fire-danger meter. The <b>F</b> <b>d</b> index was more responsive to daily changes than most of the other indices, providing accurate information on fuel dryness condition of a live vegetation grassland. In addition, it can potentially eliminate the need for calibrated empirical weather models and fuel stick measurements...|$|R
