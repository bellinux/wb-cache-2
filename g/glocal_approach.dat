Two typically approaches used are: global, which follows a variation of the original lexical paradigm, and local, which is indigenous in methods and assumptions. We propose a <b>GloCal</b> <b>approach</b> that is more likely to yield a comprehensive picture of personality by combining approaches informed by a thorough understanding of that language and culture. The <b>GloCal</b> <b>approach</b> allows researchers to (a) identify shared and unique components of personality across cultures, (b) ensure that the lexicon used is relevant to the culture and (c) increase the ecological validity of stimulus materials in personality inventories...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriateness}} of following a globally standardized or locally adapted strategy in global marketing has been {{subject of an}} on-going debate for several decades. However, little research exists of how to follow standardization and adaptation (s/a) simultaneously and {{to take advantage of}} both strategies, in brief how to follow a <b>GloCal</b> <b>approach.</b> Thus, the purpose of this case study is to generate theoretical insights of how to follow a GloCal strategy, based on the case of Facebook. After reviewing critical points of current knowledge in the field of s/a, qualitative research via open-ended in-depth interviews from a sample of Facebook users from 16 different countries was conducted. The outcome supports that common needs and individual usage behavior of Facebook users favor a strategy that is simultaneously standardized and adapted, within different aspects of the product element. Results are presented narratively intertwined with theory and prior study results. Findings reveal that Facebook is following a <b>GloCal</b> <b>approach.</b> By abstracting from the case of Facebook to a general level theoretical insights are gained of how t...|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of both emic (local) and etic (global) knowledge {{is an alternative}} goal {{for the implementation of}} ethnomodeling research. Emic knowledge is essential for an intuitive and empathic understanding of mathematical ideas, procedures, and practices developed by the members of distinct cultural groups. It is essential for conducting effective ethnographic fieldwork. Furthermore, emic knowledge is a valuable source of inspiration for etic hypotheses. Etic knowledge is essential for cross-cultural comparisons, which are based on the components of ethnology. In this regard, such comparisons demand standard units and categories to facilitate communication. Dialogical (glocal) is a third approach for ethnomodeling research that makes use of both emic and etic knowledge traditions through processes of dialogue and interaction. Ethnomodeling is defined as the study of mathematical phenomena within a culture because it is a social construct and is culturally bound. Finally, the objective {{of this article is to}} show how we have come to use a combination of emic, etic and dialogical (<b>glocal)</b> <b>approaches</b> in our work in the area of ethnomodeling, which contributes to the {{acquisition of}} a more complete understanding of mathematical practices developed by the members of distinct cultural groups...|$|R

Although the global strategy approach does recognize the need to localize products in the global community, local strategy stresses the importance of local adaptations in relation to the local marketplace. Also, while global strategy emphasizes standardization of global products, local strategy explains the balance that must exist between the standardization and local adaptation of business activities and products.|$|R

In this article, we consider these questions as they apply to U. S. law firms, and offer a new lens to interpret the role of globalization in the activities of law firms and their lawyers. We use data relating to the overseas offices of 64 leading U. S. -based law firms - among the largest and most globally-oriented U.

A multidisciplinary, <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> helps scholars and policymakers to transcend such territorial traps and understand how scale is used as a political tool by social actors. This chapter explains how a scale is constructed in different issue areas. It also explains the affect of this construction on governance at multiple levels of governance. The chapter updates that theoretical framework based on iterative applications of the existing framework to case studies and subsequent revisions of the theoretical framework. This framework identifies four types of motivation that lead countries and social actors to scale an issue up or down in relation to the administrative scale. This framework is then applied to three case studies (water, forests, and climate change). The chapter compares and contrasts how the politics of scale play out in each area...|$|E

These collaborative enterprise networks are operating many times under a <b>glocal</b> <b>approach,</b> which means that they have less time to react, to properly evolve and more challenges to face, mainly the fact of operate both locally (product design, sales) and globally (manufacturing, distribution). In this context, collaborative enterprise networks need to manage not only their classic operations (costs, quality, response, flexibility, etc) but they also need to integrally incorporate to their management and decision-making systems their collaborative practices regarding evolution and innovation. Then, this work presents an evolved performance measurement system to manage collaborative enterprise networks operations including co-innovation and co-evolution practices. Such a system has got four phases and, through the identification and quantification of relationships among performance elements, it offers a new management approach, which will provide collaborative enterprise network decision-makers with additional and meaningful information...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that exploiting label correlations {{is important to}} multi-label learning. Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, {{it is also a}} usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label <b>approach</b> <b>GLOCAL</b> dealing with both the full-label and the missing-label cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{focuses on}} the {{formalization}} of medical practices in chronic inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis as a contextual graph to identify a consensual methodology. Expert knowledge is more than domain knowledge because expert knowledge emerges from a contextualization process and expertise appears as “chunks of contextual knowledge”. The knowledge acquisition phase and the modeling of the expertise were organized around three workshops about the choice of diseases to study, the observation of how pathologists worked, the identification of similarity of pathologists ’ approaches and the proposal of a unified view. The “knowledge manager ” was a physician knowing the expert knowledge used by experts but without their experience. A glocal search was identified {{in the decision-making process}} with a global exploration for detecting zones of interest, and a zoom inside zones of interest. This search concerns contextual elements at different levels of granularity as identified from the analysis of digital slides. The rest of the decision-making process includes the application of a set of criteria that are managed by a voting system that offers flexibility to address the variety of expert approaches. We discuss the role of the <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> in other domains like Control & Command rooms for the army and subway-line monitoring...|$|E

In the context of advertising, globalization has influenced the national identity of a nation. Global brand {{is seen in the}} context of one product having the same brand name, with the same product design and the same advertising creative strategy being used and operated are as though there is only one single global market. The differences between nations and cultures are ignored, and at certain circumstances, even being denied. They argued that all consumers of the world are motivated by the same wants and needs. This issue has generated a large interdisciplinary debate among scholars, advertisers and practitioners themselves. To address this issue, 200 television commercials are content analyzed in an attempt to examine how commercials in Malaysia tackled the issue, especially in balancing Western images and influences against the portraying of local identities. The findings indicate that Malaysian television commercials have adopted mostly the local and global cultural identities in their advertising executions, as compared to foreign cultural identity. In fact, the <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> in their advertising creative is also prevalent. On the other hand, another form of standardization, namely Asian standardization, has been found in the research findings as another strategic advertising form used by advertisers...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation versus {{standardization}} dilemma {{has been}} coined {{as a major}} issue within the international marketing literature for the past fifty years, and academic research has showed that the extreme positions were unbearable and that the virtue lied in a middle position between these two positions. This opened space for another stream of research devoted to analyze and discuss the level of control and autonomy that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) should grant to their subsidiaries. In this paper, we analyze the impact of subsidiaries’ capacity to innovate in marketing in an emerging economy. Thus, {{the main purpose of}} this study is to explore marketing autonomy in Multinational Enterprises’ subsidiaries to innovate and develop new products and services to the Brazilian telecommunications market. Using the grid proposed by Lasserre, several interviews to senior managers of Telefónica were conducted in order to evaluate the level of autonomy of Telefonica’s Brazilian subsidiary. The results show that Telefónica uses a <b>glocal</b> <b>approach,</b> since its subsidiary has autonomy to create and adapt its products when the headquarters recognize that global decisions might not meet local demands. Despite being a single case study, Telefóncia is a giant in the telecommunication sector, operating in numerous countries, thus the current insights on the way the company runs global operations may be helpful not only for researchers but also for other companies...|$|E

These strategies are shaped by {{the influence of the}} international market environment, which involves a different set of dynamics. Marketing managers take decisions concerning the extent to which standardization and adaptation will be utilized by first conducting detailed analyses regarding the various factors associated with the countries they are trying to appeal to. In recent years, the strategy mainly adopted by businesses when taking product decision in global markets is the “think global act local” approach –in other words, the <b>glocal</b> <b>approach.</b> Owing to the approach, many businesses operating in global markets are able to continuously increase their effectiveness and share in markets, and to thereby become winners through successful efforts. In this context, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine and evaluate, within the scope of standardization and adaptation, the product strategies implemented in the Turkish market by Knorr, a successful brand in the food industry, for its dry soup products. Knorr is also one of the businesses of Unilever, a company that occupies an important place in the global market, and also represents the world’s largest fast moving consumer good company.

Methodology. A large amount of available sources of information devoted to glocal marketing is analysed {{in order to achieve}} the {{purpose of the}} research. The research covers and highlights the concepts and ideas concerning this marketing, the sources of which are works that meet such requirements of information as relevance and reliability best of all. MOreover, the author's definition of the concept of glocal marketing is given. Mondelēz International is considered in the paper {{as an example of a}} company that uses the <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> in marketing. The choice of a company for analysis is so, in particular, because various representatives of Mondelēz International argue that this company uses a glocal strategy to promote its products in different countries of the world. Marketing mix of Mondelēz International is considered in the paper on the example of products under such trademarks as Barni, belVita, Oreo, Picnic, Tang and Toblerone. Results. The paper sums up the theoretical foundations of glocal marketing and considers the practical examples of the use of such marketing. There are numerous differences between countries, such as: social, technological, economic, environmental, political, legal and ethical. It means that marketing has common and distinctive features in different countries. The local aspects of marketing activities have an impact on the determination of global marketing orientation of a company. At the same time, every global marketing problem has its local display, and therefore requires a <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> in solving the problem. Glocal marketing is marketing combining the advantages of global and local approaches, taking into account trends and changes in the marketing environment generated by the dialectics of unity and struggle of the global and the local. Combining the ideas of global marketing and local marketing allows allay or even completely avoid the shortcomings occurring if only global or only local approach is used. The same products of a company may be under another trademarks, have a variety of flavours or forms depending on a country. The product price correlates with inputs. Mondelēz International often chooses the reduction of its product weight rather than the rise of product price. Mondelēz International sells its products in 165 countries organized into five segments. Each segment has its own structure of product consumption and other peculiarities. The product promotion depends on the features of a product. The positioning of a product may not differ in different countries, but advertising may be altered depending on the market if needed. The analysis of different sources of information as well as the research of marketing mix confirms with specific examples that Mondelēz International uses glocal marketing. Practical implications. The advantages and at the same time the distinctive features of the implementation of glocal marketing are marked out while considering the theoretical foundations of the research. Such distinctive features have also been supported by specific examples of activities of Mondelēz International. The research has confirmed the existing theoretical achievements in the field of glocal marketing. The research is also a continuation and further development of these achievements, concepts and ideas. Value/originality. Specific examples of activities of Mondelēz International, adduced in the paper, combined with theoretical foundations of the issue of glocal marketing, are logically united and mutually complementary. The further development of scientific understanding of the concept of glocal marketing is obtained, as well as the implementation of its principles in practice. It will help, in particular, to large transnational corporations to conduct efficiently their activities in markets of different countries under conditions of cultural differentiation manifested in diversity of needs, tastes and preferences of local consumers. All this is intended for the reduction of costs and the increase of revenues of such corporations in conditions of the current marketing environment, as well as the maximization of satisfaction of the customers' needs in different countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to problematize and detail how Social Work Education can be seen in higher {{education}} from the perspective of migration and internationalization out of a swedish context. With internationalization is intended everyone the activities that aim to stimulate exchange and knowledge development, irrespective of it concerns students, teachers or other staff category. Migration problems and challenges needs to be seen in a local and global context and the education needs to be characterized by this. In social work education, migration and internationalization means that one creates conditions for cooperation and understanding between the average nations, at home in our professional daily and abroad through various exchanges in studies, research and practice placements. Education in migration intends a deeper cross-border integration in which students coming from different cultures, traditions develop their skills and understanding through different pedagogical and didactic aspects. The language of migration and how we face it is to a high degree incomplete and how we use terms and words is very much based on our contexts in which media is a part not the least when it comes to the role of metaphors and stigmatization. The {{purpose of this}} article is to problematize and to show how curriculum in International Social work education from a Swedish perspective can be developed and seen in the aspects of migration and integrative didactics in internationalization.

40|$|The {{concept of}} cross culture and {{cultural}} identity of multinationals operating in various {{countries have been}} challenged by the notion of globalisation {{in the course of}} these last centuries. Thus, the question of cultural specificities has been put in jeopardy and has challenged organisations ‘desire to create an original cultural identity in order to differentiate them in this competitive market. This study explores the cultural interactions within the corporate identity of a French bank: BNP Paribas in Bahrain. The research tends to identify the cultural impacts of the French/European and the Bahraini Middle Eastern culture on the bank’s visual communication media. Because the bank is operating in a region rules by Islam, the purpose of the thesis is to understand to which extent BNP Paribas adheres to the cultural specificities of Bahrain and the Middle East in correlation with the corporate own national identity (French/ European). A mixed method approach of a case study including semiotics and iconography visuals analysis of the bank’s communication media and semi-structured interviews of communication professionals has been followed. The findings revealed that BNP Paribas did adapt its communication to the local Arabic Middle Eastern culture keeping therefore their own cultural code mainly derived from the French European cultural identity. Further, the bank did avoid religious symbols with the concern of portraying an alliance and unity between both countries which have created a global culture expressed through cultural patterns and stereotypes. The bank’ main communication strategy in term of culture is to be ‘glocal’. They tend to represent the local culture within a global idea of culture. As a result, the bank avoided deeper cultural symbolism such as the religious ones to only focus on portraying a cultural identity representing harmony, social unity and alliance between both European and Middle Eastern countries. In creating a <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> through a bricolage of culture mixing French and Arabic cultural themes, BNP Paribas puts in scene cultural similarities between both countries and takes the risk to promote a global culture where cultural specificities that actively participate to the construction of identity are wiped out...|$|E

These spaces shall be settled at local level as a <b>glocal</b> <b>approach</b> to be of economic boost and new opportunities globally. In the current economic climate a sustainable socio-attitude is proposed.

We act on this urban facts understanding architecture in a positive sense, as a creation linked to civil life and society, being collective in its own. In the current economic situation, a urban project, to be considered sustainable, must go further the limits of his physical surrounding, with an ideological projection beyond his neighborhood. We took the opportunity to think over those places and {{give them a chance to}} go into the prospect of global cities. Those spaces will be cause for economic boost, new opportunities and a new international interest. We start from Global City term to understand the features needed to obtain this status. Factors such as international notoriety and multiculturalism are yet present in Berlin, Barcelona and Cairo. We will try to detect the latent realities in the 3 places, using them as the reason of being of the projects. Avoid the generic city defined by Rem Kool(2006), escape the loss of identity mistake of those sites. We do not want that cities with such singularity and history like the 3 cities of our research, over simplifying their identity, become generic. They will turn transparent, just like a logo. We want its own identity as part of its complexity and individuality. Interventions in the field of GAT, according to the proposed theory, must be considered as marketing operations in its intention of being refered to the Global Cities. The Global City’s achieves to boost the economy of its environment and of its entire country. We should try to find the most appropriate "Ferris whell" 3 for each city.

Squares will need to be an icon, a symbol of the city you can extrapolate and sell. It could also be helpful to give use to the individual, but especially to the mass, so that thousands of people can enjoy the experience and services offered by these sites.
