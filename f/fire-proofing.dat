5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its <b>fire-proofing</b> and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, ongoing {{modifications}} to the Treasury Building concerned Young, expected to create working drawings based on plans by Walter. For the South Wing, he invented a column capital which symbolized the department, substituting acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order with eagles and a fist holding a key. Young held the role until he retired on July 24, 1862, dismissed by Salmon P. Chase of the Lincoln administration. Chase's friend from Cincinnati, Isaiah Rogers, succeeded him as Supervising Architect, although the Civil War curtailed the department's activities. Several of Young's buildings would {{play a part in}} the rebellion, particularly his custom house in Richmond, Virginia, which served as the Confederate Treasury. When Richmond in April 1865 was evacuated by the Army of Northern Virginia, with orders to burn warehouses and factories, the Richmond Custom House survived the conflagration—a testament to its <b>fire-proofing.</b> Indeed, from its courtroom Jefferson Davis was indicted for treason in May 1866.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFire-proof sealing and {{plugging}} in building {{is an important}} technical means of building fire protection {{as well as the}} emphasis and difficulty of current construction area. From the starting point of analysing the principle of <b>fire-proof</b> sealing and {{plugging in}} building and analysing some key influence factors, this paper originally proposes the composite applications of <b>fire-proof</b> sealing technical measures, on the basis of combining the engineering application. Then taking the new <b>fire-proof</b> sealing sheet for representative example, it introduces the current situation of <b>fire-proof</b> sealing product and gives reasons analysis. At last, it brings up corresponding suggestions from four aspects: the product quality, product standard, product selection and construction application, trying to provide some new thoughts and methods for solving <b>fire-proof</b> sealing and plugging problem...|$|R

25|$|On 9 December 1621, the Fortune {{burned to}} the ground, taking with it the company's stock of plays and properties. To meet the £1000 cost of rebuilding, Alleyn formed a {{partnership}} of twelve sharers, each paying an initial amount of £83 6s. 8d. By then aged and busy with Dulwich College, he took only one share for himself, and leased the property to the company's sharers for £128 per year. (The shareholders paid Alleyn £10 13s. 10d. each annually, and in return split the profits of the theatre, and the expenses of running it, twelve ways.) The theatre re-opened in March 1623. When Alleyn died in 1626, the College assumed control of the lease; the actor Richard Gunnell became its manager. Yet this change {{does not appear to}} have changed operations at the theatre. The new theatre appears to have been made of brick, with a lead and tile roof as <b>fire-proofing</b> measure. It also seems to have been round, abandoning its unconventional square shape.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010 Eurotunnel, HS1 Ltd, DB {{and other}} {{interested}} train operators formed {{a working group}} to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing 200-metre trains. The Intergovernmental Commission currently requires trains to be 400m long. Deutsche Bahn carried out evacuation trials in the tunnel on 17 October 2010 with two 200m-long ICE3 trains, and displayed one of them at St Pancras station on 19 October. The current Velaro ICE3 sets {{do not meet the}} fire safety requirements for passenger services through the tunnel, but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional <b>fire-proofing.</b> In March 2011, the European Rail Agency decided to allow trains with distributed traction to operate in the Channel Tunnel. DB is planning three services a day to Frankfurt (5h from London), Rotterdam (3h) and Amsterdam (4h) via Brussels from 2015. This had originally planned to be 2013, but has been delayed due to the availability of the Channel Tunnel version of the Siemens Velaro D trains, high rental costs of the French rail network and border controls in their stations. As of 2016, nothing yet has come to fruition, but the High Speed One website continues to state that [...] "HS1 Ltd are working with Deutsche Bahn on plans to incorporate three additional international return journeys, between Frankfurt and London via Cologne, Brussels and Lille. This will include connections from Amsterdam via Rotterdam to London." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{system had}} a {{relatively}} low capacity, but the Docklands area very quickly developed into a major financial centre and employment zone, increasing traffic. In particular Tower Gateway, {{at the edge of}} the City of London, attracted criticism for its poor connections, as it did not connect directly with the nearby Tower Hill tube station or Fenchurch Street railway station. The criticism arose partly because the system usage was higher than expected. Plans were developed, before the system opened, to extend it to [...] in the west and Beckton in the east. Stations and trains were extended to two-unit length, and the system was expanded into the heart of the City of London to [...] through a tunnel, which opened in 1991. This extension left [...] on a stub. The original trains were not suitable for use underground due to a lack of <b>fire-proofing.</b> They were operated for a time on the above-ground sections only, and were later sold.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{introduces a}} methodology of establishing indicators of fire {{safety of a}} building {{in relation to a}} guaranteed duration of steel <b>fire-proof</b> corrugated beams resistance in conditions of standard fire tests. Indicators of fire safety are also established in the assessment of design limits of steel <b>fire-proof</b> corrugated beams during design process, construction or maintenance of the building as well as in reducing economic costs when testing steel structures for fire resisting property. The suggested methodology introduces the system of actions aimed to design constructive fire protection of steel corrugated beams of buildings. Technological effect is achieved by conducting firing tests of steel construction by non-destructive methods; the evaluation of fire resistance of <b>fire-proof</b> elements of corrugated beams (corrugated web, upper and lower shelves) is identified by the least <b>fire-proof</b> element of a welded I-beam. In this methodology fire resistance duration of the constituent elements of a welded I-beam with account of its fire protection ability is described with an analytic function taken as variables. These variables are intensity strength of stresses and the degree of fire protection of a compound element...|$|R
