5000|$|First {{built-in}} <b>flash</b> <b>socket,</b> {{activated by}} the shutter, in 1935.|$|E
50|$|It bases on the Nikon Coolpix P7700, i.e. same lens system, <b>flash</b> <b>socket</b> and {{the same}} {{functionality}} regarding to the excellent operating modes and connectivity: mini-HDMI, USB-2, PAL/NTSC, remote sensor, external flash and for GPS-devices, among them Nikon GP1 and Dawn di-GPS line.|$|E
50|$|The {{product range}} is mainly focused on studio photography, and {{includes}} battery powered flash generators for situations where portability is needed. There are remote control units {{that can be}} attached to a digital camera's <b>flash</b> <b>socket</b> {{and take advantage of}} flash synchronization and automatic through-the-lens measuring functionalities. Profoto also sells speed rings, softboxes, rasters, and other tools that shape the light cone. The battery powered AirTTL flash units B1 and B2 have been noted for their robustness and portability. At Photokina 2016 in Germany, Profoto launched AirTTL studio flashes D2 and Pro-10, as well as the Air Remote TTL-S which was made in collaboration with Sony.|$|E
5000|$|... ???: 512 kB ISA {{flash card}} {{used in the}} {{original}} NTI PIX, PIX Classic and 10000. It is manufactured by Productivity Enhancement Products. Aside from progressive manufacturing refinements, the 512 KB and 2 MB flash cards were identical aside from the chips that populated it. Both booted from a 28F256 chip, but the 512 KB card only populated two of the <b>flash</b> <b>sockets</b> with 28F020 chips, while the 2 MB card populated all four sockets with 29C040 chips ...|$|R
5000|$|PC flash sync socket: As built, the T90 lacks a {{separate}} <b>flash</b> sync <b>socket.</b> The addition of {{one could be}} performed by request by Canon support centers. If so modified, it is fitted on the left-hand side of the prism housing, as seen by the user.|$|R
50|$|There are 2 <b>Flash</b> Memory <b>sockets</b> {{available}} (80pin, 120ns), {{with the}} maximum flash memory supported being 16MB. Standard flash memory was 8MB on most routers and 4mb on 'Mission Specific' models. A boot ROM upgrade {{may be needed}} to use 16MB of flash. The 2500 ran its IOS directly from flash memory.|$|R
5000|$|The enthusiast-built [...] "IDE64 interface" [...] was {{designed}} {{late in the}} 1990s, attaching itself in the Commodore 64's expansion port, and allowing users to attach common IDE hard drives, CD-ROM and DVD drives, ZiP and LS-120 floppy drives to their Commodore 64s. Later revisions of the interface board provided an extra compact <b>flash</b> <b>socket.</b> The IDE interface's performance {{is comparable to the}} RAMLink in speed, but lacks the intelligence of SCSI. Its main advantage lies in being able to use inexpensive commodity hard drives instead of the more costly SCSI units. 1541 compatibility is not as good as commercially developed hard drive subsystems, but continues to improve with time.|$|E
50|$|This technique, used by Cbox {{and other}} chat applications, {{makes use of}} the XMLSocket object in a single-pixel Adobe Flash movie. Under the control of JavaScript, the client {{establishes}} a TCP connection to a unidirectional relay on the server. The relay server does not read anything from this socket; instead it immediately sends the client a unique identifier. Next, the client makes an HTTP request to the web server, including with it this identifier. The web application can then push messages addressed to the client to a local interface of the relay server, which relays them over the <b>Flash</b> <b>socket.</b> The advantage {{of this approach is}} that it appreciates the natural read-write asymmetry that is typical of many web applications, including chat, and as a consequence it offers high efficiency. Since it does not accept data on outgoing sockets, the relay server does not need to poll outgoing TCP connections at all, making it possible to hold open tens of thousands of concurrent connections. In this model, the limit to scale is the TCP stack of the underlying server operating system.|$|E
50|$|Listed top-to-bottom (looking at the <b>flash</b> shoe <b>socket</b> as pictured above, or {{with the}} camera {{positioned}} with the lens pointing up): The electrical interface and protocol is backward-compatible with the older Minolta hotshoe, except for {{that it does not}} support the F4 signal, which was provided by the first generation of Minolta AF SLRs to control the AF illuminator, as this function became part of the digital protocol.|$|R
50|$|The FG {{can only}} connect to flashes via the hot shoe connection, as it lacks a PC sync <b>socket.</b> <b>Flashes</b> {{which do not}} have a hot shoe can be used with a hot shoe-sync cord adapter.|$|R
50|$|More {{subtle changes}} include a revised top shutter speed of 1/3000 s. The {{optional}} winder offered an improved battery cover, a well-known weak {{component in the}} Auto 110. The shutter button is protected from accidental tripping by an altered casing around the button. The <b>flash</b> synchronization <b>socket</b> cover on the Super was permanently attached to the camera {{in an attempt to}} prevent loss, though many still go missing when the plastic tether breaks.|$|R
50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The {{shutter release button}} is situated on the right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial <b>flash</b> synchronising <b>socket</b> is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the shutter release button.|$|R
50|$|Automatic flash {{bracketing}} (sometimes {{abbreviated to}} FBR for Flash Bracketing or FEB for Flash Exposure Bracketing) is typically performed by altering the flash output of a connected dedicated flash accordingly. Using non-dedicated studio flashes, for example on the PC <b>socket,</b> <b>flash</b> bracketing {{can be carried}} out by altering the aperture, however, this will also affect ambient light and the depth of field.|$|R
5000|$|... 1933: Ihagee VP Exakta (Germany): first 127 {{roll film}} SLR. Preliminary designs were on paper by June 1932. Took eight {{exposures}} of 4×6.5 cm (1⅝×2½ inch) nominal frames (40×62 mm actual frames) on 127 [...] "Vest Pocket" [...] roll film, {{and had a}} folding waist level finder and focal-plane shutter. The 1935 version was the first camera with a built-in <b>flash</b> synchronization <b>socket</b> (called Vacublitz) to automatically synchronize the recently invented flashbulb (first marketed as Vacublitz in 1929) with its shutter. The VP also established the oblong body shape and handling soon to be standard in 35 mm SLRs except that Exakta SLRs had primarily left-handed controls and were more trapezoidal shaped than rectangular.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{photographic}} studio {{strobe lights}} have [...] in or 3.5 mm jacks for the flash synchronization input. A camera's electrical <b>flash</b> output (PC <b>socket</b> or hot shoe adapter) is cabled to the strobe light's sync input jacks. Some examples: Calumet Travelite, and Speedotron use a [...] in mono jack as the sync input; White Lightning uses [...] in stereo jacks; PocketWizard (radio trigger) and AlienBees use 3.5 mm mono jacks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The WebSocket {{makes the}} web {{application}} {{to deal with}} the web data directly in the HTML 5 and it provides full-duplex communications channels using TCP connection. Some traditional web communication technologies and their shortcomings are introduced such as polling, long polling, stream and <b>flash</b> xml <b>socket</b> in this paper. The principle of the web socket is introduced and a WebSocket server is developed which can be used in the real time web environment. The server includes two modules which include the socket listener and the communication socket. The server implements the WebSocket handshake protocol and the data transfer protocol. The server is developed by C++ language which can provide high efficiency data operation and network transportation. The program is more scalability and flexibility and it uses the universal interface to implement the core functions of web socket with the CAsyncSocket...|$|R
5000|$|The {{photograph}} above {{shows the}} external <b>flash</b> connection <b>socket</b> {{in the upper}} right corner. The red lever selects among M, F, and X flash synchronizations. The shutter button is barely visible over the letter [...] "h" [...] of [...] "Ricoh." [...] The two large knobs are designed to let the user's two index fingers rapidly focus the camera while following basketball players or other rapidly moving subjects. The wired mount for an external flash unit {{is shown in the}} center of the top view of the camera. The rapid film advance lever shown in the bottom view pivots on its right end and is pulled by the extension (shown folded out of the way) near the lens barrel. The bottom view also shows a reminder ring for noting the speed of the film currently in use.|$|R
