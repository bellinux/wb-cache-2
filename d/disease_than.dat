5|$|Aging (C.elegans and crickets). A 2017 {{review and}} {{meta-analysis}} {{found that people}} with diabetes who were taking metformin had significantly lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> those on other therapies.|$|E
5|$|A {{cohort study}} {{suggested}} that treatment of FH with statins {{leads to a}} 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease {{to a point where}} people are no more likely to die of coronary heart <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> the general population. However, if the person already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Latinos {{have higher}} rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and {{infectious}} <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> do non-Latinos.|$|R
50|$|Wheat {{is subject}} to more <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> other grains, and, in some seasons, {{especially}} in wet ones, heavier losses are sustained from those <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> are in other cereal crops. Wheat may suffer from the attack of insects at the root; from blight, which primarily affects the leaf or straw, and ultimately deprives the grain of sufficient nourishment; from mildew on the ear; and from gum of different shades, which lodges on the chaff or cups in which the grain is deposited.|$|R

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|New York's {{support for}} the Union cause continued, however grudgingly, and {{gradually}} Southern sympathies declined in the city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the state's industries were more productive {{than those of the}} entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000 soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State, which was the most populous state at the time. A total of 46,000 military men from New York State died during the war, more from <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> wounds.|$|E
5|$|Since David {{wrote about}} Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary {{researchers}} {{showed in the}} 1950s that people around the Mediterranean had less coronary heart <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualty}} rate amongst British and Empire troops, excluding the Africans, was 6,000 dead and 3,000 wounded. More troops died from <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> from enemy action, and illness accounted for 70% {{of the total}} casualties.|$|R
25|$|A 2013 review did {{not find}} any effect from supplementation on the rates of <b>disease,</b> other <b>than</b> a {{tentative}} decrease in mortality in the elderly. Low vitamin D levels may result from <b>disease</b> rather <b>than</b> cause <b>disease.</b>|$|R
50|$|Percentage {{body fat}} (PBF), which is {{calculated}} as total body fat (TBFat) divided by total mass multiplied by 100, {{is a direct}} measure to know body fat and a better predictor of risk of obesity-related <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> BMI.|$|R
5|$|The {{spread of}} disease was {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Human-raised R. norvegicus {{are more}} prone to {{specific}} health risks and <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet.|$|R
30|$|Motivated {{by these}} results, {{we suggest that}} the local {{government}} should devote more attention to infectious <b>diseases</b> <b>than</b> to other general diseases. We also suggest that to reduce regional disparity, the medical insurance system should provide more support for the western residents of China.|$|R
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|Treatment in {{the first}} stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and {{treatment}} side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use. However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients whose quality of life is impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> the relation to the global society.|$|E

5000|$|While {{working on}} {{plantations}} in the Southern United States, many slaves faced serious health problems.

5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} of the ghetto, he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to <b>disease</b> <b>than</b> in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
