5|$|The {{process of}} using the 256 {{graphics}} tiles on the NES was handled with special programming techniques. The team streamlined the process by <b>dividing</b> <b>the</b> number of tiles into two groups of 128 and separating them into enemy characters and protagonists.

5|$|Before long, Bohemond granted Jabala (which {{was still}} to be conquered) to the Templars {{although}} Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers. The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, <b>dividing</b> <b>the</b> town between them. However, Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property in Antioch, Pelagius excommunicated him.|$|E
5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were <b>dividing</b> <b>the</b> country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession.

On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, <b>dividing</b> <b>the</b> 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

Canterbury retained the sees in the south and southeast. Hygeberht, already Bishop of Lichfield, was the new archdiocese's first and only archbishop.|$|E
5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H.

However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E
