25|$|Graphite has a layered, planar structure. The {{individual}} layers {{are called}} graphene. <b>In</b> <b>each</b> <b>layer,</b> the carbon atoms {{are arranged in}} a honeycomb lattice with separation of 0.142nm, and the distance between planes is 0.335nm. Atoms in the plane are bonded covalently, with {{only three of the}} four potential bonding sites satisfied. The fourth electron is free to migrate in the plane, making graphite electrically conductive. However, it does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane. Bonding between layers is via weak van der Waals bonds, which allows layers of graphite to be easily separated, or to slide past each other.|$|E

2500|$|Particles {{that are}} {{produced}} in accelerators {{must also be}} observed, {{and this is the}} task of particle detectors. While interesting phenomena may occur when protons collide {{it is not enough to}} just produce them. Particle detectors must be built to detect particles, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the interaction point where the particle beams collide, particle detectors are usually designed in layers like an onion. The layers are made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. [...] The different traces that particles leave <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>layer</b> of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. (The role of each layer in the detector is discussed below.) As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure and stop higher-energy particles. ATLAS is the largest detector ever built at a particle collider.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{agent-based}} {{simulation model}} for analyzing adaptive processes of organizations with organizational learning. The model {{is based on}} a framework of organizational cybernetics and represents organizational activities both decision-makings and task resolutions. Organizational cybernetics helps us to grasp an organization concretely as an aggregation of functions. The model provides four functional layers (self-organization, adaptation, coordination, and process) and interactions among them. The activities of decision-makings correspond to processes of organizational learning, and the activities of task resolutions are performed as in Computational Organization Theory (COT). In the COT {{it should be pointed out}} that there are few researches to introduce both functional hierarchies and the concept of the organizational learning <b>in</b> <b>each</b> functional <b>layer.</b> <b>In</b> <b>each</b> functional <b>layer,</b> the organizational learning realizes the progress of the ability of making decisions to fulfill good performances of the organization as a whole. In this paper we confirm several desired factors on effective criteria in an adaptive learning mechanism: how to learn for the adaptation to the environment <b>in</b> <b>each</b> functional <b>layer?</b> <b>In</b> <b>each</b> functional <b>layer,</b> we propose better criteria for the organizational performance. In the self-organization and the adaptation layer, it works to use the inter-organizational learning for the evaluation of individuals’ internal models.
