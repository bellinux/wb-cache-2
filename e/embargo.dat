5|$|Another {{example of}} an <b>embargo</b> is the United States <b>embargo</b> against Cuba. This is still an ongoing <b>embargo,</b> and, due to the declining {{situation}} and health of Cuba's people, the <b>embargo</b> has been subject to much protest.|$|E
5|$|An <b>embargo</b> is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an <b>embargo.</b> In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an <b>embargo</b> on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the <b>embargo</b> was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their <b>embargo,</b> Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade <b>embargo,</b> since ending the <b>embargo</b> required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E

40|$|UN arms <b>embargoes</b> {{have been}} {{increasingly}} applied to civil wars, yet these <b>embargoes</b> {{have tended to}} be either irrelevant or malevolent in their effects. Arms <b>embargoes</b> are rarely enforced in a civil war; they undermine the credibility of the UN; they are unlikely to change the political positions of civil war participants; they criminalise target societies; and they benefit arms suppliers willing to break the rules. This article argues for the reform of partial arms <b>embargoes,</b> which target select groups in a civil war. It also argues for the restriction in use of impartial <b>embargoes,</b> which apply to all sides in a civil war. Enforcing impartial <b>embargoes</b> can actually make the situation worse, by shaping the course of the civil war in unpredictable and immoral ways...|$|R
50|$|<b>Embargoed</b> is a UK-based {{human rights}} {{organisation}} campaigning {{to bring an}} immediate and unconditional end to all <b>embargoes</b> against the people of Northern Cyprus. <b>Embargoed</b> does not proscribe any political remedy, but considers the <b>embargoes</b> {{on the people of}} Northern Cyprus to be unjust and immoral. It does not consider itself a nationalist organisation, and its manifesto commits it to being multi-cultural, and avoiding politics. The group also campaigns for 1964 to be recognised as the start of the <b>embargoes,</b> this being the year of the breakdown of the power sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots (see Cyprus dispute).|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain <b>embargo</b> upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful <b>embargo</b> food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries {{announced}} an oil <b>embargo</b> against the United States {{in retaliation for}} its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the <b>embargo</b> had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding {{a solution to the}} problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.|$|E
5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an <b>embargo</b> was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this <b>embargo</b> remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the <b>embargo</b> was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The <b>embargo</b> created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} {{reiterated that}} {{the obligations of}} all states to implement Security Council decisions relating to arms <b>embargoes</b> and were encouraged to make violations of the <b>embargoes</b> a criminal offence. It encouraged the improved monitoring of arms <b>embargoes</b> through regional exchanges of information, such as through the OAU, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). All states were to report on violations of the arms <b>embargoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Baghdad Resolutions were {{important}} because Egypt broadcast claims of US aircraft support on June 6. Iraq {{was the first}} country to limit its oil shipments, <b>embargoing</b> the United States and the United Kingdom on June 6. Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, and Bahrain eventually <b>embargoed</b> the United States and the United Kingdom. Syria stopped all oil exports, rather than just <b>embargoing</b> specific countries, {{in order to avoid}} declaring specific nations as aggressors.|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a {{skirmish}} between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839. Located {{in present-day}} Hong Kong, Kowloon was then {{part of the}} Guangdong province. The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales <b>embargo</b> on the British community. The <b>embargo</b> was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift the <b>embargo.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade <b>embargo</b> on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.|$|E

40|$|China’s {{concern over}} its food {{security}} {{has increased in}} recent years as it opens up its domestic food market {{to the rest of the}} world. Chinese policymakers often regard food <b>embargoes</b> by the West as a major potential threat to food security. This paper examines the likelihood and consequences of food <b>embargoes</b> against China. The paper concludes that food <b>embargoes</b> are unlikely to occur, and even if they did, the damage that they could inflict on China is probably small. As a deterrent to such actions, however, international rules governing food <b>embargoes</b> should be strengthened. This will give food-importing countries greater confidence in liberalising trade and will weaken the argument for agricultural protection on the grounds of national security. ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{preamble}} of the resolution, the Council reaffirmed {{the importance of}} the Djibouti Peace Agreement and the Transitional Federal Charter as a basis for a resolution of the conflict in Somalia. It condemned violations of the arms <b>embargoes</b> against Eritrea and Somalia and called upon all states, particularly those in the region, to refrain from violating the <b>embargoes.</b> Council members stressed the need for enhancing the monitoring of the arms <b>embargoes</b> and expressed concern at acts of intimidation against the monitoring group.|$|R

5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade <b>embargo.</b> Also in 1980, the new embassy under construction in Moscow was found to be so riddled with listening devices that it would be unusable for secure work.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil <b>embargo</b> against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous <b>embargo</b> attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the <b>embargo</b> ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

40|$|The North Cyprus {{economy has}} been under {{economic}} <b>embargoes</b> for many years, and has been struggling to eradicate the income difference with {{the south of the}} island with extremely limited facilities. Successive governments have accordingly developed distinctive responses to cope with these difficulties. The paper examines these features of the North Cyprus economy with a particular emphasis on its response to economic <b>embargoes.</b> The paper also examines how important economic <b>embargoes</b> would be (or have been) in the North Cypriot economy. For this purpose total economic growth is decomposed with respect to different components of demand. The results show that despite the presence of <b>embargoes,</b> external demand and the availability of import flows are detrimental factors for economic growth. Also domestic final demand is an equally important source of growth in the North Cyprus economy. ...|$|R
5|$|The 2016–2017 season {{provided}} some much-needed respite for beleaguered BWFC fans, as the club successfully achieved promotion from League One {{at the first}} attempt.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms <b>embargo</b> introduced in September. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war culminating in the Battle of the Barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton.
