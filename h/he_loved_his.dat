5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E

Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort {{because of his}} love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. He fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E

25|$|Joe {{devastated the}} IRA in west Belfast in the mid-1980s. I was told <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> work {{and got a}} great deal of {{pleasure}} after operations were compromised. He was a very willing agent and tried on at least two occasions to entrap senior republicans. But it was probably {{only a matter of time}} before he was caught out and by late 1988 he was under suspicion.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, but because <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E

Pellot showed an {{interest}} in baseball at a young age, however his father didn't want him to play baseball and would punish him if he caught him doing so. When he was 13 years old, his father died and it was only then {{that he was able to}} play the game <b>he</b> <b>loved.</b> <b>His</b> mother moved to the city of Caguas, there he attended and graduated from José Gautier Benítez High School.|$|E
25|$|Charlie, {{a writer}} who's {{been living in}} London for many years, returns to his boyhood home in Dalkey, a suburb of Dublin, Ireland, {{after the death of}} his adoptive father. He finds that the house is filled with ghosts, of his parents and of his younger self. Charlie talks and interacts with all the ghosts, relives {{important}} moments from his youth, and comes to grips with his complicated feelings for his adoptive parents. Through Charlie's conversations and interactions with the ghosts in his home, we see both why <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> parents and why he was so eager to leave them far behind.|$|E
25|$|Stoppard {{left school}} at {{seventeen}} and began {{work as a}} journalist for the Western Daily Press in Bristol, never receiving a university education, having taken against the idea. Years later he came to regret not going to university, {{but at the time}} <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> work as a journalist and felt passionately about his career. He remained at the paper from 1954 until 1958, when the Bristol Evening World offered Stoppard the position of feature writer, humour columnist, and secondary drama critic, which took Stoppard into the world of theatre. At the Bristol Old Vic– at the time a well-regarded regional repertory company– Stoppard formed friendships with director John Boorman and actor Peter O'Toole early in their careers. In Bristol, he became known more for his strained attempts at humour and unstylish clothes than for his writing.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1860, Buford and {{his fellow}} {{soldiers}} had lived with talk of secession {{and the possibility of}} civil war until the Pony Express brought word that Fort Sumter had been fired on in April 1861, confirming secession as fact. As was the case with many West Pointers, Buford had to choose between North and South. Based on his background, Buford had ample reason to join the Confederacy. He was a native Kentuckian, the son of a slave-owning father, and the husband of a woman whose relatives would fight for the South, as would a number of his own. On the other hand, Buford had been educated in the North and come to maturity within the Army. His two most influential professional role models, Colonels William S. Harney and Philip St. George Cooke, were Southerners who elected to remain with the Union and the U.S. Army. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> profession and his time on the frontier had snapped the ties that drew other Southerners home.|$|E
25|$|From {{a man in}} Iowa, Walker heard {{good things}} about Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved there in 1862. He arrived at Saint Paul where he met and sold grindstones, once to James Jerome Hill, then {{employed}} as a clerk who carefully sorted them for the buyer. Within one hour of his arrival in Minneapolis, he {{was hired as a}} chainman to George B. Wright, who was surveying federal pine lands in the north of the state. He became a deputy surveyor within a few days. His application to become assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin had been accepted but <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> new career and turned it down. Walker worked for twelve years on government surveys and on surveys for the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. His work took him away from home for long periods, and it gave him intricate knowledge of what property to buy in northern Minnesota. He began to acquire pine land in 1867, but without capital of his own, he partnered at first with Dr. Levi Butler and Howard W. Mills and later with others.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Grimm's work tied in {{strongly}} to {{his views on}} Germany and its culture. His work with fairy tales and his philological work dealt with German origins. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> people and wished for a united Germany, {{he and his brother}} were vocal proponents of expansionist Pan-Germanism. In the German revolution of 1848, he was given a chance to make these views known when {{he was elected to the}} Frankfurt National Parliament. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office in a large part because of his part in the University of Goettingen's refusal to swear to the king of Hanover expounded upon above. He then went to Frankfurt, where he did not play a big part, but did make some speeches, which tended to stray into the realms of history and philology rather than whatever political question was at hand. Grimm was adamant on one subject, however; he wanted the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of Holstein to be under German control. He talked passionately on this subject, which showed his fierce German nationalism.|$|E

500|$|Although as High Commissioner Constantine {{looked after}} {{his staff and}} was {{respected}} by other diplomats, Howat observes there is limited evidence that he was successful in the post: [...] "In the one area in which he acted positively, he blundered—the Bristol affair. In {{the language of the}} game <b>he</b> <b>loved...</b> <b>his</b> timing was wrong though he was full of good intentions". Howat adds that he did not increase his stature or reputation during his term of office.

500|$|In 1917 {{he began}} his lifelong, {{inspirational}} and unrequited passion for Kamila Stösslová, who neither sought nor rejected his devotion. Janáček pleaded for first-name terms in their correspondence. In 1927 she finally agreed and signed herself [...] "Tvá Kamila" [...] (Your Kamila) in a letter, which Zdenka found. This revelation provoked a furious quarrel between Zdenka and Janáček, though their living arrangements did not change – Janáček seems to have persuaded her to stay. In 1928, the year of his death, Janáček confessed his intention to publicise his feelings for Stösslová. Max Brod had to dissuade him. Janáček's contemporaries and collaborators described him as mistrustful and reserved, but capable of obsessive passion for those <b>he</b> <b>loved.</b> <b>His</b> overwhelming passion for Stösslová was sincere but verged upon self-destruction. Their letters remain an important source for Janáček's artistic intentions and inspiration. His letters to his long-suffering wife are, by contrast, mundanely descriptive. Zdenka seems to have destroyed all hers to Janáček. Only a few postcards survive.|$|E

500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. <b>He</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E
500|$|On 18 May 2011, it was {{announced}} Barber had joined the cast of Neighbours as Rhys Lawson. His casting announcement came as the show lost regular cast member Scott McGregor (Mark Brennan). Barber was appearing in a small guest role in fellow Australian soap opera Home and Away when {{he was given the}} role of Rhys. He began filming his first scenes for Neighbours opposite Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) and Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) the week before his casting announcement. Of appearing in Neighbours, the actor told Matt Neal of The Warrnambool Standard [...] "I catch myself and have a moment where I realise that I'm working with actors I watched on TV growing up. My first scenes were with Alan and Jackie. It was great to have them there to help out and show me how it's done. I was in safe hands."

500|$|Actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan deemed John a [...] "tormented soul," [...] {{motivated}} by an [...] "equal combination of revenge and protecting his sons." [...] Following {{the death of}} their mother, Sam and Dean became secondary to John's quest of killing the demon responsible, although Morgan believed that this aspect changed once John began spending more time with them again. Though he thought that John was not the world's best dad and [...] "definitely made a lot of mistakes," [...] the actor noted that [...] "he did things, even when they were wrong, for the good of his sons." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV felt that this reasoning extended to John's decision to hide the truth from Adam to protect him. Kubicek also suggested that John became involved in Adam's life to achieve [...] "some level of normalcy" [...] as a father, an opportunity he had previously lost following the death of Sam and Dean's mother. Overall, Morgan felt that John [...] "loved those kids more than <b>he</b> <b>loved</b> <b>his</b> own life," [...] with the character's demonic pact with Azazel serving as [...] "his way of finding redemption." ...|$|E
