50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, AHAM {{developed}} {{a method for}} measuring the {{clean air delivery rate}} for portable household <b>electric</b> <b>room</b> air cleaners. The resulting standard became an American National Standard in 1988 and was last revised in 2006. Known as ANSI/AHAM AC-1, it measures the air cleaner's ability to reduce tobacco smoke, dust and pollen particles in a room. It also includes a method for calculating the suggested room size.|$|E
50|$|In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a {{professor}} at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first <b>electric</b> <b>room</b> thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{emergency}} lights, {{emergency lighting}} {{is not a}} type of light fixture; it is a pattern of the building's normal lights that provides a path of lights to allow for safe exit, or lights up service areas such as mechanical <b>rooms</b> and <b>electric</b> <b>rooms.</b> Exit signs, Fire alarm systems (that are not on back up batteries) and the electric motor pumps for the fire sprinklers are almost always on emergency power. Other equipment on emergency power may include smoke isolation dampers, smoke evacuation fans, elevators, handicap doors and outlets in service areas. Hospitals use emergency power outlets to power life support systems and monitoring equipment. Some buildings may even use emergency power as part of normal operations, such as a theater using it to power show equipment because [...] "the show must go on." ...|$|R
