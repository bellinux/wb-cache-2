25|$|The typical way to {{consider}} polarization {{is to keep}} track of the orientation of the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> as the electromagnetic wave propagates. The <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> of a plane wave may be arbitrarily divided into two perpendicular components labeled x and y (with z indicating the direction of travel). The shape traced out in the x-y plane by the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> is a Lissajous figure that describes the polarization state. The following figures show some examples of the evolution of the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> (blue), with time (the vertical axes), at a particular point in space, along with its x and y components (red/left and green/right), and the path traced by the vector in the plane (purple): The same evolution would occur when looking at the electric field at a particular time while evolving the point in space, along the direction opposite to propagation.|$|E

25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>vector</b> and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{superposition}} allows Coulomb's law to {{be extended}} to include any number of point charges.
