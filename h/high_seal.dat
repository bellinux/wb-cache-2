The numerical investigation uses a structured grid method to study the overall {{interaction between the}} turbine stage components and the wheelspace seal flow, and an unstructured grid method to resolve the detailed flow features within the geometrically complex cavity seal. The numerical results agree with various observations from experimental studies under similar flow conditions.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in neurotechnological research rely on planar microelectrode arrays (MEA) but the disadvantage of these systems is the low density of electrodes caused by the problem of wiring {{a great number of}} electrodes. In turn this results in a low number of good cell to electrode contacts. To overcome this drawback, a great number of laterally isolated sub-μm electrodes is placed on a photoconductor layer (amorphous silicon a-Si:H).

40|$|Previous {{analyses}} of high pressure seals have considered adiabatic flow with friction but neglected effects of seal rotation. Most {{of this work}} analyzed a one-dimensional flow field. This works well to calculate stiffness and leakage of full circular seals, either face seals or annular ring seals.

On the other hand, solutions of Reynolds lubrication equation have been obtained for the two-dimensional flow in a seal pad.

40|$|Wear and {{friction}} {{tests were}} conducted on a rotational tribometer to identify material couples for compression seals and chamber coatings to extend the service life of the Pivotal Engine™. Potential materials were identified based on reports {{in the literature of}} successful use in similar environments. From the rotational tribometer tests, the best material couple was found to be reaction bonded silicon nitride against a Sulzer Metco F 4301 plasma sprayed coating followed by a Total Seal TiN coated seal against the F 4301 coating. However, the performance predicted by the rotational tribometer was not realised in a fired engine, where the TiN coated seal wore almost as fast as an uncoated seal. This discrepancy was due to the large differences in operating conditions between the rotational tribometer and the fired engine, particularly the reciprocating motion of the engine. The different operating conditions mean that the results from the rotational tribometer have little or no relevance actual performance in the engine. To overcome the limitations of the rotational tribometer a reciprocating tribometer was designed and built. The performance predicted by the reciprocating tribometer was much closer to the observed wear rates from the engine, particularly with the Total Seal TiN coated seals. Some of the results from the reciprocating tribometer were a direct-contradiction to those obtained on the rotational tribometer. When tested on the rotational tribometer the nitrided stainless steel seal wear rate was lower than that of the Mazda cast iron seal. However, on the reciprocating tribometer the Mazda cast iron seal had a lower wear rate than the nitrided stainless steel seal. From the testing conducted on the reciprocating tribometer the best material couple was found to be Total Seal TiN coated seals on the F 4301 chamber coating. However, this material couple cannot be recommended to increase the seal life in the Pivotal Engine™ because at the conclusion of a twenty hour test the Total Seal TiN coating had worn through to the substrate. In addition to testing different materials, different oils were tested while keeping the wear couple constant. The oil that offered the best wear protection to both the seal and chamber coating was Castrol A 747. These tests showed that different oils have as much effect as different materials. Even with the best material combinations (Total Seal TiN seal, F 4301 chamber coating) the seal wear rates in the Pivotal Engine™ are much higher than would be expected in other engines. This leads to the hypothesis that the origin of <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> wear in the Pivotal Engine™ is not due to material properties, but to design issues. The most likely problem is distortion of the chamber, which causes high localised seal loadings, and in turn causing <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> wear...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of planar bilayer lipid {{membrane}} (BLM) formation is presented that allows stable, solvent-free lipid bilayers exhibiting <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> resistances to be formed rapidly, easily and reproducibly. Using these bilayers the passive permeation {{of a series}} of carboxylic acids is investigated, to determine quantitatively the trend in permeability with lipophilicity of the acid. BLMs are formed at the tip openings of pulled theta pipets, and the rate of permeation of each carboxylic acid across the bilayer, from within the pipet into the bulk solution is determined. This is achieved through spatially-resolved measurements of the pH change that occurs upon the permeation of the weak acid, visualized using a pH-sensitive fluorophore with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The extracted fluorescence profiles are matched to finite element method (FEM) simulations, to allow the associated permeation coefficient for each weak acid to be determined with high accuracy, since this is the only adjustable parameter used to fit the experimental data. For bilayers formed in this way, the weak acids show increasing permeability with lipophilicity. Furthermore, the arrangement allows the effect of a trans-membrane electric field on permeation to be explored. For both propanoic and hexanoic acid it is found that an applied electric field enhances molecular transport, which is attributed to the formation of pores within the membrane...|$|E

Because of its noninvasive nature, the configuration can be used for long term semi intracellular electrophysiological monitoring of APs and synaptic potentials. Three principals converge to generate the IN-CELL configuration: (a) engulfment of approximately one micrometer size gold mushroom-shaped microelectrodes (gM&# 181;E) by the neurons, (b) formation of <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> resistance between the cell’s plasma membrane and the engulfed gM&# 181;E and (c), autonomous localized increased conductance of the membrane patch facing the gM&# 181;E.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of palaeo-oil columns in Late Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs in the Vulcan sub-basin indicates that hydrocarbon accumulations have leaked. It {{is unclear whether}} accumulations have leaked through breach of top seal or fault seal. This study evaluates the top seal potential for hydrocarbon accumulations in the Vulcan Sub-basin. For this purpose a top seal potential assessment methodology was developed. Seal potential (SP) combines seal capacity (the hydrocarbon column height that can physically be held back by seal), seal geometry (the areal extent and thickness of the seal) and seal integrity (rock mechanical properties of the seal). Seal capacities are measured using mercury injection capillary pressure calculations. Areal extent is evaluated using sedimentological and sequence stratigraphic principles. Thickness is determined empirically from well logs and seismic data. Seal integrity is derived from a brittleness index. In addition, a component relating to data quality and quantity is included in seal potential evaluation. The main sample set for this study is composed of drill cuttings. For this reason a comparison of seal capacity results measured from cuttings and cores has verified that cuttings samples provide accurate seal capacity measurements. Lower Vulcan Formation SP ranges from low to high due to variations in seal capacity and thickness risks as well as data quality and quantity. High SP occurs in the main depocentres and low SP occurs on the palaeo-highs and basin margins. Upper Vulcan Formations SP ranges from low to moderate due to variations in seal capacity. Moderate SP occurs in the depocentres and low SP on the basin margins. In the Echuca Shoals Formations seal capacity. Formation seal extent and integrity as well as data quality and quantity are good. However seal thickness is inconsistent, resulting in SP variations from good to poor {{as a function of}} thickness. Jamieson Formation has <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> capacities, is thick and areally extensive, however the seal potential is locally moderate (for example on the Ashmore Platform) due to seal integrity risk. SP for the Jamieson is controlled by the thickness and the amount of calcite present in the rock, which affects the brittleness of the formation and hence the seal integrity. The Woolaston, Gibson and Fenelon (WGF) Formations are grouped together as a regional seal and in this group SP varies from low to high. The WGF rocks generally have <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> capacities, are areally extensive and thick with good data quality and quantity sample set wise. Where the WGF is predominantly marl and calcilutite some of the highest brittleness index values were recorded and hence the WGF has a low SP in these areas. Based on the overall seal potential analysis, almost all seals in the area are capable of holding back hydrocarbon columns greater then present or palaeocolums recorded. This suggests that hydrocarbon leakage in the Vulcan Sub-Basin did not occur as a result of top seal capillary failure. Thesis (Ph. D.)

CRAC currents (ICRAC) are small, and thus precise recordings require high signal-to-noise ratios obtained by <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> resistances. Automated whole-cell establishment resulted in membrane resistances of 1728 ± 226 MΩ (n = 44). CRAC channels were activated {{by a number}} of methods that raise intracellular calcium concentration, including EGTA, ionomycin, Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, and thapsigargin. ICRAC whole-cell currents ranged from 30 to 120 pA with rise times of 40 to 150 s. An initial delay in cur-rent activation was observed in particular when ICRAC was activated by passive store depletion using EGTA. Apparent run-down of ICRAC was commonly observed, and the current could be reactivated by subsequent addition of thapsigargin. ICRAC was blocked by SKF- 96365 and 2 -APB with IC 50 values of 4. 7 ± 1. 1 μM (n = 9) and 7. 5 ± 0. 7 (n = 9) μM, respectively.

30|$|Drilling fluid losses into {{fractured}} shales {{is a major}} challenge. Lost circulation {{treatments are}} widely applied to mitigate the losses; however, {{the effectiveness of these}} treatments is affected by different physical properties of the used lost circulation materials (LCM). This paper presents an experimental investigation to study the effect of LCM type, concentration, particle size distribution, temperature, and LCM shape on the formed seal integrity, with respect to differential pressure, at different fracture widths. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} address the effectiveness of LCM treatments in sealing fractured shales, with specific application to the over consolidated Barents Sea overburden. Three commonly used LCMs that vary in size were used to formulate and evaluate the effectiveness of nine LCM blends. Nutshell blends effectively sealed different fracture widths with <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> integrities. Examination of the formed seal under an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope revealed that this performance is due to the irregular shapes of these materials as well as their ability to deform under elevated pressure. Based on the results, it has been found that to effectively seal fractures using granular LCM treatments, the D 90 value should be equal or slightly larger than the anticipated fracture width. However, due to both the increased risk of plugging downhole tools and the availability of larger LCM, granular LCM treatments can only be used to seal fractures up to 2000  microns. With the current limitations, other unconventional treatments are required to seal fractures wider than 2000  microns.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The spatial {{distribution}} and habitat {{selection of the}} Ladoga ringed seal (Pusa hispida ladogensis), an endangered freshwater seal, are poorly understood, particularly for the ice-covered period. A fixed-wing, strip-transect aerial survey conducted in early April 2012, before the Lake Ladoga breakup, provided data on seal density and distribution throughout the lake in relation to several environmental covariates: depth, distance to shore, recreational ice-fishing activity, and ice type. A predictive model was applied to combinations of covariates to estimate {{the total number of}} seals hauled out on ice of Lake Ladoga. The model estimate was 5068 (95 % CI: 4026 – 7086) seals over an area of 16 827 km 2. The mean observed seal density was 0. 29 seals/km 2 (SD = 0. 351, range from 0 to 8. 61), and density was highest (> 1 seal/km 2) in regions that were relatively shallow (< 50 m). Densities appeared to increase with distance from shore but dropped off again at the longest distances. The average density was lower in fast ice habitats (0. 13 seals/km 2) than in drifting pack ice habitats (0. 44 seals/km 2). Relatively <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> densities observed in “ice edge ” zones (0. 26 seals/km 2) could be explained by the ice formation pattern of large ridged and hummocked areas in the transition zone between shorefast ice and secondary ice. The presence of fishermen had a highly significant negative effect on seal presence (β = − 7. 8, p = 0. 0014), resulting in a nearly twofold decrease in seal density in shorefast ice habitats (0. 09 seals/km 2 in fishing areas and 0. 15 seals/km 2 in areas without fishing activity). An extensive winter recreational fishery, in combination with potential negative trends in ice conditions on the lake, might reduce the amount of suitable habitat for the Ladoga ringed seal in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Proteins {{represent}} {{the most diverse}} class of biomolecules in both structure and function and are involved in nearly every physiological process; their quantification, identification, and biophysical characterization is therefore of fundamental and practical importance. This dissertation introduces two distinct techniques that use nanopores to characterize and identify single unlabeled proteins in a high-throughput manner. The first technique uses femtosecond-laser-fabricated dual-pore glass chips for performing cell-attached single-ion-channel recordings. Existing planar patch-clamp platforms are generally unable to perform these types of recordings due to excess noise arising from low seal resistances {{and the use of}} substrates with poor dielectric properties. While these platforms tend to use a single pore (D ~ 1 – 2 μm) to position a cell by suction and to establish a seal, the dual-pore glass chips employ separate pores optimized for each function, enabling the use of a relatively small patch aperture (D ~ 150 – 300 nm) that is more suitable for forming high-resistance seals than micropores used currently. Patch-clamp experiments with these chips achieved <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> resistances and the lowest RMS noise ever reported for a planar patch-clamp platform. This platform enables semi-automated single-channel recordings in the cell-attached configuration that are comparable to those obtained by conventional patch-clamp, which is laborious and requires manual control of micropipette position. The second technique uses electrolyte-filled nanopores coated with a lipid bilayer to characterize single lipid-anchored proteins via resistive-pulse sensing. Lipid-coated nanopores have previously been used to determine a protein’s volume, charge, and ligand affinity by measuring the change in ionic current, DI, through the nanopore as a protein travels {{from one side to the}} other. Exploiting the dependence of DI on the shape and orientation of a particle in the nanopore, this work extends the capabilities of resistive-pulse sensors by enabling determination of the shape, volume, rotational diffusion coefficient, and dipole moment of individual non-spherical proteins. The techniques introduced here may ultimately reveal insights into conformational protein dynamics, expedite biomarker and drug discovery, enable the characterization of personal proteomes, and improve our understanding of proteins and protein complexes regarding health and disease...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying the {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} sandeels in grey seal foraging areas will provide an improved understanding of habitat use of grey seals on the West Coast of Scotland. The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, is a key food for many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest single-species fishery in the North Sea (Furness, 2002). Fisheries acoustic data were collected during 2 cruises in May 2004 and July 2004 around the Inner Hebrides, West Scotland. A fully calibrated EK 500 echosounder was used, operating at two frequencies (38 kHz and 120 kHz). The collected data was processed using SonarData Echoview software. Acoustic identification of sandeels was established by using a dB difference algorithm (?MVBS = MVBS 38 - MVBS 120; where ?MVBS < - 1 indicated sandeels). The resulting Nautical Area Backscattering Coefficient (NASC) was integrated for each 0. 5 nmi interval and converted to a relative estimate of mean sandeel density in seal foraging areas. Information on the spatial distribution and movements of 34 grey seals around the West Coast of Scotland in 2003 and 2004 have been collected by SMRU using Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SDRL) and will be used to compare sandeel densities and distribution in areas of <b>high</b> <b>seal</b> usage. The results indicated that the distribution of sandeels was extremely patchy along transects and the cruise track. A comparison of the relative abundance of sandeels in foraging areas showed that densities vary extremely between these areas. Highest densities of sandeels were recorded East of Tiree on the 14 th of May and in Stanton Banks on the 17 th of July. Future research will involve establishing a correlation between seal usage of foraging areas and sandeel abundance and distribution. In addition, the analysis of other fish species and zooplankton in these areas will contribute to a further understanding of foraging strategies of grey seals. The capabilities of underwater acoustic research and their implementation in ecosystem-based studies are constantly evolving. Interdisciplinary research should be encouraged in order to provide useful insights in ecosystem dynamics but also to benefit fisheries and conservation management strategies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine how process settings and crimp geometry affect the seal strength and integrity of traditional polyolefin and biopolymer flexible packaging materials. The results show agreement with previous studies where temperature and dwell time are found to be the dominant factors for both polyolefin and biopolymer films. Pressure and crimp geometry are shown to be secondary factors in the process, up to the point of squeezing the film into molecular contact. In general it is shown that biopolymers exhibit similar sealing characteristics to more traditional films. In respect of the sealing crimp geometry it is shown that the crimp pitch has little or no effect on sealing integrity for films with gauges between 25 µm and 40 µm.
