5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E

It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Naila, the wife of Uthman, threw herself on his body to protect him and raised her hand to deflect a sword. She had her fingers chopped off and was pushed aside. The next blow killed Uthman. Some of Uthman's slaves counter-attacked, one of whom killed the assassin and was in turn killed by the rebels.|$|E

During a press conference following the semi-final, Mukuchyan responded to the incident by stating that [...] "You don't have to forget that I am representing my country in my heart, my thoughts, my feelings, and all my emotions.

Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (Moralistic judgments are {{not to be confused with}} value judgments as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of oneself. This way of speaking is said to have the result that [...] "Our attention is focused on classifying, analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and others need and are not getting." ...|$|E

500|$|Brad Wheeler, {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{wondered}} if the eponymous title was an allusion to the Atlantic Records contractual dispute. He went on to remark on the music's combination of 90s era [...] "guitar flash and crunch" [...] and The Beatles. Wheeler did not think the album moved the band or its sound forward, calling it [...] "a quasi-comeback album that neither defiles nor builds upon the band's legend." [...] Amirose Eisenbach of IGN wrote that the music was not [...] "anything especially unique". Eisenbach analyzed several tracks, observing that some songs [...] "start off promising" [...] only to result in [...] "uninspired, generic hooks," [...] while other songs struggle with their musical direction. Despite this, Eisenbach felt the album had [...] "enough <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the album's 41 minutes that it's worth a listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspector Lomax then initiates a manhunt for {{the missing}} Carroon. After hiding out on a river barge, Carroon {{encounters}} a little girl, leaving her also unharmed through sheer force of willpower. Then, Carroon proceeds to a nearby pharmacy and kills the chemist, using his now-swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted empty husk of the man to be found by police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has used select chemicals taken from the shelves to [...] "speed up a change <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of him". That night finds Carroon at a zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, twisted corpses of zoo animals are found, their life forces having all been absorbed, and a trail of slime leading {{back out into the}} community. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant of what was once Victor Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. From his examination of this remnant, Quatermass concludes that some kind of alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet ...|$|E

On the 2009 deluxe edition the track finishes at 5:48 as well, but the reprise already kicks back in at 5:57, making the track 5:22 shorter.|$|R

[...] On 31 October 2012, Blackburn Rovers announced that Berg had accepted an offer for a three-year contract to manage the club. He became Blackburn's first foreign manager. Berg said of his previous comments about the club's owners, Venky's: [...] "That was me {{looking at it from}} the outside without knowing really what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in the <b>inside.</b> I think this club at the moment is going in the right direction." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{this way}} we repair the major damage wrought by mentalism.

For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis {{of the role of}} the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.|$|E
2500|$|Blaming {{herself for}} the album's {{commercial}} results, Norwood dismissed the album as [...] "too pop." [...] With her team wanting to produce a crossover album, Norwood had felt pressured {{to come up with}} different songs. Commenting on this decision, she later elaborated: [...] "I was listening to the voice of my team more so than what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> of me. With Human, I felt like I wanted to do more R music and that’s not what we decided to do on that album." [...] The debut season of her 2010 VH1 reality series [...] further revealed that the album's underperformance resulted in another argument between her and executive producer Rodney Jerkins, whose commitment to the project Norwood felt not as [...] "creative and forthcoming" [...] as on previous albums and that he purposefully did not put his best work in the album. Jerkins had distanced himself from the project following its official release, declaring his dissatisfaction with the involvement of other producers on the album.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion of the {{literary}} genre includes whether what is represented is a history, a parable, a myth, or compound of various genres. This relates {{to the reality of}} the encounter. Sometimes the temptation narrative is taken as a parable, reading that Jesus in his ministry told this narrative to audiences relating his inner experience {{in the form of a}} parable. Or it is autobiographical, regarding what sort of Messiah Jesus intended to be. Writers including William Barclay have pointed to the fact that there is [...] "no mountain high enough in all the world to see the whole world" [...] as indication of the non-literal nature of the event, and that the narrative portrays what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> Jesus' mind. Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas explained, [...] "In regard to the words, 'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate." ...|$|E

5000|$|The racecourse {{was found}} 2 {{miles south of}} Woore village in the hamlet of Pipe Gate, on {{farmland}} owned by Mr Icke and leased to the racecourse company. The track was a mile round, with very sharp left hand bends. Horses had to gallop over {{a bridge between the}} last two jumps. As the course was constantly turning, it paid to be close to the rails. According to former jockey, Bernard Wells, it felt [...] "as though you were <b>going</b> round <b>on</b> the <b>inside</b> of a saucepan." [...] Since the course was also used for grazing, it was regularly covered with cow pats, an unpleasant experience for the jockeys who would be covered by it; low-hanging branches also made riding difficult for jockeys.|$|R
2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene {{that looked as if}} it would make a good cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{reason is}} that it puts the {{entities}} about which we require knowledge behind a [...] "veil of perception", an occult field of [...] "appearance" [...] which leaves us ignorant of the reality presumed to be beyond it. He is convinced that such uncertainty propels into the dangerous regions of relativism and solipsism: relativism sees all truth {{as determined by the}} single observer; solipsism, in which the single observer is the only creator of and legislator for his or her own universe, carries the assumption that no one else exists. These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being something going on in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for {{the fact that in the}} 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>inside</b> the head. The argument was usually strengthened with mockery at the very idea of [...] "redness" [...] being in the brain: the question was—and still is—"How can there be red neurons in the brain?" [...] which strikes one as a justifiable appeal to common sense.|$|E
30|$|There was a sannyāsī. He {{was very}} famous. He {{was sitting with}} his devotees (bhakts) and talking to them. The news came over there that his wife expired. You know what he said? He said, “It’s great. Now I am out of problems.” It {{affected}} the people. The devotees said, “Oh, what a big sannyāsī he is!” The sannyāsī said, “She died and now I have no more problems behind me.” But he should have considered this: You’re a sannyāsī, you’ve been a sannyāsī for {{the last twenty years}} and still she’s a “problem” for you? She’s still in your mind and heart as a “problem” after all these years? Normally, whenever we (sādhus) hear of anyone’s death, we say that the soul should find peace (śānti) and it should leave the body in a good way (acci tarah se). But if all these things are coming into your mind when someone dies, it means you are still attached to that person. It means something is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> from <b>inside.</b> You might not be attached in one way, but definitely, you’re attached. You’re attached either in rāg or dveś. You are connected with these two things in some way. But when the sannyāsī is balanced, rāg and dveś have disappeared. His love for the world has become bigger, not smaller.|$|R
