The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a double-decker bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge and gate through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E

2500|$|Veins do {{not develop}} atheromata, {{because they are}} not {{subjected}} to the same hemodynamic pressure that arteries are, unless surgically moved to function as an artery, as <b>in</b> <b>bypass</b> surgery. The accumulation (swelling) is always in the tunica intima, between the endothelium lining and the smooth muscle middle layer of the artery wall. While the early stages, based on gross appearance, have traditionally been termed fatty streaks by pathologists, they are not composed of fat cells but of accumulations of white blood cells, especially macrophages, that have taken up oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). [...] After they accumulate large amounts of cytoplasmic membranes (with associated high cholesterol content) they are called foam cells. [...] When foam cells die, their contents are released, which attracts more macrophages and creates an extracellular lipid core near the center to inner surface of each atherosclerotic plaque. Conversely, the outer, older portions of the plaque become more calcified, less metabolically active and more physically stiff over time.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Inactivity of the gut {{leads to}} atrophic changes of which little is known.  AIMS—To {{investigate}} structural, neuronal, and functional changes occurring <b>in</b> <b>bypassed</b> rat ileum.  METHODS—Morphometry {{was used to}} characterise the atrophic changes. The numbers of enteric neurones, their expression of neurotransmitters, {{and the presence of}} interstitial cells of Cajal were studied using immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridisation. Motor activity was studied in vitro.  RESULTS—Adaptive changes <b>in</b> <b>bypassed</b> ileum include atrophy and remodelling of the gut wall. The total numbers of submucous and myenteric neurones per unit length increased one and four weeks after bypass but were identical to sham operated intestine 10  weeks after bypass. Neurones expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide Y, or pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide decreased gradually <b>in</b> number <b>in</b> <b>bypassed</b> ileum. Nitric oxide synthase expressing neurones were increased, particularly in the myenteric ganglia. No change in the frequency and distribution of interstitial cells of Cajal was noted. The contractile response elicited by electrical stimulation of sham operated ileum consisted of a fast cholinergic twitch followed by a slower non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic contraction. <b>In</b> the <b>bypassed</b> ileum an identical biphasic contraction was elicited; however, the entire response was non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic. The relaxatory response to electrical stimulation in sham operated ileum was nitric oxide mediated; after bypass it was non-nitrergic.  CONCLUSIONS—Notable atrophic changes were seen in the rat ileum after bypass. The enteric nervous system reacted with neuronal cell death and plasticity in terms of release and expression of neurotransmitters.    Keywords: neuronal plasticity; enteric nerves; interstitial cells of Cajal; atrophy; neuropeptides; nitric oxid...|$|R
