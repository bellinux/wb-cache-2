5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> replace it with an ox, and when the ox stopped, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assume {{full command}} {{as soon as}} the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month of}} preparation, just before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had {{withdrawn}} up the Peninsula towards Williamsburg. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of Yorktown. The Battle of Williamsburg on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan's first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of their troops were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond's outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.|$|E

And while <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> recognise the practical utility of the supernatural, in an educational point of view, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not himself <b>to</b> indulge in such intellectual beating of the air as to admit the possibility of the violation of inviolable laws, or to argue in a sphere wherein argument is A PRIORI annihilated. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free from all bias towards friend and country; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> courteous and gentle in criticism; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not <b>to</b> regard history as a mere opportunity for splendid and tragic writing; nor <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> falsify truth {{for the sake of a}} paradox or an epigram.|$|R

5|$|After leaving school, Macartney {{worked for}} a fruit and {{vegetable}} merchant near Sydney's Sussex Street docks, honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break. At this stage in his career, he possessed a copybook technique and defensive style, something <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> discard for an audacious, self-styled and attacking outlook.|$|E
5|$|Against Osasuna on 17 September 2011, Villa contributed {{two goals}} and forced Rovérsio into scoring an own goal in Barcelona's 8–0 {{win over the}} team from Pamplona. He then broke his tibia in a Club World Cup match in Yokohama against Al Sadd. Doctors said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be out of action {{for up to six}} months, but this {{eventually}} led to him missing the entire 2011–12 season with both Barcelona and the Spanish football team at Euro 2012.|$|E
5|$|Around 1671, Anne {{first made}} the {{acquaintance}} of Sarah Jennings, {{who later became}} her close friend {{and one of her}} most influential advisors. Jennings married John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough) in about 1678. His sister, Arabella Churchill, was the Duke of York's mistress, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be Anne's most important general.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|Beaufort {{developed}} the Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use in his journals {{for the remainder}} of his life.

5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> labour.|$|E

5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April.

All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E

He formally began his term as Senator the next day. His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in.|$|E

5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team.
