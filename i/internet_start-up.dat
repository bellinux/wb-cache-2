5|$|Students at Hastings Boys' High School {{organised}} {{a conference}} in 1999 to consider cloning the huia, their school emblem. The tribe Ngāti Huia agreed in principle to support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the University of Otago, and a California-based <b>Internet</b> <b>start-up</b> volunteered $100,000 of funding. However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, said that the complete huia genome could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the DNA, and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.|$|E
25|$|Wonga {{was founded}} by Errol Damelin (chief {{executive}} officer) in October 2006 and he linked up with software engineer Jonty Hurwitz in January 2007. Both Damelin and Hurwitz had previous <b>internet</b> <b>start-up</b> experience; neither had any experience of retail banking. When the company first started looking for funding, potential investors saw the short-term, small-loans business as an unprofitable, risky backwater. After being denied funding by UK banks, Wonga secured venture capital through Balderton Capital. The first place of business was in a shared office space in St. John's Wood, London. After a year of software development a beta website was launched in 2007. In interviews, Damelin {{has said that the}} goal was to disrupt the short-term credit industry by providing transparency, exact control of amount and payment date, immediate access to funds, and no faxing or emailing documents. The business model of lending only to those who could pay back reliably, as opposed to the much wider catchment practice of payday loans required an algorithm that could fully determine risk in an automated manner – something they had difficulty developing in the early stages. To get funds directly to customer's bank accounts as quickly as possible, co-operation from leading banks was required. Banks were reportedly dismissive of Wonga's plan saying they would not be totally satisfied with customer identity without physical documentation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some {{phenomena in}} the corporate finance of <b>internet</b> <b>start-ups</b> that emerged during the ?internet buble? between 1998 - 2000. The advent of nternet start-ups had {{a major impact on}} the investment flow and the operations of the venture capital industry in the US and in Europe. It is argued that some of these transformations could be explained by the potential for specific agency conflicts in the financing of <b>internet</b> <b>start-ups.</b> The paper then turns to a discussion of initial public offerings and the listing of companies without near-term profitability, the capital structure of start-ups characterized by the dominance of equity, and the absence of dividend pay-outs. Finally, the valuation of companies and innovative techniques that supposedly can overcome obstacles in the accurate valuation of <b>internet</b> <b>start-ups</b> are discussed.
