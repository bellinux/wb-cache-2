5|$|In 1934, {{having been}} reappointed to a {{position}} on the selection panel, Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series. After agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used, the tour went ahead. However, there were occasions when the Australians <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
50|$|Reasons for loss: The execuitves <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> while <b>their</b> soy {{ginger and}} orange chicken meal tasted good, the frozen yogurt dessert was too complex to be {{packaged}} as a frozen food.|$|R
30|$|Over-all the {{response}} was encouraging. Some <b>felt</b> reassured <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children will now get quality education through the AWCs, and others promised to become more actively involved in with their local AWCs.|$|R
60|$|Then {{they fell}} silent, and Terence and Rachel <b>felt</b> instinctively <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{happiness}} {{had made her}} sad, and, while they were anxious to go on talking about themselves, they did not like to.|$|R
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E
5|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is {{the tenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} November 9, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album, but later <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> collaboration was not going in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna {{spent most of her}} time during the recordings.|$|E
5|$|Hastings <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison {{about his}} contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister {{he could be}} relied on to tell the truth. The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts.|$|E
60|$|A {{few more}} remarks {{were made by}} several of those who stood on the quarter-deck, {{suggesting}} a treatment of the Esquimaux which was not of the gentlest nature, for they <b>felt</b> indignant <b>that</b> <b>their</b> hospitality had been abused.|$|R

60|$|Draconmeyer's {{eyes were}} still fixed upon Hunterleys' slim, self-possessed figure. His {{forehead}} was contorted into a frown. Somehow or other, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> during <b>their</b> brief interview {{he had failed to}} score; he had felt a subtle, underlying note of contempt in Hunterleys' manner, in his whole attitude.|$|R
5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements {{were put in place}} so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} {{a number of}} nominations and awards at Bollywood award shows. The film has been praised for its direction, cinematography and chemistry between the lead actors, with Shahrukh Khan and Anushka Sharma receiving accolades for their performances; however, its script and predictable plot have been criticised. The film won four Filmfare Awards, five Zee Cine Awards and two Colors Screen Awards. Jab Tak Hai Jaan received several marketing and business awards for its overseas performance, promotions, distribution, and music. However, Sharma and Kaif were nominated for Golden Kela and Ghanta awards; some critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> acting was less than stellar. Anushka Sharma and Shreya Ghoshal were the main recipients who were given awards.|$|E
5|$|Revelation is {{the ninth}} studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day, {{released}} on July 29, 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Howard Benson, who had decided {{to work with the}} band after rock singer Chris Daughtry drew attention to lead singer Mac Powell's vocal ability. Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson, Third Day achieved a positive working relationship with Benson, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record.|$|E

60|$|Tommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was {{settling}} {{on him like}} a leaden weight. He <b>felt</b> convinced <b>that</b> <b>their</b> quest {{was going to be}} unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours' start. Three hours was more than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of the telegram having been found.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Earth {{is going}} to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle-doves to each other. Their little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was <b>their</b> duty to take a romantic view of the situation.|$|R
5|$|The NSPCC {{reported}} that the Savile scandal had resulted {{in an increase in}} overall reports of sexual abuse by 81%. This was measured by comparing the years immediately before and after broadcasting of the Exposure documentary. A subsequent NSPCC report was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and published in January 2014. It reported on interviews with 26 individuals, a number of whom were abused in hospitals. Upon reporting abuse to staff at the time, they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> concerns were not treated sincerely.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|SASO decided after {{a debate}} to remain non-affiliated with NUSAS, but would {{nevertheless}} recognise the larger organisation {{as the national}} student body. One of SASO's founding resolutions was to send a representative to each NUSAS conference. In 1970 SASO withdrew its recognition of NUSAS, accusing it of attempting to hinder SASO's growth on various campuses. SASO's split from NUSAS was a traumatic experience for many white liberal youth who had committed themselves {{to the idea of}} a multi-racial organisation and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> attempts were being rebuffed. The NUSAS leadership regretted the split, but largely refrained from criticising SASO. The government—which regarded multi-racial liberalism as a threat and had banned multi-racial political parties in 1968—was pleased with SASO's emergence, regarding it as a victory of apartheid thinking.|$|E
5000|$|Scarymother <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> for <b>their</b> {{first album}} Tai Laeo (Thai for [...] "Already Dead") {{they wanted a}} greater role and freedom in production, as well as better drum sounds. Dorian West had become good friends with producer-{{engineer}} Rick Will [...] after working with him in L.A. Will was chosen to produce and engineer their first album, recorded at studios 301, Charring Cross, and mixed at Metropolis in Melbourne.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{multitude}} <b>felt</b> now <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{enemy was}} delivered into their hands. Was it not in Bethoron that Joshua had defeated the Canaanites, while the sun stayed his course? Was it not here that Judas, the Maccabean, had routed {{the host of}} Nicanor? As soon as the Romans entered the defile, the Jews rushed down upon them, sure of their prey.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{this and}} other, as successful, attacks upon their stockades, the Burmese troops now <b>felt</b> {{confident}} <b>that,</b> with <b>their</b> numerous forces, {{they would be}} victorious whenever the astrologers decided that the favourable moment had arrived.|$|R
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of McKinley's {{election}} in 1896, African Americans were hopeful of progress towards equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. However, African Americans in northern states <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{conducted}} by the AAUW in 2011, of 7th to 12th grade students, only 12% of the surveyed students <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> school did enough to address sexual harassment.|$|E
50|$|Karl Abraham {{differentiated}} {{two types}} of adult women in whom penis envy remained intense as the wish-fulfilling and the vindictive types: The former were dominated by fantasies of having or becoming a penis—as with the singing/dancing/performing women who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>their</b> acts they magically incorporated the parental phallus. The latter sought revenge on the male through humiliation or deprivation (whether by removing {{the man from the}} penis or the penis from the man).|$|R
50|$|Schrunk {{was elected}} mayor with Teamsters union support, {{allegedly}} {{in part because}} the incumbent Republican mayor, Fred Peterson, offended the union when he wouldn't oust Police chief J. Bardell Purcell. The Teamsters <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Purcell impeded <b>their</b> drive to open a wider vice business in Portland.|$|R
5000|$|Her remark sparked outrage amongst many Cebuanos, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Díaz insulted <b>their</b> English proficiency.

In response to the controversy, Díaz saw no need to apologize and instead clarified her remarks: ...|$|R
25|$|The KPE {{was founded}} on February 15, 1976. Its {{founding}} members had left the Deutsche Pfadfinderschaft Sankt Georg because they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> ideas about Scouting and spirituality had been disregarded in the reforms of the 1960s and 1970s. Andreas Hönisch, late Superior General of the SJM, and Günther Walter were both instrumental in the KPE's founding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the decade several class-action {{lawsuits}} were filed against John Roth and others, by former employees who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> 401K company plans were depleted due to misrepresentation by the defendants. They claimed they were duped into investing in Nortel stock, when those who encouraged them to do so allegedly knew that the company was ailing. John Roth left Nortel in 2001 with more than $130 million.|$|E
25|$|One of MSUG's {{proposals}} {{with positive}} results {{was the idea}} of decentralized bureaucracy for COMIGAL. By scattering small offices throughout the villages, COMIGAL was able to improve the responsiveness of those offices; funding for infrastructure projects was generally approved by Saigon in less than two weeks. Decentralization also enabled the offices to work directly with local leaders, who as a result <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> input and participation were important.|$|E
5000|$|The {{participants}} {{soon found}} substantial difficulties in formulating and reaching agreement on their fundamental propositions.

60|$|An hour later, {{the steamer}} started. The river was still full, {{and the current}} rapid, {{and they did not}} move more than five miles an hour against it. At the villages they passed, the people flocked down to the banks, with cries of welcome and the waving of flags. They <b>felt,</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{deliverance}} was accomplished, and that they were free from the tyranny that had, for so many years, oppressed them.|$|R
500|$|... 1997 {{also saw}} lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, {{prompting}} {{speculation about the}} band's survival; McCrea noted that [...] "Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and I really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it (<b>their</b> departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world", {{and said that he}} had considered dissolving the band. Brown and Damiani formed the [...] "new-wave influenced" [...] Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.|$|R
