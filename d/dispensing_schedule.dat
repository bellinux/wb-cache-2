40|$|A {{new service}} {{delivery}} {{system for the}} treatment of opioid dependence, called motivational stepped care, matches the intensity of counseling services to each patient’s clinical progress. Adherence to a counseling schedule is reinforced through the linking of counseling attendance with the patient’s methadone <b>dispensing</b> <b>schedule</b> and, ultimately, his or her ability to continue receiving treatment services. The article describes the scientific evidence supporting the major elements of the model, the model in action, and evaluations that have been conducted to date. The effectiveness of methadone treatment in reducing use of heroin and other opioids has been confirmed in studies spanning more than three decades (Hubbard et al., 1989; Simpson and Sells, 1990) but has declined in recent years. One factor in this development is greater scope and severity of problems among current patients than among their counterparts in the mid- 1960 s. The changing clinical profile includes high rates of use of cocaine and othe...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{adherence}} is {{a significant}} barrier to achieve better patient outcomes. Rates of non-adherence approach 40 % resulting in 10 % of all emergency department visits and 23 % of admissions into skilled nursing facilities. Many factors contribute to medication non-adherence including psychological and memory disorders, aging and pill burden. The MedaCube is a medication management system intended to help solve unintentional medication non-adherence. The device is designed to <b>dispense</b> <b>scheduled</b> and as-needed oral medications. The MedaCube provides audio and visual prompts alerting subjects to administer their medications. Caregivers receive notification of missed doses, late doses and refill requests. The null hypothesis is that use of the MedaCube results in no difference in medication adherence when compared with six month prior adherence in individual subjects...|$|R

40|$|Background: Opioid {{dependence}} treatment traditionally involves methadone clinics, {{for which}} <b>dispensing</b> <b>schedules</b> can be cumbersome. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the mu receptor and antagonist of the kappa receptor, {{is a potential}} outpatient alternative to methadone. Funded {{by a grant from}} the State of Maryland's Community Health Resources Commission (CHRC), the Buprenorphine Outpatient Outcomes Project (BOOP) evaluates the outcome of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) treatment on abstinence from heroin use, rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, legal issues, and quality of life. Methods: Active heroin users were recruited between June 2007 and June 2010 and induction therapy with Suboxone was instituted during hospitalization. Once discharged, patients were followed as outpatients for maintenance treatment and counseling. Data were collected from electronic medical records, Maryland state legal records, and SF- 36 ® Health Surveys regarding several parameters and patients were categorized according to duration of treatment with Suboxone into one of three groups: 3 months. Results: A total of 220 participants were included in the study. The age range of participants was 18 – 67 years with most being African American males. Eighty-three (38 %) remained in the study for at least 1 month, with 37 of the 83 (45 %) remaining in treatment for > 3 months. Ten of the 37 (27 %) never relapsed after their longest period of abstinence from heroin. During the first year after initiating treatment with Suboxone, hospitalization and emergency room visit rates for all 220 participants decreased by 45 and 23 %, respectively, as compared to the year prior to starting treatment. The number of legal charges for drug possession decreased from 70 to 62. Anecdotally, the quality of life seemed to improve in those who were treated with Suboxone for longer periods of time and received regular counseling. Conclusion: Overall, Suboxone is an effective treatment method for heroin addiction and is a viable outpatient therapy option. Individualized treatment plans and counseling must be implemented for maximum benefits to be seen. Retention of patients for a long duration of therapy was difficult, but for those who did remain, benefits were seen in overall health, abstinence from heroin use, cognition, and quality of life...|$|R
50|$|In Canada MBZP remains {{unscheduled}} and uncontrolled as of January, 2015. It is {{not approved}} for any medical use but is legally {{available as a}} research chemical. MBZP is chemically {{closely related to the}} controlled Schedule III substance BZP but the latter's scheduling status shields most of its close derivatives from mandatory analogue laws which in Canada apply only to substances belonging to Schedule I under CDSA regulations, which comprises both explicitly illegal substances as well as legal drugs with the highest potential for abuse and dependence, most of which are listed as US Schedule II in the United States. Unlike the US however, stimulants widely used in the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy in Canada are classified under Schedule III to avoid impractical administrative complications applied to the <b>dispensing</b> of <b>Schedule</b> I substances, a situation which could prompt some practitioners to abstain from dispensing the most proper treatment in order to avoid legal harassment and time-consuming record-keeping not directly related to patient care. BZP, whose abuse profile compared with ADHD treatment drugs is not documented enough to establish any correlation, nonetheless lacks the potency to qualify for Schedule I but was deemed a serious enough concern for control under Schedule III, allowing Health Canada to suspend its sale, but not that of its less potent derivatives, pending further assessment. MBZP remains uncontrolled in Canada as of 2015.|$|R
40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess Florida physicians 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and knowledge toward accessing the state 2 ̆ 7 s prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). Background. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s PDMP collects and stores controlled substance prescribing and <b>dispensing</b> information for <b>schedules</b> II-IV. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s PDMP is currently operational; however, physicians are not required to access the program prior to prescribing controlled substances. Methods. Five thousand medical doctors and osteopathic physicians licensed in Florida were randomly selected for a voluntary and anonymous 15 question self-administered survey approved by the Institutional Review Board. Surveys were distributed through U. S. postal service mail. Likert-scale questions were used to assess prior knowledge (1 =none to 5 =excellent) and attitudes toward accessing the PDMP (1 =strongly disagree to 5 =strongly agree). Results. The study yielded a response rate of 7. 8...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} and discusses findings on a physician Waiver program {{established by the}} Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (“DATA”), which allows qualified physicians to <b>dispense</b> or prescribe <b>Schedule</b> III, IV, and V narcotic medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detoxification and maintenance treatment. Buprenorphine, {{the first and only}} medication eligible for use under the DATA Waiver program, was approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of opioid dependence † on October 8, 2002, and became available early in 2003. This Determinations Report summarizes key findings and recommendations from a 3 year, national SAMHSA evaluation conducted from 2002 through November 2005, as well as an additional literature review commissioned to ascertain consistency of the evaluation’s findings with more recent literature. The evaluation was also useful in identifying and validating special issues emerging from implementation of the DATA program, which this report also discusses.

40|$|A bioterrorist attack, {{or natural}} disaster, would prompt an {{immediate}} government response {{in order to}} efficiently address the possible health effects of the population. Such a scenario would create a logistics problem of delivering medication (or other supplies) to makeshift dispensing centers {{in a short period}} of time and in high quantities while operating. These makeshift centers, or Points of <b>Dispensing,</b> require <b>schedules</b> of delivery that are robust against uncertainty. This inventory slack routing problem is a novel vehicle routing problem. The objective function is to maximize the slack in the schedule. This thesis presents heuristic approaches that separate the problem into routing and scheduling. The routing problem is solved using a route first-cluster second method. The scheduling problem is solved using a heuristic and an improvement approach. This thesis also presents a search approach that uses heuristics to search various neighborhoods in the solution space. These heuristics are chosen randomly based on probabilities that adapt during the search according to their performance. The inventory slack routing problem is also formulated as a mixed-integer program and solved using a column generation procedure that utilizes simulated annealing to generate new vehicle schedules. This thesis presents the results of testing these three approaches on a set of 432 instances that were generated from real-world data to evaluate solution quality and computational effort. The search approach outperformed the heuristic approach with a reasonable amount of computational effort. The column generation approach did not generate desirable vehicle schedules and therefore was not productive in solving the problem...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the problem of uncertainty handling during learning, by agents dealing in stochastic environments by means of Multi Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL). Most previous investigations into multi objective reinforcement learning have proposed algorithms to deal with the learning performance issues but have neglected the uncertainty present in stochastic environments. The realisation that multiple long term objectives are exhibited in many risky and uncertain real-world decision making problems forms the principle motivation of this research. This dissertation proposes a novel modification to the single objective GPFRL algorithm (Hinojosa et al, 2008) where, the implementation of a linear scalarisation methodology provides a way to automatically find an optimal policy for multiple objectives under different kinds of uncertainty. The proposed Generalised Probabilistic Fuzzy Multi Objective Reinforcement Learning (GPFMORL) algorithm is further enhanced by the introduction of prospect theory to guarantee convergence by the means of risk evaluation. The simulated grid world increased in complexity as a further two complementary and conflicting objectives were specified whilst also introducing uncertainty in the form of stochastic cross winds. Results obtained from the GPFMORL grid world simulations were compared against two more classical multi objective algorithms, MOQ and MOSARSA, showing not only a stronger convergence but also a much faster one. Experiments performed on an actual Quad-Copter/Drone demonstrated that the proposed algorithm and developed framework are both feasible and promising for the control of Artificially Intelligent (AI) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in a variety of real-world multi objective applications such as; autonomous landing/delivery or search and rescue. Furthermore, the observed results of this work showed that the GPFMORL method can find its major real world application in the un-calibrated control of non-linear, multiple inputs, and multiple output systems, especially in multi objective situations with high uncertainty. Proposed novel case study research prototype examples include: Controlled Environment Agriculture for optimising Hydroponic Crop Growth by the proposed “Automated Solar Powered Environmental Controller” (ASPEC). Finally the “Robotic Dementia Medication Administration System” (RDMAS) attempts to optimise liquid medication <b>dispensing</b> via intelligent <b>scheduling</b> to more appropriate times of the day when the patient is more likely to remember to take their medication, based upon previous learned knowledge and experience...|$|R
