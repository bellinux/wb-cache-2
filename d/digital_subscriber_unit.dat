50|$|A {{symmetric}} <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (SDSL) is a <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) that transmits {{digital data}} over the copper wires {{of the telephone}} network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth.

DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line. This is possible because DSL uses higher frequency bands for data. On the customer premises, a DSL filter on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.|$|R

In this paper, the conventional 2 -D CAP system is expanded to a 3 -D space.

The 3 -D signaling is obtained through a minimax optimization process to match the characteristics of the original 2 -D system and to achieve perfect reconstruction (PR) condition.

HDSL was developed to transport DS1 services at 1.544 Mbit/s and 2.048 Mbit/s over telephone local loops without a need for repeaters.

In telecommunications marketing, the term <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line is widely understood to mean Asymmetric <b>Digital</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Line (ADSL), {{the most commonly}} installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256 kbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric. With a symmetric <b>digital</b> <b>subscriber</b> line (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.|$|R
