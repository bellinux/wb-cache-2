5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, Soviet {{citizens}} endured the brunt of two world wars, two revolutions (1905 & 1917), a devastating Civil War, and a number of famines. In addition, there was some severe political repression, notably the Great Purge in the 1930s, which led to many people being sent to the Gulag. It <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> under such circumstances, a team sport such as rugby could not flourish and was low on the list of people's priorities. Only with the less repressive regime of the post-Stalin period did Soviet rugby begin to establish a firm base.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} was the growth of urban centers, {{the vast majority of}} which were Muslim. Cities that were founded at the time, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, grew rapidly with a specifically Islamic character and advanced living standards. It <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> many Christians in the outlying rural regions would convert to Islam {{to be part of the}} superior conditions in such places. Further, slaves who converted to Islam could petition for their freedom, and many of the Christians enslaved during the wars with Habsburg Austria, Hungary, and the Republic of Venice converted to Islam in order to secure their release. Many of these newly freed converts settled in the growing cities, further contributing to their growth and development.|$|E
50|$|The Boyds were {{considered}} among the most prominent families of Hawaii, and their residence in Maunawili was often frequented by Hawaiian royalty, visiting foreign dignitaries, and world-famous writers and artists. Boyd's father made his fortune as a merchant and cattle rancher and served many political posts in the Kingdom's legislature, so it <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> James would follow in his footsteps.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, touring, {{for so long}} a pilgrimage for the Devil's Nite faithful, was {{starting}} to slow down for the band. August has said, [...] "some members of the band {{felt that they had}} earned the right to play for more national acts, and as a result, some local shows actually started getting turned down; in retrospect, and although in a sense it <b>was</b> <b>understandable,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> probably the beginning of the writing appearing on the wall".|$|R
30|$|However, {{this study}} found that {{risk-taking}} {{was not a significant}} factor that affected entrepreneurial intention. The finding supported Robinson and Stubberud (2014) and Ekpe and Mat (2012) but was dissimilar to Yurtkoru et al. (2014), Bolton and Lane (2012) and Kropp et al. (2008). Entrepreneurship is a process which requires the entrepreneurs to assume risk. Thus, low risk-taking ability would definitely hinder the individuals from taking up entrepreneurial activities. Furthermore, students were lacking of the necessary resources in becoming entrepreneurs; thus, it <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> their risk-taking ability did not drive them towards entrepreneurship.|$|R
25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these women want to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and make them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the reign of}} two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian’s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion {{with some of the}} same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian’s attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism’s system of tradition.|$|E

The postulates themselves are simple and apparent: {{the first and the}} fifth postulate set the definition of the coordinate and the definition of its evolution. The second and the fourth postulate define the momentum and define its evolution. The third postulate sets the superposition principle. On the basis of these statements it is possible to obtain the wave equation. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
50|$|Once {{again the}} German Foreign Ministry sent Ludwig Weissauer to Finland May 5, {{this time to}} clarify that war between Germany and the Soviet Union would not be {{launched}} before spring 1942. Ryti and Witting believed that, at least officially, and forwarded the message to Swedish Foreign Minister Günther, who was visiting Finland May 6-9. Witting also sent the information to Finnish-ambassador-to-London Gripenberg. When the war broke out {{only a couple of}} weeks later, it <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> both Swedish and British governments felt that the Finns had lied to them.|$|R
5000|$|He couldn’t {{register}} the magazine himself - because Omar Faig was a “problem” person, and authorities were rather afraid of him. He invited Jalil Mammadguluzadeh {{to work as}} editor-in-chief. Two Tbilisi Germans: Schmerling and Rotter, who created absolutely new style for the magazine, became its illustrators; besides <b>that</b> their illustrations <b>were</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> they didn’t need any signature.Omar Faig and Mammadguluzade devised plots for the caricatures - problems existing in the Caucasus at that times {{could be seen in}} these caricatures: illiteracy, closed situation of women, arrogance of clerks and police’s outrage.|$|R
500|$|Frances Anderson, in 1974 characterised Smart's [...] "illness" [...] as {{insanity}} and obsession, but {{believed that}} [...] "Smart's madness consisted {{of his efforts}} to obey literally St Paul's injunction to the Thessalonians: 'Pray without ceasing. During his episodes of illness, as Anderson continued, Smart [...] "probably suffered some periods of delirium" [...] but also [...] "appeared {{to know what he}} was doing". Smart's actions were similar to 18th-century Methodists that were [...] "addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits. Such displayers of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses, but also to Bedlam". Later, in 1998, Charles Rosen pointed out that [...] "The Enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for the uneducated and the great unwashed" [...] and [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries: Smart, Blake, and Hölderlin." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is {{as if he has}} prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave {{a lot of room for}} rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a common}} {{misunderstanding}} that Sun Voyager is a Viking ship.

5000|$|In {{testimony}} by Joseph Bangert, he describes traveling in a [...] "truckload of grunt Marines" [...] when [...] "there were some Vietnamese {{children at the}} gateway of the village and they gave the old finger gesture at us. It <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> they picked this up from GIs there. They stopped the trucks -- they didn't stop the truck, they slowed down a little bit, {{and it was just}} like response, the guys got up, including the lieutenants, and just blew all the kids away. There were about five or six kids blown away, and then the truck just continued down the hill." ...|$|R

500|$|On January 20 {{that year}} the Soviets {{announced}} that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later {{claimed that the}} specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing. [...] Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the Palace of Culture of Tirana {{on the occasion of}} his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in Durrës, was [...] "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'" [...] On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier Alexei Kosygin sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it as it has in the past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit." [...] On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana [...] "and was never to return." [...] On August 26, [...] "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," [...] the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October. An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, [...] "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus {{in the first years of}} the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gainsborough {{was one of}} {{the capital}} cities of Mercia during the Anglo-Saxon period, which had preceded Danish rule.

5000|$|It was {{embarrassing}} for an upper-class officer like Parker {{to be killed}} in such a small fight. It <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the British report of the battle differs.|$|E
50|$|Criticism {{leveled against}} Raja for allying with English East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not {{rational}} {{in light of}} an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially {{not because he was}} a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So it <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> many leader of Malabar - Pazhassi Raja included - allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.|$|R
30|$|It <b>is</b> {{intuitively}} <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> {{the presence}} of a layer reduces the available density of states for given energy, or equivalently increases the Fermi energy for a given density of electrons. The presence of a layer generically implies boundary or matching conditions which reduce the number of available states at a given energy.|$|R

50|$|Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> {{the chosen}} one to replace Pere Monzó was {{somebody}} who had a similar academic qualification to be elected rector, and {{had the advantage of}} being a former student of the Jesuit School of Saint Paul.|$|E
50|$|Most important, it <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> Israel has an {{interest}} supporting diplomatically, militarily and operationally Turkey’s and Jordan’s actions against Syria, such as securing tribal alliances with Arab tribes that cross into Syrian territory and are hostile to the Syrian ruling elite.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} {{are those that}} persist for long periods, affect {{one way or another}} the normal life of people and generally can only be controlled, not cure, with medical interventions currently available, so it <b>is</b> easily <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the proper compliance with therapeutic indications is a key to obtaining good long-term results in these sufferings...|$|R

It might as well be a black box with a person inside who, in fact, acts like a person, hence “fits the data” from what other people do in the same situations.|$|R
