40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae {{is a human}} {{commensal}} and opportunistic pathogen {{that has}} become a leading causative agent of hospital-based infections over the past few decades. The emergence and global expansion of hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant (MDR) clones of K.  pneumoniae have been increasingly reported in community-acquired and nosocomial infections. Despite this, the population genomics and epidemiology of MDR K.  pneumoniae at the national level are still poorly understood. To obtain insights into these, we analyzed a systematic large-scale collection of invasive MDR K.  pneumoniae isolates from hospitals across the United Kingdom and Ireland. Using whole-genome phylogenetic analysis, we placed these in the context of previously sequenced K.  pneumoniae populations from geographically diverse countries and identified their virulence and drug resistance determinants. Our results demonstrate that United Kingdom and Ireland MDR isolates are a highly diverse population drawn from across the global phylogenetic tree of K.  pneumoniae and represent multiple recent <b>international</b> <b>introductions</b> that are mainly from Europe but in some cases from more distant countries. In addition, we identified novel genetic determinants underlying resistance to beta-lactams, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracyclines, indicating that both increased virulence and resistance have emerged independently multiple times throughout the population. Our data show that MDR K.  pneumoniae isolates in the United Kingdom and Ireland have multiple distinct origins and appear {{to be part of a}} globally circulating K.  pneumoniae population...|$|E

He had the armor removed and retrofitted the plane with commercial engines, christening it the “Reynolds Bombshell.” He hired war-hero Bill Odom as pilot, Tex Sallee as copilot, and in 1947 the three of them flew around the world in 78 hours, 55.5 minutes, making four stops for refueling, to set the world record for twin-engine propeller aircraft. (The previous record, set by Howard Hughes, was 91 hours, 14 minutes. Both records were surpassed in 1957.)

40|$|Die vorliegende Untersuchung betrachtet die Zusammenarbeit mit dem lokalen Produktmanagement bei der internationalen Markteinführung von neuen Produkten. Ausgehend von der Feststellung, dass die internationale Markteinführung von neuen Produkten zunehmend standardisiert und zentralisiert durchgeführt wird, wurde im Rahmen einer empirischen Untersuchung die Zusammenarbeit bei internationalen Markteinführungen in der Konsumgüterindustrie aus Sicht der Tochtergesellschaften untersucht. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Initiierung und Steuerung der Markteinführung vor allem beim globalen sowie regionalen Produktmanagement liegt. Innovationsabteilungen und Lead Countries spielen eine untergeordnete Rolle. Trotz der in der Literatur beschriebenen Schnittstellen-, Akzeptanz- und Motivationsprobleme wird die Zusammenarbeit mit den zentralen Einheiten aus Sicht des lokalen Produktmanagement als tendenziell positiv beurteilt. Verbesserungspotentiale werden in einer besseren Information des lokalen Produktmanagements und einer stärkeren Berücksichtigung der lokalen Besonderheiten gesehen. [...] Our {{research}} {{describes the}} cooperation between central organizational units and local product management in <b>international</b> product <b>introductions</b> of consumer goods. It {{is based on}} the assumption that the process of <b>international</b> product <b>introductions</b> today is highly standardized and centralized. We report the results of a survey in the consumer goods industry. These show that the <b>international</b> market <b>introduction</b> is primarily initiated and led by a regional or global product management. Innovation departments and lead countries play a minor role. From the perspective of the local product management the cooperation with the central department is evaluated overall as positive - opposite to often described interface -, acceptance- and motivation problems. But the cooperation could be improved: information transfer with the local product management should be increased and the local market differences should be taken much more into account.
