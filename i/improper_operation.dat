25|$|During the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation, no {{evidence}} of failure or malfunction of the aircraft or any of its systems prior to the crash was found. Further examination of the engine found approximately five fluid ounces of jet fuel in the entire fuel system and that the engine had flamed out due to fuel starvation. The final report from the NTSB lists the probable causes as improper in-flight decisions and mismanagement of fuel by the pilot in command which led to fuel exhaustion. Also listed was <b>improper</b> <b>operation</b> of flight controls during the power-off autorotation.|$|E
2500|$|Quality {{gasoline}} {{should be}} stable {{for six months}} if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to {{the separation of the}} components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, <b>improper</b> <b>operation</b> will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Storage should be in an airtight container (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may be created, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called [...] "stale fuel". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).|$|E

40|$|Oral {{adjustments}} involving abrasive machining with dental handpieces and abrasive burs are {{the common}} practice in clinical dentistry. This practice dates back 7, 000 - 9, 000 years. However, the process itself is undoubtedly the least understood and most neglected in modern abrasive technology. In fact, <b>improper</b> <b>operations</b> of oral adjustments are the potential root cause of restoration failure. This paper presents a scientific approach to grindability of dental ceramics in the invitro clinical oral regime using diamond burs and air-turbine dental handpieces. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied to analyse the grindabilities of dental ceramics {{under the influence of}} the clinical conditions. The results show that grindability of dental ceramics in the clinical oral regime revealed different scales compared to ceramic machining in the engineering regime. The discussion includes grinding-induced problems in the oral regime, such as vibration, hearing loss, surface and subsurface damage, and thermal damage to soft tissues...|$|R

50|$|A {{system with}} high failure {{transparency}} will alert users that a component failure has occurred, {{even if it}} continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated. Likewise, a fail-fast component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then. This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent <b>improper</b> <b>operation</b> in a broken state.|$|E
30|$|Overtaking {{accidents}} {{caused by}} <b>improper</b> <b>operations</b> {{performed by a}} driver occur frequently. However, most studies on overtaking safety have neglected research into driver control input. A novel method is proposed to obtain the driver control input during the overtaking process. Meanwhile, to improve the safety of overtaking, two types of safe distances, {{and the time of}} the overtaking are considered. Path constraints are established when considering the two types of safe distances. An optimal control model is established to solve the minimum time maneuver under multiple constraints. Using the Gauss pseudospectral method, the optimal control problem is converted into a nonlinear programming problem, which is then solved through sequential quadratic programming (SQP). In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified {{based on the results of}} a Carsim simulation. The simulation results show that by adopting an inverse dynamics method to solve the manipulation problem of the vehicle’s minimum overtaking time, the manipulation capability of a vehicle in completing an overtaking safely within the minimum time can be obtained. This method can provide a reference for research into the active safety of manned and unmanned vehicles.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} in Hawai'i {{numerous}} shallow waste injection wells, constructed for the disposal of domestic sewage effluent, have failed to operate as designed or desired. In {{the course of this}} study a field reconnaissance of all the known waste injection wells on O'ahu and Kaua'i, and approximately half of those on Maui, was made and their methods of operation and injection problems evaluated. The results {{of this study indicate that}} injection well problems are primarily due to physical and biological, and probably to a much lesser extent, chemical clogging phenomena at the well face. The clogging in a large part results from <b>improper</b> treatment plant <b>operation,</b> <b>improper</b> injection well <b>operation</b> and maintenance, and poor well site selection. Improper well construction practices also contribute to a much lesser degree. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that inadequate data collection, both prior to and after injection has begun, makes early detection and solution of the injection problems more difficult. Recommendations for more adequate data collection and treatment plant and injection well operation and maintenance are made which hopefully will avoid or at least alleviate many of the injection well problems encountered in this study.

5000|$|Brinelling [...] is the {{permanent}} indentation {{of a hard}} surface. It is named after the Brinell scale of hardness, in which a small ball is pushed against a hard surface at a preset level of force, and the depth and diameter of the mark indicates the Brinell hardness of the surface. Brinelling {{is a process of}} wear in which similar marks are pressed into the surface of a moving part, such as bearings or hydraulic pistons. The brinelling is usually undesirable, as the parts often mate with other parts in very close proximity. The very small indentations can quickly lead to <b>improper</b> <b>operation,</b> like chattering or excess vibration, which in turn can accelerate other forms of wear, such as spalling and galling.|$|E

40|$|Indoor climate {{installations}} {{are widely}} used in modern office buildings. Statistical data show that the energy consumption in buildings has grown quickly in the past decades. A considerable part is due to inefficient and <b>improper</b> <b>operations</b> of installations. Therefore, Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) for indoor climate installations has fallen increasingly into the research scope. A new approach called Level-Oriented Fault Detection and Diagnosis (LOFDD) is presented. It analyses {{the performance of the}} installations on different levels. 1. Global level on which the overall performance of energy consumption of the whole building is analysed. Fuzzy Neural Networks modelling has been adopted. By analysing the peak response from the model, the fault will be detected. When a fault is detected on this level, the next level is activated for further diagnosis. 2. Domain level on which the performance of rooms or zones are analysed. Physical model based method is discussed and applied. With the help of the characteristic parameters, the fault may be detected and diagnosed on this level or further diagnosis can be done on the next level. 3. Sub-domain level on which the detailed components are analysed. Several faults are introduced into the real installations. A new Pattern Match Method is presented and it shows good capability for fault detection and diagnosis. On this level the fault will eventually be diagnosed. Experiments are carried out to validate the method in this thesis. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|R
