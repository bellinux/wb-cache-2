5|$|Efficiency is {{essential}} to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E

5|$|When within {{missile range}} of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge. He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, {{commanded}} by Parmenion, was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central phalanx crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander {{and the rest of}} his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E

25|$|Upon being {{appointed}} Prime Minister of Italy, Mussolini had to form {{a coalition}} government because the Fascists did not have control over the Italian parliament. Mussolini's coalition government initially pursued economically liberal policies {{under the direction of}} liberal finance minister Alberto De Stefani, a member of the Center Party, including balancing the budget through <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> to the civil service. Initially, little drastic change in government policy had occurred and repressive police actions were limited.|$|E
25|$|Upon a papal death, {{the ring}} {{used to be}} ceremonially {{destroyed}} using a hammer {{in the presence of}} other Cardinals by the Camerlengo. This was done to prevent issuance of forged documents during the interregnum, or sede vacante. Today, the destruction of the ring's device with deep scratches is a symbol of the end of rule of the pope who used to wear that ring. This custom was followed after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI by applying two <b>deep</b> <b>cuts,</b> {{in the shape of a}} cross, on the signet with a chisel.|$|E

25|$|Despite his injuries, Glass regained consciousness, {{but found}} himself abandoned, without weapons or equipment.

Glass lay {{mutilated}} and alone, more than 200miles (320km) from the nearest American settlement, at Fort Kiowa, on the Missouri River. Glass set the bone of his own leg, wrapped himself in the bear hide his companions had placed over him as a shroud, and began crawling back to Fort Kiowa. To prevent gangrene, Glass allowed maggots to eat the dead, infected flesh in his wounds.|$|E

U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking, and the corporate PC market was not buying pending the release of Microsoft's Windows Vista in 2007.

25|$|Hawke's {{leadership}} was finally irrevocably damaged {{towards the end}} of 1991, as new Liberal Leader John Hewson released 'Fightback!', a detailed proposal for sweeping economic change, including the introduction of a goods and services tax and <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> to government spending and personal income tax. The package appeared to take Hawke by complete surprise, and his response to it was judged to be extremely ineffective. Many within the Labor Party appeared to lose faith in him over this, and Keating duly challenged for the leadership a second time on 19 December 1991, this time narrowly defeating Hawke by 56 votes to 51.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, CUNY {{suffered}} another {{fiscal crisis}} when Governor George Pataki proposed a drastic cut in state financing. Faculty cancelled classes and students staged protests. By May, CUNY adopted <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> to college budgets and class offerings. By June, {{in order to}} save money spent on remedial programs, CUNY adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges: students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, this a departure from the 1970 Open Admissions program. That year's final state budget cut funding by $102million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and offering a retirement incentive plan for faculty.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} source {{considered as}} {{evidence for a}} connection between the eighth-century codex and Boniface is in a tenth-century vita of the saint written in Utrecht, which says that the saint held a gospel over his head as protection. The Ragyndrudis Codex is not a gospel, but rather a collection of texts on exegesis, apologia, and dogma, but this has not prevented the Codex from being regarded as the saint's shield, an idea enforced by <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> through the (original) binding and pages. The Codex is held in the Domschatz, the treasury of the Fulda Cathedral; a facsimile is on display in the cathedral's museum.|$|E
