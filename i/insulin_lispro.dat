25|$|Eli Lilly and Company {{developed}} and marketed the first rapid-acting insulin analogue (<b>insulin</b> <b>lispro</b> rDNA) Humalog. It was engineered through recombinant DNA technology {{so that the}} penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the B-chain were reversed.

This allowed larger amounts of active monomeric insulin to be available for postprandial (after meal) injections.|$|E
25|$|These {{modifications}} {{have been}} used to create two types of insulin analogs: those that are more readily absorbed from the injection site and therefore act faster than natural insulin injected subcutaneously, intended to supply the bolus level of insulin needed at mealtime (prandial insulin); and those that are released slowly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours, intended to supply the basal level of insulin during the day and particularly at nighttime (basal insulin).

25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} insulin are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely related}} to the human insulin structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (<b>insulin</b> <b>lispro),</b> it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E

MethodsThis was a subgroup analysis of patients from Argentina and Mexico in the 4 B study (N= 114).

Weight was stable in the exenatide BID group (− 0. 1 kg) and increased significantly (+ 3. 4 kg; P< 0. 0001) with <b>insulin</b> <b>lispro.</b> Major and minor hypoglycemia occurred less frequently (40 vs. 253 events) with exenatide BID compared with <b>insulin</b> <b>lispro.</b> Gastrointestinal adverse events of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting occurred more frequently with exenatide BID than with <b>insulin</b> <b>lispro.</b> ConclusionsBoth exenatide BID and prandial <b>insulin</b> <b>lispro,</b> each added to basal insulin glargine, were effective at reducing HbA 1 c in Latin American patients.

40|$|Besides dietary approaches, various {{pharmacological}} means {{have been}} recently developed {{in order to}} better control postprandial hyperglycaemia.

Some hormones (amylin, glucagon-like peptide- 1) can slow gastric emptying while alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol) retard intestinal digestion and resorption of complex carbohydrates.

40|$|Insulin {{is one of}} the {{top five}} {{recombinant}} therapeutic proteins in global sales. It is the only recombinant protein produced at the tons per year scale. The production of insulin requires many chromatographic steps. A key downstream polishing step, the reversed phase chromatography, RPC, removes the structurally similar impurities before size exclusion chromatography and crystallization. The design and optimization of RPC for insulin purification process has been challenging in the preparative scale. The lack of systematic approach in protein purification results in empirical, time consuming, and expensive screening of various loading and operating conditions. ^ The goal of this work is to develop strategies for designing new insulin purification processes with high purity, high yield, and high productivity. A model-based approach combining experiments, theoretical analysis, and mathematical modeling is used to achieve the research goal. This work is composed of two parts: model development and process design. The modified reversed phase modulator isotherm and the general rate model were tested to describe <b>lispro</b> <b>insulin</b> and its impurities. To estimate the intrinsic model parameters, this study developed a systematic and efficient method that only requires small pulse linear gradient elution runs with two gradient slopes and frontal experiments with three organic fractions. With the same set of intrinsic parameters, the model predicted closely with the experimental data over a wide range of loading and operating conditions: loading volume up to 4 column volumes, acetonitrile fraction from 0. 19 to 0. 43, linear velocity up to 6 cm/min, and in various elution modes such as frontal, linear gradient, isocratic, and stepwise elution. ^ The second part of this study applied the verified model and parameters to elucidate the competitive adsorption and the competing mass transfer mechanisms in <b>lispro</b> <b>insulin</b> purification.

The dosages of both types of insulin were adjusted to attain preprandial glucose levels of < 6. 1 mmol/l within 1 week with similar rates of glucose decline.
