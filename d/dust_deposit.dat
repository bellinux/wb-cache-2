40|$|Context. <b>Dust</b> <b>deposits</b> or <b>dust</b> cover are a {{prevalent}} morphology in {{the northern}} hemi-nucleus of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P). The evolution of the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> was captured by the OSIRIS camera system onboard the Rosetta spacecraft having escorted the comet for over two years. The observations {{shed light on the}} fundamental role of cometary activity in shaping and transforming the surface morphology. Aims: We aim to present OSIRIS observations of surface changes over the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> before and after perihelion. The distribution of changes and a timeline of their occurrence are provided. We perform a data analysis to quantify the surface changes and investigate their correlation to water activity from the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits.</b> We further discuss how the results of our investigation are related to other findings from the Rosetta mission. Methods: Surface changes were detected via systematic comparison of images, and quantified using shape-from-shading technique. Thermal models were applied to estimate the erosion of water ice in response to the increasing insolation over the areas where surface changes occurred. Modeling results were used for the interpretation of the observed surface changes. Results: Surface changes discussed here were concentrated at mid-latitudes, between about 20 °N and 40 °N, marking a global transition from the dust-covered to rugged terrains. The changes were distributed in open areas exposed to ample solar illumination and likely subject to enhanced surface erosion before perihelion. The occurrence of changes followed the southward migration of the sub-solar point across the latitudes of their distribution. The erosion at locations of most changes was at least about 0. 5 m, but most likely did not exceed several meters. The erosive features before perihelion had given way to a fresh, smooth cover of <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> after perihelion, suggesting that the <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> had been globally restored by at least about 1 m with ejecta from the intensely illuminated southern hemi-nucleus around perihelion, when the north was inactive during polar night. Conclusions: The erosion and restoration of the northern <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> are morphological expressions of seasonality on 67 P.

40|$|Dust {{raising and}} {{transport}} are common and important processes in Australia today. The aridity of the Australian continent and high climatic variability result in widespread dust raising in the arid and semi-arid areas and transport to the humid margins and surrounding oceans. The supply of erodible particles {{appears to be}} the greatest limitation on total flux of transported dust. Dust raising is greatest in the Lake Eyre Basin, including the Simpson Desert, and Murray-Darling Basin where internal drainage renews supplies of fine particles to the arid zone. In the west and northwest dust entrainment is low, despite considerable aridity. The marine record of dust flux shows at least a threefold increase in dust flux, compared with the Holocene, in the last glacial maximum in both tropical and temperate Australia, driven by weakened Australian monsoon rains and drier westerly circulation, respectively. Despite the widespread confirmation of aeolian <b>dust</b> <b>deposits</b> in southeastern and southwestern Australia, dated or quantified records are extremely rare.

A quarter complained of respiratory distress after working on combine harvesters or near grain driers and elevators, with cough, wheezing, and breathlessness, sometimes so severe as to prevent work.

Verticillium/Paecilomyces type spores, mostly from Verticillium lecanii, Aphanocladium album, and Paecilomyces bacillosporus, were abundant in the dust.

This information aims to identify the geometric and topological features of the elements of the deposit. The curators can use this information in order to design suitable prevention and maintenance actions for objects and environments.

40|$|It {{is noted}} {{that more than}} one-fourth of all craters larger than 25 km in {{diameter}} between - 50 deg S and 50 deg N have localized deposits of coarse material on the floor which {{are associated with the}} dark 'splotches' that are seen visually. If homogeneous, unconsolidated materials are assumed, the measured thermal inertias of these deposits imply effective grain sizes that range from 0. 1 mm to 1 cm, with a modal value of 0. 9 mm. Even though these deposits are coarser and darker than the surrounding terrains and the greater part of the Martian surface, they are not compositionally distinct from materials with similar albedos. It is thought most likely that these features were formed by entrapment of marginally mobile material that can be transported into, but not out of, crater depressions by the wind. Most of the 'splotch' deposits are coarser than the dune-forming materials occurring in the north polar region and inside extreme southern latitude craters; they probably form low, broad zibar dunes or lag deposits.
