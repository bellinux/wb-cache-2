However, if also considering parallel execution of plans, then the addition of actions to a plan may sometimes decrease the execution time.

Examples of such applications are manufacturing and error-recovery for industrial processes. Many different kinds of computations can be made to improve the cost of a plan [...] - only a few of which have been extensively studied in the literature. The most well-k [...] ...|$|R

An “extremist”, who can either be a hawk or a dove, attempts to manipulate decision making. <b>If</b> <b>actions</b> are strategic complements, a hawkish extremist {{increases the likelihood of}} conflict, and reduces welfare, by sending a public message which triggers hawkish behavior from both players. <b>If</b> <b>actions</b> are strategic substitutes, a dovish extremist instead sends a public message which causes one player to become more dovish and the other more hawkish.

Agents with extreme agendas sometimes take provocative actions that inflame conflicts.
