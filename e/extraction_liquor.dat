40|$|A novel {{mechanical}} pre-treatment {{method was}} used to separate the wood chips into fiber bundles in order to extract high molecular weight wood polymers. The mechanical pre-treatment involved chip compression in a conical plug-screw followed by defibration in a fiberizer. The fiberized wood was treated with hot water at various combinations of time and temperature in order to analyze the extraction yield of hemicelluloses at different conditions. Nearly 6 mg/g wood of galactoglucomannan was obtained at 90 degrees C/ 120 min which was about three times more than what could be extracted from wood chips. The extracted carbohydrates had molecular weight ranging up to 60 kDa. About 10 % {{of each of the}} extracted material had a molecular weight above 30 kDa.

30|$|Acetone {{extracts}} {{were found}} to retard growth of both fungi tested to a similar extent as the ethanol extracts (Table  4) although they comprised only roughly half the weight (Table  3) so were roughly twice as potent (Table  4). This is somewhat at odds with observations by Anderson et al. ([1962]) who reported that acetone extraction of solid wood (in contrast to water extraction) only slightly reduced decay resistance against G. trabeum. To verify {{the findings of the}} current study, another sample from Tree A was extracted with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus for 8 h. The <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor</b> was collected and all the solvent evaporated (which facilitated chemical changes). The remaining solid was bioactive as it slowed the growth of G. trabeum to 76 % (data not shown). This result showed that that compounds with fungicidal properties were present in acetone extracts independent of extraction method and that they are reasonably stable against chemical degradation.|$|E

In this study the separation and purification of hemicelluloses from water <b>extraction</b> <b>liquors</b> containing wood hemicelluloses, lignin compounds and monosaccharide by using membrane filtration was investigated. The isolation of the hemicelluloses from the wood hydrolysates was performed in two steps: concentration of high molar mass hemicelluloses by ultrafiltration and separation of low molar mass hemicelluloses from monomeric sugars using tight ultrafiltration membranes. The purification of the retained hemicelluloses was performed by diafiltration. During the filtration experiments, the permeate flux through ultrafiltration and tight ultrafiltration membranes was relatively high. The fouling ability of the used membranes was relatively low. In our experiments, the retention of hemicelluloses using two filtration steps was almost complete. The separation of monosaccharides from hemicelluloses was relatively high and the purification of hemicelluloses by diafiltration was highly efficient. The separation of lignin from hemicelluloses was partially achieved. Diafiltration showed potential to purify retained hemicelluloses from lignin and other organics. The bes...|$|R

The analysis showed that the traditional method cannot be applied for sugar analysis, and an improvement on the method was required. In fact, the presence of furfural in the PHL sample {{was the reason for}} the required modification. It was noted that the removal of furfural via evaporation could improve the reliability of the HPAEC technique for sugar assessments. If the concentration of furfural was higher than 0. 045 % (wt.) in the PHL, the error introduced in the sugar analysis was profound. Also, the industrially produced PHL contained more furfural than the laboratory produced PHL under the same hydrolysis conditions. Consequently, the concentration of furfural in the PHL should be taken into account for sugar analysis using the HPAEC technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{residual}} lignin in birch wood after a hot water extraction in a batch reactor was investigated {{as a function}} of extraction temperature and time. A kinetic model fitting the experimental data was then developed to explain delignification of wood during a hot water treatment. Results showed that delignification kinetics involves simultaneous degradation and condensation reactions, with degradation of lignin being much faster than its condensation. Native lignin in wood was successfully modeled as the sum of two fractions with different degradation rates. The rates of degradation and condensation increased along with increasing extraction temperature. The proportion of acid-soluble lignin to acid-insoluble (Klason) lignin in the wood residue decreased with increasing extraction temperature and time, probably due to chemical and structural changes in the lignin during the hot water treatment. Condensed lignin was predominantly determined as Klason lignin. On the other hand, the amount of soluble lignin in the <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor</b> increased slightly with temperature, but remained mostly constant after any extraction time. An insoluble fraction in the liquor that originated from precipitated lignin fragments is believed to contain traces of degradation products from carbohydrates or other degradation compounds...|$|E
40|$|Conference Name:International Conference on Biomass and Energy Technologies (ICBT). Conference Address: Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:AUG 20 - 22, 2010. Woody biomass is {{renewable}} only if sustainable {{production is}} imposed. An optimum and sustainable biomass stand production rate {{is found to}} be one with the incremental growth rate at harvest equal to the average overall growth rate. Utilization of woody biomass leads to a sustainable economy. Woody biomass is comprised of at least four components: extractives, hemicellulose. lignin and cellulose. While extractives and hemicellulose are least resistant to chemical and thermal degradation, cellulose is most resistant to chemical, thermal:and biological attack. The difference or heterogeneity in reactivity leads to the recalcitrance of woody biomass at conversion. A selection of processes is presented together as a biorefinery based on incremental sequential deconstruction, fractionation/conversion of woody biomass to achieve efficient separation of major components. A preference is given to a biorefinery absent of pretreatment and detoxification process that produce waste byproducts. While numerous biorefinery approaches are known, a focused review on the integrated studies of water-based biorefinery processes is presented. Hot-water extraction is the first process step to extract value from woody biomass while improving the quality of the remaining solid material. This first step removes extractives and hemicellulose fractions from woody biomass. While extractives and hemicellulose are largely removed in the <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor,</b> cellulose and lignin largely remain in the residual woody structure. Xylo-oligomers, aromatics and acetic acid in the hardwood extract are the major components having the greatest potential value for development. Higher temperature and longer residence time lead to higher mass removal. While high temperature (> 200 degrees C) can lead to nearly total dissolution, the amount of sugars present in the <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor</b> decreases rapidly with temperature. Dilute acid hydrolysis of concentrated wood extracts renders the wood extract with monomeric sugars. At higher acid concentration and higher temperature the hydrolysis produced more xylose monomers in a comparatively shorter period of reaction time. Xylose is the most abundant monomeric sugar in the hydrolysate. The other comparatively small amounts of monomeric sugars include arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and galactose. Acetic acid. formic acid, furfural. HMF and other byproducts are inevitably generated during the acid hydrolysis process. Short reaction time is preferred for the hydrolysis of hot-water wood extracts. Acid hydrolysis presents a perfect opportunity for the removal or separation of aromatic materials from the wood extract/hydrolysate. The hot-water wood extract hydrolysate, after solid-removal, can be purified by Nano-membrane filtration to yield a fermentable sugar stream. Fermentation products such as ethanol can be produced from the sugar stream without a detoxification step. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Alkaline extractions of oil shale In the presence of potassium permanganate and of previously air oxidized oil shale were both studied.

The new process, termed the "near neutral " hemicellulose extraction process, involves the extraction of wood hemicellulose using green liquor prior to conventional Kraft pulping. This thesis assumes that the new process is located at an existing kraft pulp mill. Ancillary unit operations in the process include hydrolysis of the extracted carbohydrates using sulfuric acid, filtration of the extract to remove lignin that was extracted with the carbohydrates, liquid-liquid extraction of acetic acid and by-product furfural, liming of the hydrolyzed extract, separation of gypsum which {{is the product of}} the liming reaction, fermentation of C 5 and C 6 sugars and upgrading of the acetic acid and ethanol products by distillation.

40|$|Wood – a raw {{material}} for {{pulp and paper industry}} - contains large amount of hemicelluloses, which are partly dissolved in black liquor in the chemical pulping process. Hardwood is particularly rich in hemicelluloses, i. e. pentosans. This work investigates a possibility of extraction of hemicelluloses prior to kraft cooking in order to find applications for the isolated polysaccharides and increase mill capacities. The response of the cooking process and pulp properties is analysed. The optimal conditions for targeted 90 - 95 % yield of wood after pre- treatment were determined to be at temperature 150 °C, liquid-to-wood ratio 3 : 1 and dilute sulphuric acid charge of 0, 18 % on wood weight. Water pre- treatment was found to be less efficient due to the need for longer dwell times of wood chips. The degree of the extraction and the yield of the extracted hemicelluloses in combination with liquid-to-wood ratio should be sufficient to provide high concentrations of pentosans in the <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor.</b> Target Kappa number of the pulp cooked from pre-treated chips was obtained with half of the H-factor compared with the standard pulp. The yield of pulp decreased equally to the amount of the material removed in the pre- treatment stage.

Strength properties of the pre-treated pulps were found to be surprisingly lower, than that of the standard pulp. Lower extent of the hemicelluloses removal in the pre-treatment stage gives increase in strength properties. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Wet brewery residue alone or combined with soybean hulls and citrus pulp were ensiled in laboratory silos. Liquor was extracted by a manual screw-press and a 2 -mL aliquot was fixed with 0. 4 mL formic acid. Two 10 -g silage samples from each silo were diluted in 20 mL deionized water or 17 % formic acid solution (alternative methods). Aliquots obtained by the three methods were used to determine the silage contents of fermentation end-products. The accuracy of the alternative methods was evaluated by comparing mean bias of estimates obtained by manual screw-press and by alternative methods, whereas precision was assessed by the root mean square prediction error and the residual error. Robustness was determined by studying the interaction between bias and chemical components, pH, in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and buffer capacity. The 17 % formic acid method was more accurate for estimating acetic, butyric and lactic acids, although it resulted in low overestimates of propionic acid and underestimates of ethanol. The deionized water method overestimated acetic and propionic acids and slightly underestimated ethanol. The 17 % formic acid method was more precise than deionized water for estimating all organic acids and ethanol. The robustness of each method with respect to variation in the silage chemical composition, IVDMD and pH is dependent on the fermentation end-product at evaluation. The robustness of the alternative methods seems to be critical at the determination of lactic acid and ethanol contents. 201...|$|R
40|$|Biogas, {{a mixture}} of methane and carbon dioxide, is {{produced}} by microorganisms upon degradation of organic matter in an anaerobic environment. It has been realised that by utilising anaerobic processes the organic pollutants in wastewater and organic solid waste from anthropogenic sources can be converted into a renewable source of energy. However, to fulfil the potential of anaerobic digestion in a sustainable society several measures must be taken. Anaerobic digestion {{has the potential to}} be applicable to waste and effluents which are currently not being utilized provided that suitable reactor concepts are developed. For example, within the pulp and paper industry, there is a potential to treat more inhibitory and less degradable effluents to realise energyproduction provided that suitable methods and processes can be found. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBs) have been used for anaerobic treatment of effluents from the pulp and paper industry. Treatment of {{a mixture of}} sulphite evaporator condensate (SEC) and caustic <b>extraction</b> <b>liquor</b> (CEL) in a UASB compared favourably to treatment in a full-scale contact-process (CP). The UASB reactor showed a higher reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) (74 - 84 %) at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 2. 3 kg COD (m 3 d) - 1 than the CP (65 % COD reduction, 1. 4 kg COD (m 3 d) - 1). However, the CP effluent contained lower concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) than the UASB effluent. Upon treatment of spent sulphite liquor (SSL) in a UASB the maximum influent COD concentration and OLR leading to stable reactor performance were 78 g COD l- 1 and 51 g COD (l d) - 1, respectively. In batch reactors the biogas production was totally inhibited at COD concentrations above 40 g COD l- 1. This adaptation of a granular community to increased levels of toxic substrate illustrates one advantage of the granular process when dealing with toxic effluents. Low-rate systems commonly applied today are normally loaded far below their capacity to prevent overloading and instability. The utilization of these systems can be increased by applying new monitoring systems that provide information for control so that the loading of the process can be optimised without jeopardizing the stability. A spectrophotometric method for monitoring alkalinity in anaerobic digestion processes was developed. The method is based on measurements of pH-indicators in mixtures of an acid and samples from the reactor system. Good correlation was found between the traditional titration method for alkalinity measurement and the spectrophotometric method when measuring samples from an anaerobic digester. An on-line monitoring system based on the method was designed and applied to a UASB. A pulse organic overload to the reactor lead to a decrease in the partial alkalinity, which was registered by both methods. The response of the monitoring system correlated well with the traditional titration method. A fully automated device based on the spectrophotometric method was used for on-line monitoring a full-scale anaerobic digester operating on a mixture of municipal wastewater sludge and potato-processing waste. The system was found to respond to an overload situation in which the bicarbonate concentrations in the reactor decreased. Such an on-line monitoring system is of value with regards to increasing the efficiency of certain anaerobic processes...|$|E

Integrating a biorefinery to a pulp mill aims to improve the overall efficiency of raw material utilization and to offer new revenue opportunities besides pulp production. Because the field of pulp mill integrated biorefining is still relatively unexplored, {{it is necessary to}} develop methods for assessing the feasibility of alternative technologies. The purpose of this thesis project was to design a techno-economic analysis tool (TEA-tool) for Valmet’s offering of pulp mill integrated biorefineries. The tool was intended to evaluate the feasibility of four different biorefinery processes from the customer point of view. The general motivation for building the tool was to improve the accessibility of techno-economical methods for users with different backgrounds and to provide an unbiased profitability model for cross-technology comparisons. The biotechnologies included in the tool were lignin <b>extraction</b> from black <b>liquor</b> by LignoBoost, black pellet production by steam explosion, bark gasification and bio oil production by integrated fast pyrolysis. The thesis project consisted of building the tool and performing a rough feasibility comparison between the included technologies. The priority task of developing the TEA-tool succeeded well, receiving a positive overall reception. The tool allowed quick and effortless comparison between the technologies {{in a wide range of}} investment scenarios. The new TEA-tool will offer a flexible platform for Valmet’s future techno-economic evaluations. In general, the analysis boosted confidence on the economic potential of biorefining. The profitability model was discovered being the most sensitive to production capacities, end product values and substitute fuel prices. The selection of process parameters and feedstock properties had significantly lower impact on the profitability estimates. From the four biotechnology alternatives, LignoBoost and gasification processes were observed being the most profitable investments. The steam explosion process was shown to be competent with these technologies, but would require large production capacities to reach the same level of returns. The integrated pyrolysis process was shown to be theoretically highly profitable in favourable operating conditions. However, the incompleteness of bio oil markets slightly lowers the attractiveness of the particular pyrolysis process.

It describes systems involving compound formation, ion-association and solvation as well as solvent loading capacity, dispersion and coalescence. The aims of this thesis are also presented. Chapter 2 presents an introduction to yttrium chemistry and recent developments in yttrium extraction chemistry. It describes the relevant factors affecting the liquidliquid extraction process to determine the optimum conditions for yttriurn <b>extraction</b> from sulfate <b>liquor.</b> These factors include TiOA concentration, contact time, pH value, temperature, aqueous phase composition, diluent and construct of McCabe-Thiele diagram. In addition, the synergistic effect of using TBP, TOPO and D 2 EHPA and the optimum conditions for the stripping process are deten-nined. Chapter 3 contains introduction to cerium chemistry and recent developments in cerium extraction chemistry. The optimum conditions for solvent extraction of cenum(III) from a sulfate medium, and synergistic effects using TOPO and D 2 EHPA on the extraction process are studied. Also, the relevant factors affecting cerium(Ill) stripping efficiency are determined. Chapter 4 presents a brief introduction to lanthanum and recent developments in lanthanum extraction chemistry. The optimum conditions for solvent extraction of lanthanum from sulfate media, with synergistic effects using TOPO, D 2 EHPA and TBP are described. In addition, the suitable conditions for the lanthanum stripping process are determined. Chapter 5 contains the principles of separation and liquid-liquid extraction of binary (Y/La) and ternary (Nd-La-Y) element systems. The optimum conditions for the separation of both systems were investigated. Chapter 6 describes the synthesis and characterization of several novel piperazine and piperidine amide ligands. These ligands have good extraction ability for both light and heavy rare earth elements. The optimum conditions for solvent extraction of yttnum and cerium(III) using these ligands were studied. The chapter also, contains the experimental procedures and characterising data for ligand synthesis in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable use {{of forest}} and {{agricultural}} resources will {{play an important}} role for solving urgent global challenges such as the enhanced green house effect and increasing demand for fossil fuels. The development of processes where lignocellulosic biomass can be refined to several different end-products in the same plant, i. e. a biorefinary, will be important in the development towards a more sustainable society where fossil fuels are replaced. To be able to compete with fossil resources, an efficient production of biomass based products is required in order to maximize overall process economics and to minimize negative environmental impact. One solution to increase profitability for forest biomass based plants can be production of value added derivatives produced through fermentation of sugars from hemicelluloses, extracted from lignocellulosic material. The first part of this thesis investigate the impact of hemicellulose pre-extraction on birch Kraft pulp properties. White <b>liquor</b> and water <b>extractions</b> of hemicelluloses from birch wood chips were performed under conditions compatible with Kraft pulping. The chips from select extractions were subject to subsequent Kraft pulping and the refined pulps were made into hand sheets. Several metrics for hand sheet strength properties were compared with a reference pulp made without an extraction step. This work also includes a demonstration of enzymatic hydrolysis and biological conversion of extracted xylan to succinic acid, a metabolite with the potential of a platform chemical. The study demonstrated that white liquor can be utilized to extract xylan from birch wood chips prior to Kraft cooking without decreasing the pulp yield and paper strength properties, while simultaneously impregnating cooking alkali into the wood chips. Alkaline conditions tested above pH 10 significantly degraded xylan and very low concentrations of xylose were obtained using any of the alkaline extractions. Water extractions resulted in the highest final concentration of xylose, 29. 1 g/L; yielding fermentable liquor, but were found to negatively impact some pulp properties including decreases in compression strength, bursting strength, tensile strength and tensile stiffness while exhibiting minimal impact on elongation and slight improvement in tearing strength index. Since hot water <b>extractions</b> gave fermentable <b>liquors,</b> the next study was to integrate the production of green chemicals via hot water hemicellulose extraction of birch wood into a small-scale combined heat and power plant, in this case an externally fired gas turbine. The results show that the extracted wood chips would serve very well as a fuel for combustion and gasification processes due to the relatively high heating value. Most important, the extracted wood chips had low ash content and significantly lower concentrations of alkali metals. In addition a fermentable stream with a xylose concentration of 65 g/L was produced. The second part of this thesis was to optimise the production of the dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, which can be produced via bioconversion as a renewable building block molecule for production of biodegradable solvents and polyesters. In this study the E. coli strain AFP 184, which can ferment both five and six carbon sugars with a limited production of other organic acids was used. Earlier work using a high initial sugar concentration resulted in volumetric productivities of almost 3 g/L h, which is above estimated values for economically feasible production, and final succinic acid concentration was around 40 g/L. To further increase succinic acid concentrations, fermentations using NH 4 OH, NaOH, KOH, K 2 CO 3, and Na 2 CO 3 as neutralising agents were performed and compared. It was shown that substantial improvements could be made by using alkali bases to neutralise the fermentations. The highest concentrations and productivities were achieved when Na 2 CO 3 was used, 77 g/L and 3 g/L h, respectively. A gradual decrease in succinate productivity was observed during the fermentations, which was shown to be due to succinate accumulation in the broth and not {{as a result of the}} addition of neutralising agent or the subsequent increase in osmolarity.
