40|$|Experimental {{determinations}} of {{the dynamics}} of photoinduced electron transfer from rubrene to duroquinone in three solvents, <b>dibutyl</b> phthalate, diethyl <b>sebacate,</b> and cyclohexanone are presented. Measurements of the donor (rubrene) fluorescence decays were made with time-correlated single-photon counting. The data are analyzed using recent theoretical developments that include important features of the solvent, i. e., the effects of finite molecular volume on local solvent structure and on the mutual donor-acceptor diffusion rates. Inclusion of the liquid radial distribution function (rdf) in the theory accounts for the significant variation of the acceptor concentration near a donor. Because the concentration of acceptors near a donor is substantially greater than the average concentration used in a featureless continuum liquid model, incorporating the rdf is necessary to properly analyze experimental data. Hydrodynamic effects, which slow the rate of donoracceptor approach at short distance, are important and are also included in the theoretical analysis of the data. The data analysis depends on a reasonable model of the rdf. A hard-sphere liquid rdf is shown to be sufficiently accurate by comparing model electron-transfer calculations using a hard-sphere rdf and an rdf from neutronscattering experiments reported in the literature. A method is presented to obtain the hard-sphere parameters needed to calculate the rdf. The method uses a self-consistent determination of the hard-sphere radius and diffusion constant and the solvent self-diffusion constant calculated from the Spernol and Wirtz equation...|$|R

50|$|This distinct-smelling, reddish-orange, oily {{liquid is}} a mixture of three {{synthetic}} substances: propylene glycol dinitrate (the major component), 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate.</b> It does not need exposure to any oxidant to ignite and release energy, as its three components will react among themselves whenever vaporised and heated. Needing no oxidants and being a stable substance makes Otto Fuel II ideal for use in the constrained environment of a submarine. Although the fuel can be made to explode, this requires extreme conditions (such that it can be regarded as practically stable). The vapour pressure of the fuel is low (i.e., it is not volatile), minimising toxic hazards. Finally, the fuel's energy density far surpasses the capacity of the electric battery used in other torpedoes, maximising range.|$|E
50|$|Geldanamycin was back-extracted from {{capsules}}. <b>Dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> capsules were disposable because {{liquid core}} {{came out from}} capsules in the back-extraction. On the contrary oleic acid remained in capsules during the back-extraction when an extractant was saturated with oleic acid.

Oleic acid was removed because it prevents crystallization of geldanamycin. Therefore geldanamycin was crystallized and the end product was highly purified. Enzymes can be immobilized to the capsule membrane. In this case the capsule external diameter was 500 µm and internal diameter 300 µm. The product of enzyme-catalyzed reaction can be concentrated to capsules and the end-product inhibition is low. Enzyme recycling could be performed by back-extracting the product.

The blends were prepared by mixing varying percentages by weight of IPN with less viscous n-heptane, as well as highly viscous desensitizer <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DBS). Ignition was achieved by using a heated 60 mu m Nichrome wire. The dependence of the burning rate constant of pure IPN on initial droplet diameter was investigated in the droplet size range of 0. 79 - 1. 97 mm. The blended IPN {{studies were carried out}} with initial droplet diameters of 2 and 1. 5 mm for IPN-n-heptane and IPN-DBS blends respectively, to characterize the effect of gravimetric composition. The experiments revealed a strong dependence of IPN burning rate on droplet size. The IPN-DBS blends were characterized by severe micro-explosions, further atomizing the droplet, governed by the preferential evaporation of IPN over DBS. However, micro-explosions were conspicuously absent in case of IPN-n-heptane blends due to simultaneous gasification of both components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Thickness, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, drug content, moisture content and water absorption studies of the patches were measured. In vitro release/permeation of CPM was studied using a modified Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. Chemical enhancers like l-menthol, oleic acid and phospholipon 80 were added to compare the release pattern of the drug. The percent release of the drug from matrix patch increased with higher amounts of PVP and plasticizers, but the tensile strength decreased.

The effect of film-forming polymer (hydrophilic: hydroxypropyl cellulose (Klucel™ LF); hydrophobic: polymethacrylate copolymers (Eudragit® NE and Eudragit® RS), and polyacrylate copolymer (Dermacryl® 79) was first determined, and then the impact of incorporation of plasticisers (triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate)</b> was examined. The Klucel film released a significantly higher amount of BMV than the hydrophobic FFS, 42 versus 4 μg/cm 2, respectively. The release was increased when a plasticiser was incorporated, and with higher enhancement ratios achieved with the more lipophilic plasticisers. In conclusion, the results show that FFSs can sustain drug release (hence representing useful systems for prolonged dermal therapy) and emphasise the importance of the formulation on drug delivery, with the type of polymer being of greatest significance...|$|E

40|$|Ethyl {{cellulose}} (EC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important coating materials for controlled release formulations. To achieve the desirable drug release, the physical properties of EC films incorporated with various functional additives need to be fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this project is to characterize the physical properties of EC films incorporated with various plasticizers and pore forming agents, hence to understand the drug release mechanisms in relation to the physical characteristics of EC films. The thermal properties of EC powder and EC films were initially characterized by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Subsequently, oleic acid (OA), <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DBS) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) were incorporated as plasticizers while hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) was utilized as the pore forming agent. The thermal, thermo-mechanical and phase distribution of EC films incorporated with plasticizers and/or HPMC were investigated using MTDSC, DMA and localized thermal analysis (LTA). These results were compared with the thermal properties and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the free films after immersion into water, pH 1. 2 and 6. 8 buffers. Dissolution of metoprolol succinate and paracetamol from SureSpheres® pellets coated by these films were then carried out. OA and DBS were more efficient than MCT for EC films. OA and DBS showed good compatibility with EC, whereas at 20...|$|E
40|$|Damar Batu (DB) {{looks like}} stone with black or dark brown color inside. Due to its film forming ability {{it is used}} in the {{manufacture}} of paper, wood, varnishes, lacquers, polishes and additives for beverages. In the present study the permeability of free films of DB casted from chloroform solution containing differrent plasticizers was studied with a view to developing a suitable rate controlling membrane for transdermal use. The free films of DB were prepared by a mercury substrate technique and <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> (DBS), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and propylene glycol (PG) were tried as plasticizers. DB films were then evaluated for uniformity of thickness, moisture absorption, water vapour transmission, tensile strength, percentage elongation and folding endurance. Permeability characteristics of free films of DB were studied using diltiazem hydrochloride (DH) as a model drug. Little variation in film thickness ensured the uniformity of the films. DBS produces tough DB films with more tensile strength. Drug diffusion through the free films followed zero order kinetics. The films plasticized with PEG 400 showed higher permeability for DH compared with other films. The order of decrease of permeability of plasticized films with plasticizers was PEG 400 > PG > DBP > DBS. Diffusion of drugs through the free films of DB was extended {{over a longer period of}} time at a controlled rate. DB seems to be a promising rate controlling membrane for the transdermal application...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to prepare push–pull osmotic tablets (PPOT) of felodipine using an interpolymer complex of chitosan (CS) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as an osmopolymer, and to study the mechanisms of drug release from these tablets. The interpolymer complexes were prepared with different weight ratios of CS to PAA. Preparation of PPOT involved the fabrication of bilayered tablets with the drug layer, containing felodipine, polyethylene oxide, and the polymeric expansion layer, containing the CS–PAA complex. The effects of polymer ratios, type of plasticizers, and compression forces on release characteristics were investigated. It was found that drug release from PPOT exhibited zero-order kinetics and could be prolonged up to 12 or 24  h depending on the plasticizer used. PPOT using <b>dibutyl</b> <b>sebacate</b> showed a longer lag time and slower drug release than that using polyethylene glycol 400. In the case of polyethylene glycol 400, an increase in the CS proportion resulted in an increase in the drug release rate. The compression force had no effect on drug release from PPOT. Drug release was controlled by two consecutive mechanisms: an osmotic pump effect resulting in the extrusion of the drug layer from the tablet and subsequent erosion and dissolution of the extruded drug layer in the dissolution medium. The mathematical model (zero-order) related to extrusion and erosion rates for describing the mechanism of drug release showed a good correlation between predicted and observed values...|$|E
