Unfortunately, {{when the}} algorithm operates in error prone environments similar to wireless, {{the performance of}} the compressor drops to below that of not using <b>header</b> <b>compression.</b> This work describe modifications to the VJ algorithm that allow it to better tolerate errors. By removing many of the dependencies that are implicitly transmitted on the link, one is able to generate a noise tolerant VJ compressor. On noiseless links, the new algorithm shows similar performance as the original algorithm. On random or burst error channels, the new algorithm significantly outperform the original. 1 Introduction Transport <b>protocol</b> <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> can significantly improve the performance of low [...] bandwidth connections.

However, in certain scenario {{and in particular}} with small slice sizes, there is significant redundancy in form of overheads in the existing coding standards MPEG- 4 and H. 264. A similar idea of shortened NAL unit header has been recently proposed in the JVT meeting [1]. For small NALU sizes, the overheads may occupy {{more than half of}} the video data. Furthermore, large header information renders the video more susceptible to channel errors. This paper presents a new approach to video compression that removes most of the problems associated with the excess syntax. It takes inspiration from <b>protocol</b> <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> schemes [2]. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, H. 264 headers are analysed, and an H. 264 <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme is tested using a simulated UMTS channel. The results show up to 5 dBs gain in video quality can be achieved using the proposed scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|Internet growing, <b>compression</b> of <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IP) <b>headers</b> is seen {{as crucial}} to maximally utilize scarce {{wireless}} bandwidth. The traditional IP compression schemes rely on consistent per-flow state in order to perform <b>header</b> <b>compression.</b> See for instance [1], [2], [3]. While these approaches focus on compression gain, i. e., {{the reduction in the}} number of header bytes as a percentage of the total packet size, the overhead is the cost of managing state per each unidirectional flow. In this document we present a new <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme with the emphasis on reducing or even eliminating the state, perhaps at the cost of reduced compression gain compared to the existing methods. We make use of existing route table information in order to achieve the state reduction. The net result is that significant compression gain can be achieved at a greatly reduced cost of maintaining and managing per-flow state information.

Real time voice services will continue to be dominant in future cellular systems and to reduce system costs it is desirable to base all services, including voice, on IP. However, the radio spectrum must be efficiently used to provide mass-market services at reasonable prices, but <b>Internet</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>headers</b> are large in size. Moreover, data discarding policies are poorly suited to the error-proneness of cellular links. Protocol overhead for IP-based voice services can be reduced by compressing headers, e. g. with the compressed real time protocol (CRTP). CRTP, however, does not perform well over cellular links since it is not robust in the face of errors. ROCCO, a <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme suitable for cellular systems, delivers more packets to the user than CRTP at realistic error rates with a better average compression ratio. Voice services in cellular systems should also be able to use damaged speech data. This can be done using the UDP Lite protocol which provides a more flexible checksumming policy that enables delivery of data possibly usable to the application. This paper shows that CRTP/UDP fails to deliver sufficient service quality at the error rates of a cost-efficient cellular system and that ROCCO combined with UDP Lite can provide an IP-based voice service over such cellular systems.

40|$|Compressing <b>protocol</b> <b>headers</b> has {{traditionally}} been an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over low-speed links, including those in wireless systems. However, despite the growth {{in recent years in}} the number of end-to-end <b>protocols</b> beyond TCP/IP, <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> deployment for these protocols has not kept pace. This is in large part due to complexities in implementation, which often requires a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack of a common way of pursuing the general problem across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address this, rather than defining several new protocol-specific standards, we present a unified framework for <b>header</b> <b>compression.</b> This framework includes a simple, platform-independent header description language that protocol implementors can use to describe high-level header properties, and a platform-specific code generation tool that produces kernel source code automatically from this header specification.

Since then the field has matured, standard links have emerged, and IP has evolved. In this paper, we present the design of a complete IPv 6 -based network architecture for wireless sensor networks. We validate the architecture with a production-quality implementation that incorporates many techniques pioneered in the sensor network community, including duty-cycled link <b>protocols,</b> <b>header</b> <b>compression,</b> hop-by-hop forwarding, and efficient routing with effective link estimation. In addition to providing interoperability with existing IP devices, this implementation was able to achieve an average duty-cycle of 0. 65 %, average per-hop latency of 62 ms, and a data reception rate of 99. 98 % over a period of 4 weeks in a real-world home-monitoring application where each node generates one application packet per minute. Our results outperform existing systems that do not adhere to any particular standard or architecture. In light of this demonstration of full IPv 6 capability, we review the central arguments that led the field away from IP. We believe that the presence of an architecture, specifically an IPv 6 -based one, provides a strong foundation for wireless sensor networks going forward...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} several different <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> techniques. The different techniques included are: (1) Van Jacobson's <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> (RFC 1144); (2) SCPS (Space Communications <b>Protocol</b> Standards) <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> (SCPS-TP, SCPS-NP); (3) Robust <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> (ROHC); and (4) The <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> techniques in RFC 2507 and RFC 2508. The methodology for compression and error correction for these schemes are described {{in the remainder of}} this document. All of the <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> schemes support compression over simplex links, provided that the end receiver has some means of sending data back to the sender. However, if that return path does not exist, then neither Van Jacobson's nor SCPS can be used, since both rely on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). In addition, under link conditions of low delay and low error, all of the schemes perform as expected. However, based on the methodology of the schemes, each scheme is likely to behave differently as conditions degrade. Van Jacobson's <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> relies heavily on the TCP retransmission timer and would suffer an increase in loss propagation should the link possess a high delay and/or bit error rate (BER). The SCPS <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme protects against high delay environments by avoiding delta encoding between packets. Thus, loss propagation is avoided. However, SCPS is still affected by an increased BER (bit-error-rate) since the lack of delta encoding results in larger header sizes. Next, the schemes found in RFC 2507 and RFC 2508 perform well for non-TCP connections in poor conditions. RFC 2507 performance with TCP connections is improved by various techniques over Van Jacobson's, but still suffers a performance hit with poor link properties. Also, RFC 2507 offers the ability to send TCP data without delta encoding, similar to what SCPS offers. ROHC is similar to the previous two schemes, but adds additional CRCs (cyclic redundancy check) into <b>headers</b> and improves <b>compression</b> schemes which provide better tolerances in conditions with a high BER...|$|R

High-Quality TV over Internet is a service offered by many companies in many countries, and video streaming websites {{are within the}} most popular sites on the Internet. Because of that, service providers have a major concern in giving to their customers the best quality in their services. In order to guarantee the quality on these services, a Quality of Experience monitoring tool is required. The main goal of this thesis {{is to develop a}} tool to monitor the Quality of Experience of video over Internet services. In order to be functional, this monitoring tool has to be usable in a real scenario. In this case, a real scenario implies that this tool is used in strategic points of the network and the only available means is the data stream that goes through the network. The most important feature of this tool is {{that it has to be}} functional in real-time. It has to be so because its goal is to detect problems before these affect the quality of the video offered to the customers and avoid their complaints. In this thesis a lightweight method to monitor the Quality of Experiences is implemented. It is designed to predict in a fast way the quality of the video using only the data stream: information in the <b>Internet</b> <b>protocols</b> <b>headers</b> and in the coded video data. In order to achieve this, the structure of the packets has been studied, including the format of the <b>protocols</b> <b>headers</b> and the video codec encoding performance. Then the software has been designed to receive the stream and calculate the parameters that give an estimation of the Quality of experience. This method has been tested to validate its performance and conclude whether it is or not a valid tool to be used in a real scenario or not...|$|R

Wireless VoIP is poised to rival VoIP as an alternative telephony tool. Internet {{has been used to}} transport data in the form of packet. In the past, Internet did not support any kind of sophisticated quality of service (QoS) mechanism. Although the type of service (TOS) field in the <b>Internet</b> <b>protocol</b> (IP) <b>header</b> has been existing and has been allowing the differentiated treatment of packets, it was never really used on a large scale.

40|$|TCP/IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> {{has long}} been used to send {{information}} efficiently and to improve the response time of communication systems. The wide deployment of the new <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol,</b> IPv 6, puts more demands on <b>header</b> <b>compression,</b> since IPv 6 normally yields packets with much larger headers than IPv 4 does. At the same time, <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> is necessary on wireless links, which are always considered relatively limited resources. However, packets sent over wireless channels are prone to be corrupted.

40|$|NASA {{is moving}} toward a networkcentric {{communications}} architecture and, in particular, is building toward use of <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IP) in space. The use of IP is motivated by its ubiquitous application in many communications networks and in available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology. The Constellation Program intends to fit two or more voice (over IP) channels on both the forward link to, and the return link from, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) during all mission phases. Efficient bandwidth utilization of the links is key for voice applications. In Voice over IP (VoIP), the IP packets are limited to small sizes to keep voice latency at a minimum. The common voice codec used in VoIP is G. 729. This new algorithm produces voice audio at 8 kbps and in packets of 10 -milliseconds duration. Constellation has designed the VoIP communications stack to use the combination of IP/UDP/RTP protocols where IP carries a 20 -byte header, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) carries an 8 -byte header, and RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol) carries a 12 -byte <b>header.</b> The <b>protocol</b> <b>headers</b> total 40 bytes and are equal in length to a 40 -byte G. 729 payload, doubling the VoIP latency. Since much of the IP/UDP/RTP header information does not change from IP packet to IP packet, IP/UDP/RTP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> can avoid transmission of much redundant data as well as reduce VoIP latency. The benefits of IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> are more pronounced at low data rate links such as the forward and return links during CEV launch. IP/UDP/RTP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> codecs are well supported by many COTS routers. A common interface to the COTS routers is through frame relay. However, enabling IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> over frame relay, according to industry standard (Frame Relay IP <b>Header</b> <b>Compression</b> Agreement FRF. 20), requires a duplex link and negotiations between the compressor router and the decompressor router. In Constellation, each forward to and return link from the CEV in space is treated independently as a simplex link. Without negotiation, the COTS routers are prevented from entering into the IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> mode, and no IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> would be performed. An algorithm is proposed to enable IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> in COTS routers on a simplex link with no negotiation or with a one-way messaging. In doing so, COTS routers can enter IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> mode without the need to handshake through a bidirectional link as required by FRF. 20. This technique would spoof the routers locally and thereby allow the routers to enter into IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> mode without having the negotiations between routers actually occur. The spoofing function is conducted by a frame relay adapter (also COTS) with the capability to generate control messages according to the FRF. 20 descriptions. Therefore, negotiation is actually performed between the FRF. 20 adapter and the connecting COTS router locally and never occurs over the space link. Through understanding of the handshaking protocol described by FRF. 20, the necessary FRF. 20 negotiations messages can be generated to control the connecting router, not only to turn on IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> but also to adjust the compression parameters. The FRF. 20 negotiation (or control) message is composed in the FRF. 20 adapter by interpreting the incoming router request message. Many of the fields are simply transcribed from request to response while the control field indicating response and type are modified...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents {{a method for}} countering Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in networks that provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees using Differentiated Service (DiffServ). This approach uses feedback from the DiffServ provider to initiate packet signing at the source. The signature allows the DiffServ provider to distinguish valid packets from malicious packets. This mechanism {{can also be used}} to provide key management for other digital signature methods, such as the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> Authentication <b>Header</b> (IP AH). However, unlike other methods, our solution requires no encryption or cryptographic processing on a per-packet basis. Instead, it utilizes the sender's ability to alter its packet signatures faster than the attacker can duplicate the changes. This method also avoids the fragmentation and decreased throughput associated with increased packet size of IP AH through use of existing fields in the IP header. This method results in a significant reduction in valid packets that are dropped during a DoS attack. Thus, a DiffServ provider would be able to maintain QoS guarantees during an attack without incurring the overhead associated with cryptographic signatures. A C++ implementation of this DoS countermeasure for the ns 2 network simulator and the experimental simulation scripts are included as appendices. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|TCP/IP <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> {{has long}} been used to send {{information}} efficiently and to improve the response time of communication systems. It is also well known that errors on the link where <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> is used can deteriorate the performance. In addition, the recently noticed high frequency of some computer networking problems can make the performance of <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> even worse. These problems include packet reordering and packet errors that avoid link layer error detection. In this paper, we analyze the influence of these problems on existing <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> algorithms. We also propose an adaptive <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> that gives better performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an cooperative <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme for 4 G wireless networks. The main focus {{is to achieve}} robustness and low complexity for the <b>compression.</b> Furthermore the <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> scheme should work without any feedback information. Index Terms—cooperative behavior, <b>header</b> <b>compression,</b> future wireless system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Header</b> <b>Compression</b> {{techniques}} are now {{widely used in}} wireless and satellite communications. The main drawback of these techniques is to weaken the transmission against bit error or packet losses. Indeed, a corrupted or missing header {{can lead to a}} non-decompression of consecutive packets and then to a disconnection until the reception of a non-compressed packet. The parameters of the <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> system should then be carefully determined. In this paper, we first review the main <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> <b>protocols</b> standardized for a unidirectional link. This analysis allows us to build a simple generic <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> model depending on few parameters characterizing a <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> <b>protocol.</b> The evaluation of this model in cases corresponding to particular applications allows us to draw some first lessons for the use of <b>header</b> <b>compression</b> in Satellite communications...|$|R
