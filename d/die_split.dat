40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} approach to object tracking {{which allows for}} paths to merge together or split apart. Paths are also allowed to be born, die, and go undetected for several frames. The splitting and merging of paths is a novel addition for a statistically-based tracking algorithm. This addition is essential for storm tracking, which is the motivation for this work. The utility of this tracker extends well beyond the tracking of storms however. It can be valuable in other tracking applications that have splitting or merg-ing, such as vortices, radar/sonar signals, or groups of people. The method assumes that the location of an object behaves like a Gaus-sian Process when it is observable. Objects are required to be born, <b>die,</b> <b>split,</b> or merge according to a Markov State Model. Path cor-respondence is achieved by an algorithm that finds the paths that maximize {{the likelihood of the}} assumed model. 1...|$|E

50|$|A {{crosshead}} <b>die</b> <b>splits</b> {{the melt}} flow in {{two at the}} manifold inlet, recombining them at {{the opposite side of}} a cylindrical center mandrel. This relatively simple design results in non-symmetrical flow, as molecules take longer to reach the opposite side than the close side of the mandrel. As such, the resulting film will not be of uniform thickness. To reduce this nonuniformity, inlet diameters can be varied, and various inserts can be added to minimize stagnant regions.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the process}} {{involves}} relatively low forces (ranging from 5 to 50 kN {{depending on the}} material to join, type of tools and sheet thicknesses), clinching generally involves reduced size (often portable) machines. The tools typically consist of a punch and a die. Different tools have been developed so far, which can be classified in round and rectangular tools. Round clinching tools include: fixed grooved <b>dies,</b> <b>split</b> <b>dies</b> (with 2-4 movable sectors) and flat dies. Such tools produce round joints which show almost identical mechanical behaviors in all plane directions. When round tools are adopted, {{the integrity of the}} sheet in the joint must be guaranteed in order to preserve a good mechanical behavior of the joints.|$|R

40|$|In {{aluminium}} extrusion processes, friction inside the bearing channel {{is important for}} controlling the surface quality of the extrusion products. The contact materials show a large hardness difference, one being hot aluminium, and the other being hardened tool steel. Further, the contact pressure is high, which means that contact at the bearing–aluminium interface is fully plastic. A load dependent fully plastic friction model has been developed for such fully plastic contact conditions. This roughness based contact model is applied on the mesoscopic scale to calculate the length stick- and slip zones in the bearing–extrudate interface. Further, <b>split</b> <b>die</b> {{aluminium extrusion}} experiments have been performed to validate the model. The sticking/slipping length as an indicator for friction has been measured and compared to {{the results from the}} model. Results show that the model is in good agreement with the <b>split</b> <b>die</b> extrusion experiment...|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{the choice}} of the {{clinching}} tools highly affects the joining strength and the absorbed energy of a clinched connection other than the joining force.

2500|$|... is the deuteragonist of the game. Kid loathes Lynx for {{initially}} undisclosed reasons, {{and helps}} to defend Serge from Lynx's pursuit efforts against him. While they team up due to shared involvement with Lynx, various choices by the player, and certain required plot points, shorten or lengthen the time they work together. Late in the game, its revealed that she is actually a cloned version of Schala from Chrono Trigger, who had fallen into an area beyond time and space following {{the events of the}} prior game. There, she was trapped and fused with Lavos, the antagonist of Chrono Trigger, but was still able to observe the rest of the world. Schala observed Serge about to drown as a child, created the storm that save his life by directing him to the healing powers of the Frozen Flame, and then created a clone of herself to send back to reality to find Serge. The clone-baby, Kid, is found by Lucca, who raises her in her orphanage. Kid hates Lynx because he raided Lucca's orphanage, abducting Lucca and leaving Kid homeless, leaving her to fend for herself as a child on her own, leading to the brash exterior person she is for much of the course of the game. Kid is also the reason why there are two dimensions in the game; she traveled in time to save Serge from <b>dying,</b> <b>splitting</b> the world into two, one where Serge lives, and one where he had died.|$|R

The band was later renamed Depp Jones, named after a character in the German version of the comic book series Lucky Luke. Their 1990 debut LP, Return to Caramba!, failed to capitalise on the popularity of Die Ärzte, and its follow-ups Welcome to Hell and At 2012 A.D. did even worse. Farin Urlaub's new band, King Køng, also struggled, and in 1993 he and Bela B. agreed to reform Die Ärzte, with former Depp Jones guitarist Rodrigo González joining them on bass.|$|R
40|$|The FluidForming {{technology}} {{represents an}} alternative {{sheet metal forming}} approach {{as compared to the}} traditional, bladder based hydroforming, metal spinning, and sheet metal stamping processes. The machine construction allows for much higher forming pressures of up to 400 [*]MPa/ 60, 000 psi. The technology also enables material flow into the dies, thus, providing more material in potentially critical areas. Modular die construction allows for very cost effective solutions including plastic dies, 3 D printed dies, <b>die</b> nesting, and <b>split</b> <b>dies.</b> This approach, in-turn, allows undercuts in the parts and generates scratch- and mostly distortion-free parts from pre-painted, pre-patterned, and pre-polished materials like AL, SS, CU, TI or any of the new high performance alloys. As a result, the technology enables a new product development approach that can focus on optimization and/or Time-to-Market while maintaining or lowering the overall Cost-to-Market. In fact, the development cycle can be accelerated to be less than a week from the CAD design to the production of highly accurate, repeatable metal parts that may not even be manufacturable with other technologies...|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Swaminarayan, the movement gained strength, {{and at the time}} of his death it had 1.8 million followers. The organisation is based on vedic and puritic Hinduism. Apart from traditional Hindu scriptures, the sect has more than three thousand works written by its members. The most important are the Shikshapatri and the Vachanamrut. The Shikshapatri, which the Bombay Gazetteer described as a book of social principles, was written by Swaminarayan in 1826. [...] Before Swaminarayan <b>died,</b> he <b>split</b> the administration of the Swaminarayan Sampraday into two seats for his two adopted sons: the Nar Narayan Dev Gadi (gadi means seat) is headquartered in Ahmedabad and the Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi is headquartered in Vadtal.
