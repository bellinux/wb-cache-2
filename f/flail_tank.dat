Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine <b>flail</b> <b>tank</b> finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer.

B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt to take out a field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E

The first wave on King was the 5th East Yorkshires and 6th Green Howards of 69th Brigade, assisted by amphibious DD tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards. The 7th Green Howards landed at 08:20. The original plan called for the 38 DD tanks to be launched from their landing craft tank (LCTs) about [...] out. Due to extremely choppy seas, they decided to run the tanks directly onto the beach. Infantry, engineers, and DD tanks arrived almost simultaneously. Units disembarking onto the beach immediately came under fire from the casemated 88mm gun at La Rivière, and the infantry were forced to take cover behind the sea wall. The gun was taken out when a <b>flail</b> <b>tank</b> of the Westminster Dragoons fired a charge directly into its aperture.

50|$|The Sherman Crab was a mine <b>flail</b> <b>tank</b> {{designed}} {{to clear a}} safe path through a mine-field by deliberately detonating mines {{in front of the}} vehicle. The Crab design was first used by the British during the North African Campaign. The Sherman Crab was a standard Sherman tank with the mine flail mechanism added.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the ideas}} had already been tried, tested or were in {{experimental}} development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion <b>flail</b> <b>tank</b> (a modified Matilda tank) had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine-rollers. Close-support tanks, bridgelayers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were {{the largest and most}} elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available.|$|E

50|$|During the battle, the Scorpions {{were less}} {{successful}} than hoped. While reasonably effective at mine clearing, the hastily developed flail system was unreliable and broke down frequently. Also, there were frequent engine failures, {{as the air}} filters were overwhelmed by the volume of dust produced by flailing or the engines overheated because of the desert environment. Much of the mine clearing that was critical to the Commonwealth victory still had {{to be carried out}} by hand. One unexpected effect was that the noise, dust and terrifying appearance of an approaching <b>flail</b> <b>tank</b> caused several Axis infantry units to surrender without resistance.|$|E
50|$|In north-west Europe, Crabs were {{operated}} by the Lothians and Border Horse, the 22nd Dragoons and the Westminster Dragoons, {{all of whom were}} part of the 79th Armoured Division's 30th Armoured Brigade; in Italy, they were {{operated by}} the 51st Royal Tank Regiment. A flail squadron of the Royal Armoured Corps, as established on 29 March 1944, comprised seven ordinary Shermans (squadron HQ and a four-tank pilot troop) and four troops of four flail-equipped tanks. In July 1944, the new establishment removed the pilot troop and one of the flail troops; on the plus side, the squadron gained an armoured recovery vehicle. In 1945, in light of experience, each gained a fifth <b>flail</b> <b>tank.</b> Scorpion regiments had been formed of three flail troops.|$|E

50|$|In combat, {{the usual}} tactic {{was to use}} Crabs in groups of five. Three would go forward in echelon formation, {{clearing}} a broad path through the minefield. The other two would hang back on the flanks and give fire support, but were ready to move forward to replace one of the <b>flailing</b> <b>tanks</b> if it was disabled.The Crab had disadvantages; flailing did not remove all mines. A Teller mine buried up to 5 in deep would be set off, but the resulting explosion would destroy a single flail chain, which {{would have to be}} replaced at some point.|$|R
50|$|On 3 December, 49 APCR {{took part}} in Operation Guildford, the assault on Blerick, a heavily defended suburb of the Dutch town of Venlo. The Kangaroos {{advanced}} behind a creeping barrage along lanes cut through the minefields and anti-tank ditch by <b>flail</b> <b>tanks</b> and bridgelaying tanks. They delivered the attacking infantry (8th Battalion Royal Scots and 6th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers) close to their objectives and, although some Kangaroos were disabled by mines, the squadrons returned for two more battalions. In {{the words of the}} Official History, 'from that point the taking of the town proved to be a walk-over'.|$|R
50|$|To {{deal with}} the {{successive}} enemy lines of defences anticipated in the later stages of the campaign, it was decided late in 1944 to convert 25th Tank Brigade into 25th Assault Engineer Brigade, equipped with specialised armour ('funnies'. Organised on 5 January 1945, this was primarily a Royal Engineers formation, but 51 RTR remained in the brigade and was also converted to specialised armour. 'B' Squadron received 15 Crab Mark II <b>flail</b> <b>tanks,</b> while 'A' and 'C' sqns had a total of 32 Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks. Each squadron in the brigade was self-administering, {{so that they could}} be detached where required.|$|R
50|$|With the {{assistance}} of specialist units from the 79th Armoured Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment, such as Kangaroos and Sherman Crab vehicles, {{the first part of}} the assault proceeded swiftly, with gaps cleared through the minefield and anti-tank ditches breached. The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division penetrated the north-eastern section of the Le Havre perimeter first, followed by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacking on their right from the north. The assault was costly for the specialised armour, however, with the 79th Armoured Division losing 34 Crab anti-mine <b>flail</b> <b>tanks,</b> two command tanks and 6 AVRE vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Gueritz's {{immediate}} {{task was}} {{to solve the problem}} of vehicles becoming stuck in the soft sand, and to start getting men through the exits being cleared through the minefields and barbed wire by <b>flail</b> <b>tanks.</b> To add to his problems, a further brigade came ashore at 0930, only to find that high winds were driving the tide higher than expected, reducing the space available on the beach and pushing the landing craft on to the explosive obstacles left by the Germans. Despite all this by the evening of D-Day 30,000 troops, hundreds of vehicles and tons of ammunition and other supplies had been landed and moved through the beach area.|$|R
50|$|All three regiments of the 30th Armoured Brigade were re-equipped with Sherman Crab <b>Flail</b> <b>Tanks</b> - M4 Sherman tanks {{modified}} by attaching a large jib, covered in chains, {{to the front}} of the vehicle. The idea being that the tanks would clear a path through a minefield by slowly driving along flogging the ground ahead of them and, hopefully, exploding the mines; to be effective, the tanks had to drive at no more than one and half miles per hour. Tank units thus equipped were not generally used as entire regiments, rather they were split up into troop or squadron-sized formations in support of organised set piece attacks.|$|R
50|$|After {{a period}} of maintenance, 107 RAC was {{temporarily}} attached to 31st Tank Brigade (part of 79th Armoured Division, equipped with specialist armour) and on 3 December went into action at Blerick in support of 15th (Scottish) Division in XII Corps. This well-planned and executed Corps attack on this heavily defended suburb of the Dutch town of Venlo (Operation Guildlford), was accompanied by strong artillery and Typhoon support, preceded by <b>flail</b> <b>tanks</b> to breach minefields, bridge-laying AVREs to cross an anti-tank ditch, and with a well-executed cover plan that misled the enemy as to the direction from which the attack would come. The objectives were achieved with remarkably few casualties.|$|R
50|$|To {{deal with}} the {{successive}} enemy lines of defences anticipated in the later stages of the campaign, it was decided in late 1944 to convert the brigade into the 25th Assault Engineer Brigade, equipped with the specialized tanks known as Hobart's Funnies. Organised on 5 January 1945, this was primarily a Royal Engineers formation, but 51 RTR remained in the brigade, although converted to specialised armour. 'B' Squadron received 15 Crab Mark II <b>flail</b> <b>tanks,</b> while 'A' and 'C' sqns had a total of 32 Churchill Crocodile flamethrowing tanks. Each squadron in the brigade was self-administering, {{so that they could}} be detached where required.|$|R
50|$|By early September, the {{regiment}} was sufficiently reorganised {{to take part}} in Operation Astonia, the attack on Le Havre. On 11 September, 107 RAC attacked in support of 147th Brigade of 49th (West Riding) Division, attacking the high ground on the North East side of the port. The tanks picked their way through lanes cut through the minefields by <b>flail</b> <b>tanks</b> and went on to assist the infantry in mopping up machine gun positions and (with some Churchill Crocodile flamethrowers under command) to clear buildings. The following day, 107 RAC's tanks took up hull-down positions on the high ground and gave fire support to the infantry advance on the town, which fell later that day.|$|R
50|$|Gold BeachOn Gold Beach, {{the sea was}} rougher. The {{tanks of}} the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry were {{launched}} late, about 700 yd from the shore. Eight tanks were lost {{on the way in}} {{and by the time the}} remainder landed, Sherman Crab (mine <b>flail)</b> <b>tanks</b> had already destroyed the German artillery and machine-gun positions that would have been their objective. Sea conditions meant the tanks of ‘B’ and ‘C’ Squadrons, from the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards were landed in the shallows. They then drove onto the beach with their screens up so they would not get swamped in the breakers. German anti-tank guns caused heavy losses in some sectors of the beach but the assault was successful.|$|R
50|$|The 3rd British Infantry Division was {{the first}} British {{formation}} to land at Sword Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, {{as part of the}} invasion of Normandy, part of the larger Operation Overlord. For the assault landing, 3rd British Division was organised as a Division Group, with other formations temporarily under its command. These included 27th Armoured Brigade (Sherman DD amphibious tanks) and 22nd Dragoons (Sherman Crab <b>flail</b> <b>tanks),</b> 1st Special Service Brigade and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, 5th Royal Marine Independent Armoured Support Battery (Centaur IV close support tanks), 77 and 79 Assault Squadrons of 5th Assault Regiment, Royal Engineers (Churchill AVREs), plus additional Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and Royal Army Service Corps personnel.|$|R

On the right, The Highland Light Infantry of Canada (HLI) would attack the two northern batteries, the Grosser Kurfurst (sited on the cape) and Gris Nez (sited at Floringzelle, about 1¼ kilometres south-east of Gris Nez); while, on the left, The North Nova Scotia Highlanders (NNS) faced Todt (sited at Haringzelles, two kilometres south of Grosser Kurfurst). The batteries were protected to landward by extensive defences, consisting of minefields, barbed wire, reinforced blockhouses and anti-tank positions.|$|R
50|$|The North Shores' {{attack on}} Noires Mottes was {{supported}} by <b>flail</b> <b>tanks</b> from the 79th Armoured Division and gunfire from the 10th Armoured Regiment on the approach through minefields and by Crocodiles to reduce fortifications. Early attempts by small groups of Germans to surrender were discouraged when they were shot down by their own side. The advance was held up, however, {{by a combination of}} effective defence and bomb craters that prevented the Crocodiles' advance before nightfall. Negotiations were opened with the help of German prisoners and the Noires Mottes garrison surrendered at first light on the following morning, 26 September. A formidable defensive position had been captured cheaply. It appears that the Sangatte battery was also surrendered at the same time. Examination of the forts showed that they had been heavily booby-trapped.|$|R
