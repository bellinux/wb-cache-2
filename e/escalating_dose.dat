40|$|Objective: Technological {{advances}} have enabled clinicians to explore dose escalation strategies in various tumor sites. Intermediate and high risk oropharyngeal cancers have poor 5 year outcomes. This study aimed {{to assess the}} feasibility and dosimetric safety of 9 % dose escalation in these tumors and compare the dose received by organs at risk (OAR) in escalated plans (67. 2 Gy/ 28 fractions) versus (65 Gy/ 30 fractions) standard dose plans. Materials and Methods: FDG-PET fused datasets were used to delineate gross, clinical and planning target volumes. Standard dose plans were created using two non IMRT techniques (conventional and field in field plans) whilst the patient was treated using a helical tomotherapy plan. A fourth dose escalation plan was obtained allowing comparison between the 20 plans of oropharyngeal cancer patients. Results: It was feasible to <b>escalate</b> <b>dose</b> to the FDG-PET avid tumor within the set constraints to that of planning target volume and OAR. Comparison of the <b>escalated</b> <b>dose</b> to that of standard plans showed a statistically significant (P < 0. 05) sparing of the mastication apparatus (MA) with <b>escalated</b> plans. <b>Dose</b> to the other critical and functional organs were comparable between the four plans. Conclusion: Hypofractionated, slightly accelerated dose escalation in oropharyngeal cancers {{is likely to be}} safe and the chance of trismus is not any higher than when standard dose radiotherapy is used. Active measures to reduce dose to the MA achieves acceptable dose volume parameters even at <b>escalated</b> <b>doses...</b>|$|R

50|$|Emergency {{treatment}} of cocaine-associated hyperthermia consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan) to enhance muscle relaxation and decrease sympathetic outflow {{from the central}} nervous system. Physical cooling is best accomplished with tepid water misting and cooling with a fan (convection and evaporation), which {{can be carried out}} easily in the field or hospital. There is no specific pharmacological antidote for cocaine overdose. The chest pain, high blood pressure, and increased heart rate caused by cocaine may be also treated with a benzodiazepine. Multiple and <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> of benzodiazepines may be necessary to achieve effect, which increases risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. A comprehensive systematic review of all pharmacological treatments of cocaine cardiovascular toxicity revealed benzodiazepines may not always reliably lower heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|By {{contrast}} uncontrolled use {{of conventional}} (<b>escalating</b> <b>dose)</b> immunotherapy (hyposensitization not EPD) for general allergic conditions {{was believed to}} be responsible for at least 29 deaths in the UK, and is now banned in the United Kingdom except in hospital under close observation. A working party of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology reviewed the role of conventional high dose specific allergen immunotherapy (not EPD) in the treatment of allergic disease and recommends high dose specific allergen immunotherapy for treating summer hay fever uncontrolled by conventional medication and for wasp and bee venom hypersensitivity. For the recommended indications the risk:benefit ratio was found to be acceptable for conventional immunotherapy provided patients are carefully selected; in particular, patients with asthma should be excluded and injections should be given only by allergists experienced in this form of treatment in a clinic where resuscitative facilities are available and patients remain symptom free for an observation period after injection which is sufficient to detect all serious adverse reactions.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{neurobiology}} of {{the transition}} from initial drug use to excessive drug use has been a challenge in drug addiction. We examined the effect of chronic 'binge' <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> cocaine administration, which mimics human compulsive drug use, on behavioural responses and the dopaminergic system of mice and compared it with a chronic steady dose (3 x 15 mg/kg/day) 'binge' cocaine administration paradigm. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were injected with saline or cocaine in an <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> paradigm for 14 days. Locomotor and stereotypy activity were measured and quantitative autoradiographic mapping of D(1) and D(2) receptors, dopamine transporters and D(2) -stimulated [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding was performed in the brains of mice treated with this escalating and steady dose paradigm. An initial sensitization to the locomotor effects of cocaine followed by a dose-dependent increase in {{the duration of the}} locomotor effect of cocaine was observed in the escalating but not the steady dose paradigm. Sensitization to the stereotypy effect of cocaine and an increase in cocaine-induced stereotypy score was observed from 3 x 20 to 3 x 25 mg/kg/day cocaine. There was a significant decrease in D(2) receptor density, but an increase in D(2) -stimulated G-protein activity and dopamine transporter density in the striatum of cocaine-treated mice, which was not observed in our steady dose paradigm.

40|$|Using a {{randomized}} study, we compared a daily and an alternate-day regimen of amphotericin B {{for the treatment}} of kala-azar, with respect to efficacy, adverse reactions, cost-effectiveness, and tolerance. The study subjects were 80 kala-azar patients, drawn from the first four decades of life and matched by age, sex, and parasite load. The patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups A and B (40 patients per group). Patients in group A received a daily regimen of amphotericin B, starting with an <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 05 mg/kg body weight per day until a daily dose of 1 mg/kg was reached; the latter dose was then given daily till a total dose of 20 mg/kg body weight had been administered.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of an extended schedule <b>escalated</b> <b>dose</b> of temozolomide versus standard dose dacarbazine in a large population of patients with stage IV melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 859 patients were randomised to receive oral temozolomide at 150 mg/m(2) /day for seven consecutive days every 2 weeks or dacarbazine, administered as an intravenous infusion at 1000 mg/m(2) /day on day 1 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), using an intent-to-treat principle. EudraCT number 2004 - 000654 - 23 NCI registration number NCT 00005052. RESULTS: Median OS was 9. 1 months in the temozolomide arm and 9. 4 months in the dacarbazine arm, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1. 00 (95 %confidence interval [CI]: 0. 86, 1. 17; P= 0. 99). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2. 3 months in the temozolomide arm and 2. 2 months in the dacarbazine arm, with a HR of 0. 92 (95 %CI: 0. 80, 1. 06; P= 0. 27). In patients with measurable disease, overall response rate was higher in the temozolomide arm than in the dacarbazine arm (14. 5 % versus 9. 8 %, respectively), but the median duration of response was longer for dacarbazine.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Topical {{application}} of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment heals chronic anal fissures, providing {{an alternative to}} the traditional first line treatment of surgical sphincterotomy.  AIMS—To determine the most effective dose of topical GTN for treatment of chronic anal fissures and to assess long term results.  METHODS—Seventy consecutive patients with chronic anal fissure, were randomly allocated to eight weeks treatment with placebo, 0. 2 % GTN three times daily, or GTN starting at 0. 2 % with weekly 0. 1 % increments to a maximum of 0. 6 %, in a double blind study.  RESULTS—After eight weeks fissure had healed in 67 % of patients treated with GTN compared with 32 % with placebo (p= 0. 008). No significant difference was seen between the two active treatments. Headaches were reported by 72 % of patients on GTN compared with 27 % on placebo (p< 0. 001). Maximum anal sphincter pressure reduced significantly from baseline by GTN treatment (p= 0. 02), but not placebo (p= 0. 8). Mean pain scores were lower after treatment with GTN compared with placebo (NS). Of fissures healed with placebo 43 % recurred, compared with 33 % of those healed with 0. 2 % GTN and 25 % healed with <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> GTN (p= 0. 7).  CONCLUSIONS—GTN is a good first line treatment for two thirds of patients with anal fissure. An <b>escalating</b> <b>dose</b> of GTN does not result in earlier healing. Significant recurrence of symptomatic fissures and a high incidence of headaches are limitations of the treatment. ...|$|E
