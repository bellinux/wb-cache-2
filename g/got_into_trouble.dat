5|$|Robinson idolized Henry Armstrong and Joe Louis as a youth, and {{actually}} {{lived on the}} same block as Louis in Detroit when Robinson was 11 and Louis was 17. Outside the ring, Robinson <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> frequently as a youth, and was involved with a violent street gang. He married at 16. The couple had one son, Ronnie, and divorced when Robinson was 19. He finished his amateur career with an 85–0 record with 69 knockouts–40 coming in the first round. He won the Golden Gloves featherweight championship in 1939, and the organization's lightweight championship in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{rebuilt the}} defence for 1993–94, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed {{start to the}} season. City won four {{straight}} home matches but also lost 5–1 to West Ham, 5–0 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4–0 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He {{found it difficult to}} control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble</b> in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor.|$|E

25|$|As the {{charterer}} {{was responsible}} for paying for the aircraft's entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, {{there was a great}} temptation to let people, who were not eligible to travel under the affinity group rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings.

25|$|When she was 10 years old, Cruzado's parents {{enrolled}} {{her in an}} all-girl {{parochial school}} in Mayaguez. After school, she returned home in her school uniform and played in the coffee mill (her clothes still smelling of fresh coffee at school the next day). She found school boring compared to her grandmother's lessons, and frequently <b>got</b> <b>into</b> <b>trouble.</b> As punishment, {{she was forced to}} read novels aloud to a blind nun. The experience taught her a love of literature which influenced her choice of major in college.

The community also suspected the brothers in the theft of a horse. The crimes caused considerable tension in the town and Wilkison and four of his sons fled, living near St. Louis, Missouri, for some time, before returning to their farm in 1860. The war broke shortly after and the brothers enlisted in hopes of escaping the angry citizens of the town.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, Burroughs began {{living with}} Joan Vollmer Adams in an {{apartment}} they shared with Jack Kerouac and Edie Parker, Kerouac's first wife.
