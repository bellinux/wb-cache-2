50|$|Tuning a {{stringed}} instrument {{such as a}} guitar to pitch puts the strings under {{a large amount of}} strain, which indicates the amount of stress inside the string. Stress is relative to the stretch or elongation of the strings. As the string is tuned to a higher pitch, it gets longer and thinner. The instrument can go out of tune because if it has been stretched past its elastic limit, it isn't going to recover its original tension. On a stress vs. strain curve, there is a linear region where stress and strain are related called Young's modulus. When you have a newer set of strings, they are often in a region on the stress vs. strain curve past the Young's modulus called the plastic region. In the plastic region, plastic deformation occurs—deformation the material cannot recover from. Thus, in the plastic region, the relationship is not linear anymore (Young's modulus is no longer a constant). The <b>elastic</b> <b>region</b> is where elastic deformation is occurring, or deformation from where the string can recover.

The curve shows three distinctive regions. For ultrasmall compressive forces (5 – 75 pN), the protein's central region shows that the strain and stress are proportional (<b>elastic</b> regime). This <b>region</b> has an average Young's modulus of 2. 5 MPa. For forces between 80 and 220 pN, the stress is roughly proportional to the strain with a Young's modulus of 9 MPa.

Plastic flow initiates at the upper yield point and continues at the lower one. At lower yield point, permanent deformation is heterogeneously distributed along the sample. The deformation band which formed at the upper yield point will propagate along the gage length at the lower yield point. The band occupies the whole of the gage at the luders strain. Beyond this point, work hardening commences. The appearance of the yield point is associated with pinning of dislocations in the system. Specifically, solid solution interacts with dislocations and acts as pin and prevent dislocation from moving. Therefore, the stress needed to initiate the movement will be large.
