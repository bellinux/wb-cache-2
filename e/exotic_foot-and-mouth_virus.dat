40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the quasispecies nature (extreme genetic heterogeneity) of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease <b>virus</b> is relevant to the virus evading an immune response. A monoclonal antibody neutralizing the viral infectivity (clone SD 6) recognizes an epitope located around a highly conserved sequence (amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Leu-Ala at positions 141 - 145) in the capsid protein VP 1 of <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease <b>virus</b> of serotype C 1. The amino acid substitutions Ala- 138 [...] Thr and Leu- 147 [...] Ile (or [...] Val) reduced 100 -fold the binding titer of monoclonal antibody SD 6 to virions or to VP 1.

The three substitutions were fixed in the viral capsid during one occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease and, furthermore, they are of a type found frequently among independent <b>foot-and-mouth</b> disease <b>virus</b> isolates.
