5000|$|The Equal <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society</b> (EFS) was a state-by-state {{organization}} that advocated for Women's suffrage in the United States. Created and joined by women of wealth, {{it was a}} conduit through which the energies of upper class women could be channeled into political activism conducted within a socially comfortable milieu. [...] The New York branch of the Society, for example, often held suffrage rallies at which members spoke in the street outside the Colony Club, to which many of them belonged. After the public rally, Club members would eat luncheon inside their Club. The EFS also invited anti-suffragists to meet with them {{for the purposes of}} debate.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Nevada {{in the fall}} of 1911, she became president of the Nevada Equal <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society</b> in February 1912 and organized a campaign over sparsely populated deserts that convinced male voters to enfranchise women on November 3, 1914. This success led to her representation of the national movement as a speaker and executive committee member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the Congressional Union. Martin helped organize voting women in the West in 1916 to challenge Democrats. She was one of the Silent Sentinels, National Woman's Party women who picketed for suffrage in front of the White House on July 14, 1917; as a result, she was sentenced to Occoquan Workhouse, but was pardoned less than a week later by President Woodrow Wilson.|$|R
5000|$|Katherine Duer Mackay {{founded the}} Equal <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society</b> (EFS) in New York City in 1908 and {{also served as}} its president. The first meeting was held at her house on December 21, where the Constitution for the group was adopted and {{officers}} were elected. Mackey later leased offices for the group's meetings in the Madison Square Building. Mackay {{had a vision of}} the EFS uniting woman's suffrage groups into a [...] "single body." [...] Her vision of EFS also included the equality of men and women both in civic and political sectors and a prohibition against militant tactics. She also hoped that both wealthy and working-class women could work together towards suffrage through the EFS. The EFS decided in 1909 to push for the right to vote in the city of New York first, before they fought for the right to vote across the country.|$|R
5000|$|Mackay {{became the}} {{president}} of the Equal <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society</b> (EFS), which she founded, in 1908. She leased offices for the group's meetings in the Madison Square Building. Mackay's involvement in the suffrage movement helped combat the stereotype of suffragists as [...] "frumpy" [...] or [...] "unwomanly."In March 1909, the EFS resolved to work towards suffrage for women in New York, hoping they could pave the way for suffrage across the country by 1914. Mackay encouraged people to become educated about suffrage and organized a series of lectures at the Garden Theater. By 1911, she found that being {{the president of}} EFS was too time consuming for her, but she retained her membership in the group. Speculation that Mackay left EFS for reasons other than demands on her time included her apparent [...] "dissatisfaction over the management of the campaign to get suffrage bills passed by the Legislature." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{active member}} of the Brighton Women's <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society,</b> she also served as Magistrate for many years on the Brighton bench, became President of the Medical Women’s Federation in 1931, was a Prison Commissioner {{and a member of the}} National Council of Women. She served with the Scottish Women’s Hospitals at Royaumont Abbey in France in World War I, and as a surgeon in London in World War II. Martindale never married and lived for more than three decades with another woman, Ismay FitzGerald (c. 1875-1946), {{daughter}} of Baron FitzGerald of Kilmarnock. Some scholars are wary of identifying Martindale as a lesbian; Geoffrey Walford, for instance, does not state whether Martindale's [...] "woman-centred lifestyle" [...] specifically entailed a lesbian relationship. Others are more explicit and unhesitatingly propose Martindale's lesbianism, referring for instance to her 1951 autobiography A Woman Surgeon, in which she writes quite openly and tenderly (though without giving explicit detail) about her love for FitzGerald.|$|R
5000|$|In 1892 Putnam {{supported}} Stevenson's {{appointment to}} the Jury of Awards for Ethnology. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Stevenson was elected {{vice president of the}} jury. In 1894 Stevenson was the first woman to speak at the Peabody Museum on [...] "Egypt at the Dawn of History". She was president of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, the Contemporary Club, and the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Archeological Institute of America and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society and the American Exploration Society. She was {{also a member of the}} Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was admitted to the American Philosophical Society. Stevenson also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895. She also established the Equal <b>Franchise</b> <b>Society</b> of Pennsylvania, in recognition of the difficulties women faced. She served as president until 1910 and first vice president until the Federal Suffrage Amendment passed in 1920.|$|R
40|$|For centuries it {{has been}} {{believed}} that {{the extension of the}} <b>franchise</b> in unequal <b>societies</b> would lead to relatively high levels of redistribution. According to international rankings, how- ever, among the fourteen most unequal countries in the world, nine have been democratic for at least the past fourteen years. A prerequisite for the adoption of redistributive policies is that there be elected representatives who are either committed to or who have an incentive to advocate for such policies. The prospects of such an outcome depend not only on candidates personal policy preferences and motivations, but also how they are perceived by voters. One important feature shared by highly unequal democracies is that they tend to be relatively young, with many new parties and candidates in the political scene. This means elections occur under a high degree of uncertainty about critical information voters need to chose their delegates. Thus, in this paper I develop a model of elections as a game of incomplete information to explore how uncertainty, candidates’ motivation (policy vs. office), and beliefs about their ideological inclinations affect what policy interests are likely to be represented in the political process. I explore the model’s assumptions and outcomes empirically using individual level data for each presidential election in Brazil since democratization. ...|$|R
