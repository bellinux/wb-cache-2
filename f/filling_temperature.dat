50|$|When diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} the gas inside them warms {{as a result}} of adiabatic heating. When the gas cools by losing heat to the surroundings, the pressure will drop as described by the general gas equation and Gay-Lussac's law. Divers, to maximise their dive time, generally want their cylinders filled to their safe capacity, the working pressure. To provide the diver with a cylinder filled to the working pressure at the nominal temperature of 15 or 20 °C, the cylinder and gas must be kept cool when filling or filled to a pressure such that when it cools it is at the working pressure. This is known as the developed pressure for the <b>filling</b> <b>temperature.</b> Health and safety regulations and pressure vessel design standards may limit the working temperature of the cylinder, commonly to 65 °C, in which case the cylinder must be filled slowly enough to avoid exceeding the maximum working temperature. Cylinders are often filled at a rate of less than 1 bar (100 kPa or 15 lbf/in²) per second to allow time for heat transfer to the surroundings to limit this increase in temperature. As a method to remove heat faster when filling the cylinder, some filling stations “wet fill” cylinders immersed in a bath of cold water. There is an increased risk of internal cylinder corrosion caused by moisture from the wet environment entering the cylinder due to contamination during connection of the filling hose during wet filling.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of fluid inclusion geothermometry is described from its nineteenth century beginnings {{down to the}} present time. A method for the preparation of samples for fluid inclusion work and the experimental technique using the Leitz 1350 heating stage are described. The problems involved in obtaining representative geothermometric data are outlined. When a sample consists of well-formed crystals it {{is relatively easy to}} determine the thermal history of the sample but not so with massive material. A preliminary investigation was undertaken to assess the variation of data obtained from different sections cut from the one sample and on arbitrary grounds a minimum number of sections and of temperature measurements is suggested so that approximately representative data may be obtained. An investigation of the relationship between filling temperatures of fluid inclusions and the thickness of the enclosing section is described. It was found that on reducing the thickness of a section, the filling temperatures of inclusions decreased. Statistical tests showed the decrease in filling temperatures to be significant and it is suggested that the rate of heating adopted by the writer is too fast to allow equilibrium between the inclusion and the heating stage to be achieved and that the observed filling temperatures are somewhat higher than the actual filling temperatures. A preliminary investigation into the problems of leakage in fluid inclusions is described. Experiments showed that moderate overheating above the <b>filling</b> <b>temperature</b> of an inclusion did not cause leakage but that heating to 100 °C. above the <b>filling</b> <b>temperature</b> usually induced leakage.

The possibility that these brines are formation waters expelled from the Mackenzie basin through the Presqu'ile reef conduit (rather than randomly around the basin periphery) and that the metals in these brines were leached from shales of the Mackenzie basin can not be directly evaluated. However, estimates made for the Western Canada basin immediately to the south on which we have more information about composition and hydrodynamics of formation waters and the easily leachable zinc content of the shales indicate that the volume of shales present could yield 3, 000 times as much Zn as is in the Pine Point ore and that expelled water containing this Zn would be channeled through an exit conduit similar to the Presqu'ile reef...|$|R

When plants were grown at TOS 1, TKW (thousand kernel weight), grain test weight, hardness index, P, Ca, Na and phytate were not significantly changed under e[CO 2].

40|$|The {{problem of}} k-value {{degradation}} (plasma damage) {{is a key}} issue for the integration, and it is becoming more challenging as the dielectric constant of low-k materials scales down. One way to circumvent this issue is temporarily conversion of low-k material from a porous to a dense state by filling the pores with a sacrificial polymer after the deposition and curing of the low-k material. A detailed process scheme for the pore stuffing and postetch polymer removal of PMMA is described in this work. The <b>filling</b> <b>temperature</b> was optimized according to the molecular weight of the PMMA. To remove the polymer after plasma-etching in a purely thermal environment, a temperature of at least 430 [*]°C had to be applied. Annealing assisted by variable frequency microwaves could remove the polymer already at 380 [*]°C and with a He–H 2 afterglow plasma the polymer could be removed at 280 [*]°C.

The free energy is {{expressed}} as a functional F of the spin-singlet pair amplitude psi_ij=psi_m=Delta_m exp(i phi_m); i and j are nearest-neighbor sites of the Cu lattice in which the superconductivity is believed to primarily reside and m labels the site {{at the center of}} the bond between i and j. The system is modeled as a weakly coupled stack of such planes. We hypothesize a simple form, F[Delta,phi]=sum_m (A Delta_m^ 2 + B Delta_m^ 4 / 2) +C sum_ Delta_m Delta_n cos(phi_m-phi_n), for the functional. The coefficients A, B and C are determined from comparison with experiments. We work out a number of consequences of the proposed functional for specific choices of A, B and C as functions of hole density x and temperature T. There can be a rapid crossover of from small to large values as A changes sign on lowering T and the crossover temperatures is identified with the observed pseudogap temperature. The superconducting phase-coherence transition occurs at a different temperature T_c, and describes superconductivity with d-wave symmetry for C> 0. We calculate T_c(x) which has the observed parabolic shape, being strongly influenced by the coupling between Delta_m and phi_m present in F. The superfluid density, the local gap magnitude, the specific heat (with and without a magnetic field) and vortex properties are obtained using F. We compare our results successfully with experiments. We also obtain the electron spectral density as influenced by the coupling between the electrons and the pair correlation function calculated from F.

Based on the gangue mineral assemblage, <b>filling</b> <b>temperature,</b> and preliminary analytical data on fluid inclusions, typical ranges of CO • fugacity (fco•) and temperature for Au-Ag-rich, Pb-Zn-Mn-rich, and Cu-Pb-Zn-rich deposits were determined to be 10 - 3 to 1 atm, 190 ø to 250 øC; 10 - ' to 10 atm, 200 ø to 250 øC; and 10 - • to 103 atm, 200 ø to 350 øC, respectively. This fco•- temperature relationship is {{similar to those of}} active geothermal systems. This similarity and that of thermochemical calculations for the stability of gangue minerals suggest that the fco • for vein-type mineralization in Japan is controlled by alteration minerals commonly occurring in the country rocks (e. g., kaolinitc, plagioclase, epidote, K-mica, K-feldspar, and calcite). From a summary of host rocks for Neogene vein-type mineralization districts in Japan, it was found that many Cu-Pb-Zn-rich vein-type deposits occur in organic-rich sedimentary rocks such as shale and mudstone as well as in altered igneous rocks. In contrast, almost all the Au-Ag-rich vein-type deposits occur in altered volcanic rocks, but only a few in sedimentary rocks.

40|$|The high {{temperature}} conversion (HTC) technique using an elemental analyzer with a glassy carbon tube and <b>filling</b> (<b>temperature</b> conversion/elemental analysis, TC/EA) {{is a widely}} used method for hydrogen isotopic analysis of water and many solid and liquid organic samples with analysis by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). However, the TC/EA IRMS method may produce inaccurate delta H- 2 results, with values deviating by more than 20 mUr (milliurey = 0. 001 = 1 parts per thousand) from the true value for some materials. We show that a single-oven, chromium-filled elemental analyzer coupled to an IRMS substantially improves the measurement quality and reliability for hydrogen isotopic compositions of organic substances (Cr-EA method). Hot chromium maximizes the yield of molecular hydrogen in a helium carrier gas by irreversibly and quantitatively scavenging all reactive elements except hydrogen. In contrast, under TC/EA conditions, heteroelements like nitrogen or chlorine (and other halogens) can form hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) and this can cause isotopic fractionation. The Cr-EA technique thus expands the analytical possibilities for on-line hydrogen-isotope measurements of organic samples significantly. This method yielded reproducibility values (1 -sigma) for delta H- 2 measurements on water and caffeine samples of better than 1. 0 and 0. 5 mUr, respectively. To overcome handling problems with water as the principal calibration anchor for hydrogen isotopic measurements, we have employed an effective and simple strategy using reference waters or other liquids sealed in silver-tube segments. These crimped silver tubes can be employed in both the Cr-EA and TC/EA techniques. They simplify considerably the normalization of hydrogen-isotope measurement data to the VSMOW-SLAP (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water-Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation) scale, and their use improves accuracy of the data by eliminating evaporative loss and associated isotopic fractionation while handling water as a bulk sample.
