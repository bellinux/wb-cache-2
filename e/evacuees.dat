5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 <b>evacuees,</b> including all American civilians and four heads of mission. <b>Evacuees</b> were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the <b>evacuees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evacuation {{efforts were}} hastened on September 2 by the wider {{dispersal}} of <b>evacuees</b> among newly opened shelters. Louis Armstrong International Airport was reopened to allow flights related to relief efforts, {{and began to}} load <b>evacuees</b> onto planes as well.|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining <b>evacuees</b> proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of <b>evacuees.</b> By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of <b>evacuees</b> in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. <b>Evacuees</b> from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E

5|$|On 21 March the Embassy {{predicted}} {{there would}} be 3,600 <b>evacuees,</b> far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated {{the development of a}} new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry <b>evacuees</b> from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from where they would be flown on C-130 planes to Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for <b>evacuees</b> on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of <b>evacuees</b> that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{disembark}} {{in nearby}} Mombasa, as originally thought by the <b>evacuees,</b> the ships were ordered back to Oman—a five-day journey. The sailors and marines made {{way for the}} <b>evacuees</b> to share living quarters. When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the <b>evacuees</b> while aboard the vessel, two hundred signed up within an hour, {{and some of the}} sailors even dressed up as clowns to ease the ordeal for children. At the request of the ambassadors, a formal session with the ships' senior officers was held to express their thanks. On 11 January, the <b>evacuees</b> were offloaded at Muscat, Oman. That afternoon, the American <b>evacuees</b> were flown to Frankfurt, Germany, from where they continued home.|$|E

40|$|Facing the {{potential}} dangers from sudden disasters in urban cities, emergency administrators {{have to make}} an appropriate evacuation plan to mitigate negative consequences. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} <b>evacuee</b> real decision psychology when developing a strategy. The aim of this paper is to analyze <b>evacuee</b> mode choice behavior considering regret aversion psychology during evacuation. First, the utility-based and regret-based models are formulated to obtain evacuees’ preferences on travel mode choice, respectively. According to the data collected from the stated preference (SP) survey on <b>evacuee</b> mode choice, the estimation results show that the regret-based model performs better than the utility model. Moreover, based on the estimates from behavioral analysis, the elasticities of <b>evacuee</b> mode choices are calculated, and transit strategy simulation is undertaken to investigate the influence on <b>evacuee</b> mode switching from private automobile to public transit. The results are expected to help emergency administrators to make a transit-oriented strategy for a sustainable evacuation plan, especially for the benefit of carless people...|$|R

Cyril drives them to Westbourne Hall, home to Phillip Grainger, and his housekeeper, Miss Millington. They refuse to take Norman, but take Mary instead.

5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 <b>evacuees</b> were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting <b>evacuees</b> from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible <b>evacuees</b> now had to make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E
5|$|In September rumours {{were already}} {{circulating}} among the <b>evacuees,</b> and in Gibraltar, {{that the possibility}} of re-evacuating the Gibraltarians once more was being mooted, this time the destination being Jamaica, in the West Indies. After much contention, it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island, and 1,093 <b>evacuees</b> left for Jamaica direct, on 9 October, with more following later on. However petitions followed and the demands were met, partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping. The situation at the end of 1940, therefore, was that approximately 2,000 <b>evacuees</b> were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira, with the bulk of around 10,000 housed in the London area.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Embassy, the <b>evacuees</b> {{had found}} {{whatever}} space was available inside the Embassy compound and <b>evacuees</b> and some staff proceeded to take alcohol from the Embassy's stores.

5|$|In London, home-comers {{were making}} claims on the evacuees’ wartime {{accommodation}} and 500Gibraltarians were re-evacuated to Scotland and 3,000 to camps in Northern Ireland. Although the Governor, Lt. General Sir Noel Mason-MacFarlane, fought valiantly {{on behalf of}} the <b>evacuees</b> and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays. As late as 1947 there were still 2,000 in Northern Irish camps. The last of the <b>evacuees</b> did not see the Rock again until 1951.|$|E
5|$|The HMH-462 CH-53s {{loaded with}} <b>evacuees</b> {{and left the}} compound, they {{unloaded}} the first <b>evacuees</b> delivered by Operation Frequent Wind at 15:40.

Between 19:00 and 21:00 General Carey transferred 3 platoons (130 men) of BLT 2/4 into the Embassy compound to provide additional security and assistance for the Embassy.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrender}} of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible {{objections to the}} return of the <b>evacuees</b> to the Rock. As a result, a Resettlement Board was established in November, and {{at a meeting of the}} Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed. On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1,367repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first repatriation party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520non-priority <b>evacuees</b> remained on the island.|$|E

5|$|At 19:30 General Carey {{directed}} {{that the}} remaining elements guarding the Annex be withdrawn to DAO headquarters (the Alamo) where {{the last of}} the <b>evacuees</b> would await their flight. Once completed, the new defensive perimeter encompassed only LZ 36 and the Alamo. By 20:30 the last <b>evacuees</b> had been loaded onto helicopters. With the evacuation of the landing control teams from the Annex and Alamo completed, General Carey ordered the withdrawal of the ground security forces from the DAO Compound around 22:50. At 23:40 Marines destroyed the satellite terminal, the DAO Compound's last means of direct communication with the outside world. At 00:30 on 30 April, thermite grenades, having been previously placed in selected buildings, ignited as two CH-53s left the DAO parking lot carrying the last elements of BLT 2/4.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the aerial evacuation, tens of {{thousands}} of South Vietnamese fled towards TF-76 aboard junks, sampans, and small craft. MSC tugs pulled barges filled with people from Saigon Port out to TF-76. A flotilla of 26 Republic of Vietnam Navy and other vessels concentrated off Long Sơn Island southwest of Vung Tau with 30,000 sailors, their families, and other civilians on board. On the afternoon of 30 April, TF-76 moved away from the coast, picking up more refugees as they went.

Marine pilots accumulated 1,054 flight hours and flew 682 sorties throughout Operation Frequent Wind. The evacuation of personnel from the DAO compound had lasted nine hours and involved over 50 Marine Corps and Air Force helicopters. In the helicopter evacuation {{a total of}} 395 Americans and 4,475 Vietnamese and third-country nationals were evacuated from the DAO compound and a further 978 U.S. and 1,120 Vietnamese and third-country nationals from the Embassy, giving a total of 1,373 Americans and 5,595 Vietnamese and third country nationals. In addition, Air America helicopters and RVNAF aircraft brought additional <b>evacuees</b> to the TF76 ships. Many of the Vietnamese <b>evacuees</b> were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act.|$|E
5|$|FEMA had {{announced}} that, {{in conjunction with}} Greyhound, the National Guard, and Houston Metro, the 25,000people at the Superdome would be relocated across state lines to the Houston Astrodome.
