They had been occupationally exposed to mercury vapor (10. 6 ± 5. 2 years) and had been away from the source of exposure for 6. 4 ± 4. 04 years. Mean urinary concentration of mercury was 40. 6 ± 36. 4 µg/g creatinine during or up to 1 year after exposure and 2. 71 ± 1. 19 µg/g creatinine {{at the time of}} color vision testing or up to 1 year thereafter. All patients were diagnosed with chronic mercury intoxication, characterized by clinical symptoms and neuropsychological alterations. A control group (N = 36, 48. 6 ± 11. 9 years, 10 females, 1. 5 ± 0. 47 µg mercury/g creatinine) was subjected to the same tests. Inclusion criteria for both groups were Snellen VA 20 / 30 or better and absence of known ophthalmologic pathologies. Color discrimination was assessed with the Farnsworth D- 15 test (D- 15) and with the Lanthony D- 15 d test (D- 15 d). Significant {{differences were found between the}} two eyes of the patients (P < 0. 001) in both tests. Results for the worst eye were also different from controls for both tests: P = 0. 014 for D- 15 and P < 0. 001 for D- 15 d. As shown in previous studies, the D- 15 d proved to be more sensitive than the D- 15 for the screening and diagnosis of the color <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses.</b> Since color <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses</b> were still present many years after the end of exposure, they may be considered to be irreversible, at least under the conditions of the present study...|$|R

Fifteen amblyopes including six anisometropes, seven strabismics, two mixed and 12 age-matched controls were investigated. Contrast discrimination {{was measured using}} established psychophysical procedures that differentiate MC and PC processing. Data were described with {{a model of the}} contrast response of primate retinal ganglion cells. All amblyopes and controls displayed the same contrast signatures on the MC and PC tasks, with three strabismics having reduced sensitivity. Amblyopic PC contrast gain was similar to electrophysiological estimates from visually normal, non-human primates. Sensitivity losses evident in a subset of the amblyopes reflect cortical summation deficits, with no change in retinogeniculate contrast responses. The data do not support the proposal that amblyopic contrast sensitivity losses on MC and PC tasks reflect retinogeniculate deficits, but rather are due to anomalous post-retinogeniculate cortical processing of retinal signals...|$|R

The eye examination, which was normal in every patient, included the Ishihara and City University tests, measurement of Snellen acuity, slit-lamp examination, tonometry, and fundal photography as well as fluorescein angiography. Colour discrimination ability was measured with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test.

40|$|Optical density (OD) of the {{crystalline}} lens {{has been shown}} in non-diabetics to increase linearly with age over the first five decades and at an increased rate thereafter; in insulin dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients, lens OD increases with age and with duration of diabetes at a rate similar to that in non-diabetics over the age of 60 years. Recently, it has been established that colour discrimination is abnormal in a majority of young patients with uncomplicated IDDM and angiographically normal retinas. Colour <b>discrimination</b> <b>loss</b> was attributed to functional abnormalities in the retina or neural pathways; yet the possibility exists that increases in lens OD may account for part or all of the colour <b>discrimination</b> <b>loss</b> in IDDM. In the present study, colour discrimination was compared in aretinopathic IDDM patients and age-matched controls, and then in a group of aretinopathic IDDM patients individually matched to controls with respect to lens OD. Colour discrimination was significantly worse in diabetic patients than in age-matched controls, and was significantly worse when diabetic patients were compared with controls matched for OD. The magnitude of the difference in 100 hue error score between diabetic patients and OD matched controls was, however, considerably less than the difference between diabetic patients and age-matched controls. These data suggest that colour <b>discrimination</b> <b>loss</b> in aretinopathic IDDM patients cannot be explained {{solely on the basis of}} diabetes induced increases in lens OD, but must involve abnormalities of the retina or its neural connections...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Tinted lenses for {{everyday}} use should not impair visual acuity and contrast sensitivity or cause radical changes in color perception. The main {{aim of this}} study was to compare the performance in contrast detection and color discrimination tasks of a set of tinted lenses with that of gray filters of equal luminance under D 65. Methods. The contrast sensitivity functions of 10 observers were measured using sinusoidal gratings of mean luminance of 13 cd/m 2 by the adjustment method. Color discrimination thresholds from white (x = 0. 313, y = 0. 330), green (x = 0. 346, y = 0. 407), and blue (x = 0. 280, y = 0. 253) were measured along 12 directions in the CIE- 1931 xy diagram with and without lenses. Results. Green, brown, and blue filters did not cause significant changes in contrast sensitivity compared with a gray filter of equal luminance, although chromatic discrimination was disturbed. Yellow and orange filters improved achromatic contrast at certain spatial frequencies, but impaired chromatic discrimination. Conclusions. Compared with gray filters of the same luminance, yellow filters may be useful when enhancement of low achromatic contrasts is desirable, although overall brightness decrements may occur. Nevertheless, these lenses cause tritan-like defects with <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses</b> increasing with the cutoff wavelength...|$|R

40|$|Smallholder {{farmers in}} the Philippines are {{typically}} considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, yet, relatively {{little is known about}} how that vulnerability differs between men and women farmers, particularly in conflict-prone areas. Using the region of Mindanao in Philippines as a case study, this paper presents an analysis of focus groups (n = 14) and interviews (n = 77) to showcase gendered vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers to climate change. This analysis reveals that both climate change and conflict significantly increase smallholder vulnerability, resulting in loss of livelihoods, financial assets, agricultural yield and the worsening of debt problems. Women and men are affected differently, resulting in changing farming patterns and coping strategies. Women are more disadvantaged and as such tend to farm in smaller plots, work shorter hours or limit farming to cash crops.

40|$|The {{effect of}} syllabic {{compression}} on speech intelligibility is rarely positive {{and in those}} cases that positive effects have been found, the same positive results could in general be obtained by frequency shaping of the frequency response curve. We programmed a syllabic compressor on a digital processor; the compressor differed from a conventional syllabic compressor by incorporating a delay in the signal path to suppress overshoots and thus minimize transient distortion. Furthermore, the time constants were short: attack time of 5 msec and release time of 15 msec. The compressor was only active in the high-frequency band. An essentially linear signal was added to deliver the low-frequency speech components. The processing resulted in a frequency response that mirrored the hearing loss near threshold and became much flatter for higher level input signals. Speech intelligibility scores for nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant words embedded in carrier phrases were determined for hearing-impaired persons with sloping audiograms and <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses</b> for speech. Results showed little additional effect of frequency shaping to the existing improved speech score for compressed speech. Optimum results were found for a compression ratio 2 with lower speech scores for linear amplification and for compression ratio 8.

The frequency response at the root-mean-square level was adjusted according to the half-gain rule.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} color perception thresholds and relate them to the degree of motor impairment in children with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP). Methods Binocular and monocular chromaticity discrimination thresholds were estimated for the protan, deutan, and tritan color confusion axes in 43 SCP children aged 6 – 15 years who were classified as tetraplegic (n[*]=[*] 12), diplegic (n[*]=[*] 16), and hemiplegic (n[*]=[*] 15) without ophthalmological complaints. Motor impairment was rated according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) in five levels of severity. Results Analysis of variance showed significantly reduced discrimination in tetraplegic children (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) compared with the diplegic, hemiplegic, and control groups. We also found a positive correlation between chromaticity discrimination thresholds and GMFCS ratings in all of the groups. Discussion Chromaticity discrimination thresholds measured psychophysically were reduced for all three color confusion axis in tetraplegic children compared with normal children. Diplegic and hemiplegic children had similar results as normal children. The finding of a correlation between quantified motor impairment and color <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses</b> in SCP patients is a new observation that might help elucidate the causes of color perception loss in these patients. Visual information is essential for the rehabilitation of CP children. Knowledge of the degree of correlation between vision and motor impairment is valuable when planning a rehabilitation program.

40|$|In {{congenital}} color blindness the red-green {{discrimination is}} impaired {{resulting in an}} increased confusion between those colors with yellow. Our post-receptoral physiological mechanisms are organized in two pathways for color perception, a red-green (protanopic and deuteranopic) and a blue-yellow (tritanopic). We argue that the <b>discrimination</b> <b>losses</b> in the yellow area in congenital color vision deficiency subjects could generate a subtle loss of discriminability in the tritanopic channel considering discrepancies with yellow perception. We measured color discrimination thresholds for blue and yellow of tritanopic channel in congenital color deficiency subjects. Chromaticity thresholds were measured around a white background (0. 1977 u’, 0. 4689 v’ in the CIE 1976) consisting of a blue-white and white-yellow thresholds in a tritanopic color confusion line of 21 congenital colorblindness subjects (mean age = 27. 7; SD= 5. 6 years; 14 deuteranomalous and 7 protanomalous) and of 82 (mean age = 25. 1; SD= 3. 7 years) normal color vision subjects. Significant increase in the whole tritanopic axis was found for both deuteranomalous and protanomalous subjects compared to controls for the blue-white (F 2, 100 = 18. 80; p< 0. 0001) and white-yellow (F 2, 100 = 22. 10; p< 0. 0001) thresholds. A Principal Component Analysis found a weighting toward to the yellow thresholds induced by deuteranomalous subjects. In conclusion, the discrimination in the tritanopic color confusion axis is significantly reduced in congenital color vision deficiency compared to normal subjects. Since yellow discrimination was impaired {{the balance of the}} blue-yellow channels is impaired justifying the increased thresholds found for blue-white discrimination. The weighting toward the yellow region of the color space with the deuteranomalous contributing to that perceptual distortion is discussed in terms of physiological mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Stigma is a "natural" social reaction, partly {{unconscious}} and automatic towards "different" and "vulnerable" populations. Suspicion of danger, unemployment, excluded from society, locked in hospital, assaulted or killed are the possible consequences of mental disorders' stigma. Despite advances in psychiatric treatments, {{the stigma of}} the "madness" remains a barrier to access to recovery. The stigmatization process {{is more complex than}} simple labeling, and leads to <b>discrimination</b> and <b>loss</b> of social power. Understanding the mechanisms of stigmatization can determine targets for effective interventions to fight stigma at the individual, institutional and political levels. The roles of patient and family associations, as well as the recovery model for the professionals, are essential. The aim {{of this article is to}} review the various aspects of mental disorders' stigma and to examine ways to cope with them...|$|R
