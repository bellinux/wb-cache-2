50|$|Given {{the poor}} state of {{preservation}} the Semna Despatches were in when they were discovered {{it was inevitable that}} they would need to be preserved. Alan Gardiner funded the preservation with Hugo Ibscher doing the actual preservation work which was begun in 1903 and lasted until around 1939. Ibscher used several different methods for preserving the papyri which included attaching them to Celluloid Nitrate film, <b>gelatin</b> <b>film,</b> and cardboard then sandwiching them between glass. Unfortunately, the use of celluloid nitrate film can be very unstable {{and in the case of}} two of the papyri burning has been caused because of its use. Fortunately, only the two damaged papyri were found to contain celluloid nitrate film with the rest being <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> that is far more stable. The way the preserved papyri were mounted has caused damage however. Because the papyri were mounted in-between two sheets of glass when the frame is moved the papyrus moves slightly causing damage. To stop further damage the British museum started in 2006 to remove the frames and the <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> then remount the papyrus to fine tissue paper to ensure their continued preservation. This recent preservation could only be carried out on some of the papyri however as the adhesive used on the others, Celluloid nitrate adhesive, is very difficult to remove and because of the papyrus’ already fragile state the British museum decided to not try and remount those.|$|E

The results from mechanical properties such as tensile modulus and impact strength of the composites increased with increasing of gelatin content up to 10 wt% and then decreased while the tensile strength and elongation at break decreased.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into {{fish gelatin-based films}} and the resulting effect on the structural, mechanical, and thermal properties of the <b>film</b> was investigated. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>films</b> were prepared using a casting method with D-sorbitol as the plasticizer and carrageenan as the stabilizer. GO nanofillers were dispersed into the gelatin network in different weight percentages. FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the molecular structure of <b>gelatin</b> <b>films</b> and revealed {{that there were no}} major changes in the functional groups of fish <b>gelatin</b> <b>films</b> after addition of GO and carrageenan. Tensile, differential scanning calorimetery (DSC), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were performed to study the effectiveness of GO nanofillers and the effect of sorbitol and carrageenan on the film properties. Addition of 1 wt% of GO significantly increased the tensile strength and the elongation modulus of the <b>gelatin</b> <b>films</b> (to 44 and 1320 MPa, respectively). This was attributed to the strong interfacial interactions between GO sheets and gelatine molecules. However, increasing the GO percentage to 2 wt% resulted in a considerable decrease in both properties (to 11 and 224 MPa, respectively). This might be due to the agglomeration of GO sheets in the gelatin network. DSC results showed a substantial increase in the T-m of the films as a result of adding carrageenan and GO to the gelatin network. This might be due to the strong combination of helical structure of carrageenan and oxygen containing groups of GO...|$|R

The moisture content and water activity of shrimp cracker packaged with all films increased during storage (p <  0.05). The lowest moisture content and water activity {{were found in the}} sample packaged with nylon/LLDPE film throughout the storage (p <  0.05). Sample packaged with fish gelatin films incorporated with palm oil generally had lower moisture content than those without oil added during the first 12  days of storage (p <  0.05). During 15  days of storage, shrimp cracker packaged with nylon/LLDPE film generally had the lower PV and TBARS value as well as volatile compounds, except for n-nonanal, than those stored in fish gelatin films, regardless of oil incorporation. The decrease in crispiness and increase in toughness occurred in all samples during the 15  days of storage. Nevertheless, the lower changes were observed in the sample packaged with nylon/LLDPE film. Overall, <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> showed excellent oxygen barrier property, which was associated with the retardation of lipid oxidation.

30|$|For water {{activity}} (Fig. 1 b), fried shrimp cracker {{covered with}} EF showed lower water activity than those covered with GF during 3 – 9  days of storage (p <  0.05). Initial water activity of fried crackers was 0.22. Much lower water activity {{was also found}} in sample packaged with nylon/LLDPE film throughout the 15  days of storage (p <  0.05). The result indicated that water vapour barrier property of <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> was {{lower than that of}} nylon/LLDPE film. Generally, water vapour barrier property of <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> was poorer than that of other biopolymer films, especially for non-hydrophilic material or synthetic polymer, due to the hydrophilic nature of gelatin and hydrophilic plasticiser required for film preparation (Limpisophon et al. 2009). The increase in moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker was due to the diffusion of water vapour from the surrounding atmosphere through the packaging material. Generally, the incorporation of hydrophobic substances such as oil improved the water vapour barrier property of <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> (Tongnuanchan et al. 2015). Therefore, the incorporation of palm oil could improve the water vapour barrier property of <b>gelatin</b> <b>film,</b> as evidenced by the lower moisture content and water activity of fried shrimp cracker during the storage. Amongst all samples, that stored in air (without film covering) had the higher moisture content and water activity. Therefore, films, either synthetic or gelatin films, were able to serve as the barrier against water vapour migration, in which the quality changes of cracker could be retarded.|$|E

30|$|Solubility of edible film {{in water}} is an {{essential}} asset and water resistance is typically mandatory for possible commercial applications of the edible film. After the 24  h incubation in distilled water, the control <b>gelatin</b> <b>film</b> consequently altered its shape, while the Acacia lignin-gelatin films were found to retain their integrity.

The high water resistance property of lignin-gelatin blended film is possibly due to the interaction and miscibility of phenolic compounds of lignin with amino groups of gelatin. Similar behavior was observed for sago starch films incorporated with lignin isolated from oil palm black liquor waste (Bhat et al. 2013). Literature also suggests that the incorporation of lignin alters the helical structure of gelatin, thereby, subsequently reducing the water solubility of the film (Nunez-Flores et al. 2012; Pena et al. 2010).|$|E

In the present research, the amide-A band shifted to lower frequencies when the ZnO NR concentration increased from 0 % to 5 %. This result clearly showed that the N-H groups from shorter peptide fragments produced hydrogen bonding within the fish <b>gelatin</b> <b>films.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dielectric}} constant, epsilon', and {{the dielectric}} loss, epsilon'', for <b>gelatin</b> <b>films</b> were {{measured in the}} glassy and rubbery states over a frequency range from 20 Hz to 10 MHz; epsilon' and epsilon'' were transformed into M* formalism (M* = 1 /(epsilon' - i epsilon'') = M' + iM''; i, the imaginary unit). The peak of epsilon'' was masked probably due to dc conduction, but the peak of M'', e. g. the conductivity relaxation, for the gelatin used was observed. By fitting the M'' data to the Havriliak-Negami type equation, the relaxation time, tauHN, was evaluated. The value of the activation energy, Etau, evaluated from an Arrhenius plot of 1 /tauHN, agreed well with that of Esigma evaluated from the DC conductivity sigma 0 both in the glassy and rubbery states, indicating that the conductivity relaxation observed for the <b>gelatin</b> <b>films</b> was ascribed to ionic conduction. The value of the activation energy in the glassy state was larger than that in the rubbery state...|$|R
