40|$|A <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> {{termination}} extension in a {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) semiconductor device and method of its fabrication using ion implementation techniques is provided for high power devices. The properties of silicon carbide (SiC) make this wide band gap semiconductor a promising material for high power devices. This potential is demonstrated in various {{devices such as}} p-n diodes, Schottky diodes, bipolar junction transistors, thyristors, etc. These devices require adequate and affordable termination techniques to reduce leakage current and increase breakdown voltage {{in order to maximize}} power handling capabilities. The <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> termination extension disclosed is effective, self-aligned, and simplifies the implementation process...|$|E
40|$|In a <b>graded</b> <b>junction,</b> the {{formalism}} {{for handling}} reflecting boundary conditions must be modified. Since a significant drift term is present, zero recombination velocity {{at the surface}} does not imply a zero excess carrier gradient but rather zero overall flux. A model for analyzing p-n junctions fabricated by implantation or diffusion is presented, assuming the dominant recombination mechanism in the graded region is Auger. The model enables optimization of diode design. By proper selection of parameters, mainly by reducing surface concentration or by increasing the steepness of the dopant profile, {{it is possible to}} drastically reduce the saturation current generated by the graded region...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between gold related levels in silicon is studied with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) using linearly graded junctions. Since the depletion layer extends equally {{on both sides}} in the linearly <b>graded</b> <b>junction,</b> both the acceptor level in the upper half and the donor level in {{the lower half of the}} band gap are simultaneously monitored as majority-carrier traps. It is observed that the concentration of the acceptor level is about four times more than the donor level. The defect concentrations have been calculated using modified DLTS theory for linearly graded junctions where the influence of free-carrier tail has been properly considered for both the traps. The difference in concentrations indicates that the two deep levels originate from different configurations of the gold impurity in silicon...|$|E

40|$|Growing commercialization and {{extensive}} research demonstrate that OLEDs have promising applications in solid state lighting, display, and optical sensor technologies. This work focuses on development of OLED-based optical sensors. OLEDs, sensor films, parallel sensing and enhanced integration with photodetectors were studied. Interface engineering methods e. g., UV-Ozone treatment, <b>graded</b> <b>junction,</b> nanoparticle based coating were investigated to improve microcavity OLEDs, UV OLEDs and Alq 3 OLEDs. Sensors {{are expected to}} have better performance when excited by these OLEDs. ZnO nanoparticles were utilized for improved integration of the sensor films. Stretched exponential was proposed to address the issues of the non-uniform accessibility of O 2 in the dye film, especially at high [O 2]. Multianalyte sensor platform was successfully demonstrated for highly efficient parallel sensing. Polymer photodetectors were explored with OLEDs toward all-organic sensor platforms and enabled the decay time measurement due to fast response...|$|E
40|$|We extend {{concepts}} from microwave {{engineering to}} thermal interfaces {{and explore the}} principles of impedance matching in 1 D. The extension {{is based on the}} generalization of acoustic impedance to non linear dispersions using the contact broadening matrix Γ(ω), extracted from the phonon self energy. For a single junction, we find that for coherent and incoherent phonons the optimal thermal conductance occurs when the matching Γ(ω) equals the Geometric Mean (GM) of the contact broadenings. This criteria favors the transmission of both low and high frequency phonons by requiring that (1) the low frequency acoustic impedance of the junction matches that of the two contacts by minimizing the sum of interfacial resistances; and (2) the cut-off frequency is near the minimum of the two contacts, thereby reducing the spillage of the states into the tunneling regime. For an ultimately scaled single atom/spring junction, the matching criteria transforms to the arithmetic mean for mass and the harmonic mean for spring constant. The matching can be further improved using a composite <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> with an exponential varying broadening that functions like a broadband antireflection coating. There is however a trade off as the increased length of the interface brings in additional intrinsic sources of scattering. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis {{was to examine the}} starting characteristics of Trapatt (Trapped Plasma Avalanche Triggered Transit) oscillators capable of producing high (peak) power at high efficiencies, normally in L and S bands. General approach was aimed to be mainly experimental using deep diffused silicon devices suitable for operation in S band. To perform the experiments an oscillator circuit, in 7 mm coaxial line was constructed, suitable for using a device in S- 4 package. The overall arrangement of the experimental setup was similar to one described by various other researchers for observing the dynamic current and voltage waveforms. The C-V profiling experiment produced a characteristic which suggested that the depletion layer capacitance of the device does not really saturate for increasing voltage even upto its breakdown voltage. A detailed analysis of the C-V plot and related features was carried out and it was concluded that the actual doping distribution appears to be favouring a <b>graded</b> <b>junction.</b> Experimentally it was established that the device has negative resistance at VHF and also at d. c. It has also been shown that the device has small signal negative resistance at the operating frequency of the oscillator. Detailed investigations into the starting characteristics indicated that the oscillations start from the beginning at the final fundamental frequency of the oscillator. For the device and the circuit reported in this thesis no evidence could be found to suggest that Impatt type oscillations trigger the Trapatt oscillations. As a result of our experiments it has been possible to establish that the rate of growth and the time taken for the oscillations to start depend upon the d. c. drive. There are strong indications that in future Trapatt devices could successfully be employed in various systems as a microwave generator...|$|E

A combination of p-n interface roughness and delta function disorder potential allows us to compare experimental results on different devices from the literature.

2500|$|Standard dual {{carriageway}} {{of the traditional}} type was mainly used for schemes on the N11 road, the N18 road and the N25 road. Plans {{for this type of}} {{dual carriageway}} on the N20 road have been superseded by newer plans to build a motorway, the M20, to replace most of this route. Traditionally this type of dual-carriageway had a mixture of at <b>grade</b> <b>junctions</b> (including roundabouts), <b>grade</b> separated <b>junctions,</b> and median crossings. Nowadays they are similar to HQDCs, but minor at grade exits—generally left turn only—are allowed and the design speed (by Irish standards) is only 100km/h. Median crossings and roundabouts are no longer generally found on these schemes. An example of a standard dual carriageway scheme, opened in 2006, [...] is the Ennis bypass although this road has <b>grade</b> separated <b>junctions</b> and no median crossings. This route was upgraded to motorway status in 2009.|$|R
