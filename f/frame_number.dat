5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from <b>frame</b> <b>number</b> one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

The appearance of this model, greatly enhanced by its substantial-looking twin cylinder engine, meant it enjoyed particular popularity in the United Kingdom, where learner motorcyclists are by law restricted to machines of 125 cc and below until they pass their riding test and obtain a full licence. The CM125 Custom was deleted from Honda's United Kingdom line-up in 1986. It continued to be manufactured and sold in Europe and Singapore as the CM125CN (1992, <b>frame</b> <b>numbers</b> (JC05) 5500023-5505185), CM125CP (1993, <b>frame</b> <b>numbers</b> (JC05) 5600001-5608387), CM125CR (1994-1998, <b>frame</b> <b>numbers</b> (JC05) 5700001-5999999) and CM125CX (1999, <b>frame</b> <b>numbers</b> (JH2JC05A*/JH2JC05B*) XK000001-XK099999). Its continuing popularity eventually led to another 125cc custom model being introduced, the Honda CA125 Rebel.|$|R

25|$|A GSM {{transmission}} is organised as sequences of bursts. In a typical channel {{and in one}} direction, one burst is sent every 4.615 milliseconds and contains 114 bits available for information. A5/1 is used to produce for each burst a 114 bit sequence of keystream which is XORed with the 114 bits prior to modulation. A5/1 is initialised using a 64-bit key together with a publicly known 22-bit <b>frame</b> <b>number.</b> Older fielded GSM implementations using Comp128v1 for key generation, had 10 of the key bits fixed at zero, resulting in an effective key length of 54 bits. This weakness was rectified {{with the introduction of}} Comp128v2 which yields proper 64 bits keys. When operating in GPRS / EDGE mode, higher bandwidth radio modulation allows for larger 348 bits frames, and A5/3 is then used in a stream cipher mode to maintain confidentiality.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA digraph D is {{homogeneously}} {{embedded in}} a digraph H if for each vertex x of D and each vertex y of H, there exists an embedding of D in H as an induced subdigraph with x at y. A digraph F of minimum order in which D can be homogeneously embedded is called a frame of D and the order of F is called the <b>framing</b> <b>number</b> of D. Several general results involving <b>frames</b> and <b>framing</b> <b>numbers</b> of digraphs are established. The <b>framing</b> <b>number</b> is determined {{for a number of}} classes of digraphs, including a class of digraphs whose underlying graph is a complete bipartite graph, a class of digraphs whose underlying graph is Cn + K 1, and the lexicographic product of a transitive tournament and a vertex transitive digraph. A relationship between the diameters of the underlying graphs of a digraph and its frame is determined. We show that every tournament has a frame which is also a tournament...|$|R

5000|$|Japanese carmakers {{do not use}} a Vehicle Identification Number as {{is common}} overseas. Instead, Japan uses a <b>Frame</b> <b>Number</b> - nine to twelve {{alphanumeric}} characters identifying model and serial number. For example, <b>Frame</b> <b>Number</b> SV30-0169266 breaks down as [...] "V30" [...] identifying the model as Toyota Camry/Vista x30; [...] "S" [...] identifying the engine (4S-FE), and [...] "0169266" [...] being the serial number of the vehicle. Vehicle make is not identified but slight number variations can identify the carmaker, i.e. Toyota usually uses seven digits for its serial numbers while Nissan uses six. Because a <b>frame</b> <b>number</b> contains far less information than a VIN, JDM vehicles also use a Model Code. As an example, SV30-BTPNK breaks down as [...] "SV30", which means the same as above, and [...] "BTPNK" [...] which designates a set of features incorporated in the vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|To correct this, {{drop frame}} SMPTE {{timecode}} was invented. In {{spite of what}} the name implies, no video frames are dropped (skipped) using drop-frame timecode.

Our work follow this trend with the main object to propose a <b>frame</b> sequence <b>number</b> analysis based security algorithm against DoS attacks in 802. 11 standard networks. In the analytical part of this work we have described most common DoS mechanisms and countermeasures in 802. 11 wireless networks and detailed on present security solutions based on <b>frame</b> sequence <b>number</b> analysis. We concluded that physical layer attacks based on wlan signal manipulations are most severe, but link layer attacks are also popular due less power consumption and simpler link layer frame forgery based attack mechanisms, such as fake deauthentication or massive probe request flood. Majority link layer DoS attacks methods could potentially be blocked by analysing <b>frames</b> sequence <b>number</b> and actively destroying frames with anomaliuos sequence characteristics. In the research part of this work we have proposed a <b>frame</b> sequence <b>number</b> analysis based security algorithm against link layer DoS attacks and developed a model for simulating and evaluating DoS attacks and security algorithms.
