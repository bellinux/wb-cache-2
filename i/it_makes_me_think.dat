500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song to get excited about the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening." [...] The album concludes with [...] "Everytime I Eat Vegetables <b>It</b> <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Think</b> of You", which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a [...] "sing along." ...|$|E

With nothing to stimulate her, she becomes obsessed by the pattern and color of the wallpaper. [...] "It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of all the yellow things I ever saw – not {{beautiful}} ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things. But {{there is something else}} about that paper – the smell! ... The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Its musicians {{tended to}} reject the name [...] "krautrock". This was also the case for [...] "kosmische Musik" [...] ("cosmic music"), a {{marketing}} name invented by record producer Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser for krautrock bands like Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Klaus Schulze. Musicologist Julian Cope, in his book Krautrocksampler, says [...] "Krautrock is a subjective British phenomenon," [...] based {{on the way the}} music was received in the UK rather than on the actual West German music scene out of which it grew. For instance, while one of the main groups originally tagged as krautrock, Faust, recorded a seminal 12-minute track they titled [...] "Krautrock", they would later distance themselves from the term, saying: [...] "When the English people started talking about Krautrock, we thought they were just taking the piss... and when you hear the so-called 'Krautrock renaissance,' <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> everything we did was for nothing." [...] West German's music press initially used [...] "krautrock" [...] as a pejorative, but the term lost its stigma after the music gained success in Britain.|$|E

There {{are some things}} about <b>it</b> which <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> so; but if he is really a {{criminal}} {{he must have had}} trials and temptations which led him into his present mode of life.

6000|$|... "Oh, it's no trouble"--"But I'm glad--I'm glad we've {{had this}} understanding. I'm very glad. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> worse {{of myself and}} better of--others." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly. My {{business}} is to guess what you would like and carry it {{out as far as}} I can. When I'm right this saves you some trouble and gives me keen satisfaction. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> I am intelligent." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of {{the cradle}} as the cocoon or {{chrysalis}} in which, as by a miracle (for here natural and supernatural seem {{one and the}} same), the caterpillar has undergone his transformation and emerging spreads his wings and forthwith takes his flight a full-grown butterfly with all its senses and faculties complete.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'll give YOU one, and {{you shall}} {{do as you}} like about giving it to her.

"Because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> {{of another}} title {{that ought to}} have been mine--ours (I speak for dear Sir George's and my darling boy's sake, Heaven knows, not mine).

60|$|My name's Tom. I'm {{twenty-eight years}} old. Everybody knows {{me in the}} institution. This is an institution, you know. It belongs to the State of California and is run by politics. I know. I've been here a long time. Everybody trusts me. I run errands all over the place, when I'm not busy with the droolers.

6000|$|... "No, I'm {{afraid it}} would {{scarcely}} be proper, under the circumstances. Then I must be 'Mrs. Ericson.'

'Mrs. Eric----'" [...] Her voice ran down; she flushed and said, defensively: [...] "What time is it? I think {{we must be}} starting. I telephoned I would be home by ten." [...] Her tone was conventional as her words.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was right. It's a {{windfall}} for us newsdealers, {{as well as}} a glorious victory to match. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of my old war days, when I was aboard of the Carondelet under Captain Walke. We didn't sink so many ships as Dewey has at Manila, but we sank some, and smashed many a shore battery in the bargain, {{along the banks of the}} Mississippi. What does that extra have to say?" [...] and Phil Newell, the one-legged civil-war naval veteran, who was also proprietor of the news-stand, took the sheet which Walter Russell, his clerk, handed out.|$|E
6000|$|... 30. I was {{not able}} to go to church or Court to-day for my shoulder. The pain has left my shoulder, and crept to my neck and collar-bone. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of poo Ppt's bladebone. Urge, urge, urge; dogs gnawing. I went in a chair at two, and dined with Mrs. Van, where I could be easy, and came back at seven. My Hungary water is gone; and to-night I use spirits of wine, which my landlady tells me is very good. It has rained terribly all day long, and is {{extremely}} cold. I am very uneasy, and such cruel twinges every moment! Nite deelest MD.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{like the}} name, don't like it. There's no smeddum to it. Besides, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of my Aunt Jinny. She called her three girls Faith, Hope, and Charity. Faith didn't believe in anything--Hope was a born pessimist--and Charity was a miser. You {{ought to be}} called Red Rose--you look like one when you're mad. I'LL call you Red Rose. And you've roped me into {{promising}} to go to church? But only once a month, remember--only once a month. Come now, girl, will you let me off? I used to pay a hundred to the salary every year and go to church. If I promise to pay two hundred a year will you let me off going to church? Come now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is really}} too bad," [...] murmured Mrs. Bellmore, with an {{approving}} glance of her fine eyes about the vast chamber done in lilac and old gold. [...] "And {{it was in}} this room she saw it! Oh, no, I'm not afraid of ghosts. Don't have the least fear on my account. I'm glad you put me in here. I think family ghosts so interesting! But, really, the story does sound a little inconsistent. I should have expected something better from Mrs. Fischer-Suympkins. Don't they carry bricks in hods? Why should a ghost bring bricks into a villa built of marble and stone? I'm so sorry, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> that age is beginning to tell upon Mrs. Fischer-Suympkins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Diary entry) June 1. Last {{night and}} to-day sea very high and [...] cobbling, {{breaking}} over and making us all wet and cold. Weather [...] squally, {{and there is}} no doubt that only careful management--with [...] God's protecting care--preserved us through both the night and the [...] day; and really it is most marvellous how every morsel that passes [...] our lips is blessed to us. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> daily of the miracle [...] of the loaves and fishes. Henry keeps up wonderfully, which is a [...] great consolation to me. I somehow have great confidence, and hope [...] that our afflictions will soon be ended, though we are running [...] rapidly across the track of both outward and inward bound vessels, [...] and away from them; our chief hope is a whaler, man-of-war, or some [...] Australian ship.
