5|$|By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was {{virtually}} destroyed, {{with the remainder}} waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army. But much to the frustration of Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did not arrive before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate {{the dead and the}} wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E

5|$|In February, {{the corps}} {{consisted}} of the 1st, 2nd, 26th, 32nd, 41st, and 42nd Infantry Divisions. From February to July, 1918, the German Army launched four major offensives, attempting to secure victory before the full American <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> be mobilized. The final offensive, started in July 1918, {{was an attempt to}} cross the Marne, in the area of Château-Thierry, but I Corps and other formations on the American lines held, and the attack was rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, General Ngô Quang Trưởng ordered General Trần Văn Nhựt to {{mobilise}} the 2nd Division (South Vietnam), the 12th Ranger Group, {{elements of}} the 11th Armoured Squadron and one regional force battalion to mount a counter-attack from Tuan Duong to Cam Khe and Duong Con. General Trưởng also ordered the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment (3rd Infantry Division) to depart from Da Nang, and protect Tam Kỳ, so that General Nhut's <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> be free up to fight the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three {{options for the}} future of the mounted police: the <b>force</b> <b>could</b> be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the <b>force</b> <b>could</b> be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the <b>force</b> <b>could</b> be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|R

5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the campaign was {{the defeat of the}} approximately 40,000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, also known as Viet Cong) in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodian neutrality and military weakness made its territory a safe zone where Vietnamese communist <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, it sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government by eliminating the cross-border threat.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E

He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E

5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and {{confidence of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), which was already high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E
5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|From the north, Warsaw, which {{spans the}} Vistula, was {{effectively}} shielded by the Vistula, Bug and Narew rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering {{equipment for the}} river crossings inhibited a flanking attack of Warsaw from the west, which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards Płock, Włocławek and Toruń, where their <b>forces</b> <b>could</b> cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the Warsaw Fortress, ran mostly along {{the western side of}} the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of their withdrawal from Warsaw in 1915, during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal <b>forces,</b> <b>could</b> be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
