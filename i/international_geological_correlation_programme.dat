The four-year-Iong IGCP project was begun in 1992 to investigate the petrology and metallogeny of various intracontinental mafic igneous provinces with an overall goal of establishing geological criteria for targeting mineral deposits in such environments. The principal goal of the 1995 meeting is to showcase to the international scientific and exploration communities the significant advances in our understanding of the structure, mineralization, and magmatic history of the Midcontinent rift. Toward this end, three field trips have been organized around the three-day symposium to be held August 25 - 27, 1995 in Duluth. The field trips are designed to provide a broad overview of the geologic framework of the Midcontinent rift, where it is best exposed in the western Lake Superior region. Field trip I (August 19 - 24) looks at the physical volcanology of the flood basalts exposed on Isle Royale. Field trip II (August 22 - 24) highlights the stratigraphy, structure and mineralization of the volcanic and sedimentary rocks forming the southern limb of the Midcontinent rift in Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. The post-symposium field trip ill (August 28 -September 1) focusses on the geology and ore deposits associated with the intrusive rocks of the Midcontinent rift exposed along the north shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota and Ontario...|$|R

40|$|Intensive {{research}} on the recent foraminifera in the Gulf of Aqaba- Elat and their physico-chemical environment is being carried out {{for the last decade}} by groups of specialists from the Universities of Jerusalem, Basel, and Copenhagen. The results obtained hitherto indicate that this part of the northern Red Sea may represent a model-area of prime interest for a better understanding of foraminiferal distribution and, therefore, for paleontological interpretations of fossil faunas. The involvement in the study of this model area of the Utrecht University group is based on the latter's participation in the <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> Program, Project 73 / 1 / 1 "Accuracy in Time". Since many biostratigraphical correlations are based on the evolution of measurable parameters of larger foraminiferal species groups, an investigation of possibly environment-dependent morphological changes in living Foraminifera was urgently needed. A recently advanced theory that proloculus-size might increase at greater water-depth was one such topic. Since the thermo-, halo-, and pycnoclines in the Gulf of Elat are rather insignificant, changes with depth in morphology and distribution of foraminiferal species must be governed by depth-related factors other than temperature, salinity or density. Direct or indirect influence of light penetration and types of substrate are thought to control in the Gulf the depthdistribution of the Soritidae and of the investigated species of Borelis, Amphistegina, Planorbulinella, Operculina, Heterostegina, and Heterocylina. Light may equally influence the intraspecific variation in several of these groups. Major changes seem to take place in the uppermost 80 meters of the depth-profiles. For the LG. C. P. project satisfactory estimates can be made now of the range of variation that mean values of such "evolutionary" features as protoconch diameter and nepionic arrangement may show at one time level, as a consequence of environmental control. The volume summarizes the present-day knowledge on the distribution and morphology of the larger Foraminifera of the Gulf, on their reproduction cycles, symbionts, and their possibly symbiont- and depth-related variability in stable oxygen-isotope ratios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{an introduction}} to and summary for the Atlas of Contourite Systems that has been compiled {{as part of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> Project - IGCP 432. Following the seminal works of George Wust on the physical oceanography of bottom currents, and Charley Hollister on contourite sediments, a series of significant advances have been made over the past few decades. While accepting that ideas and terms must remain flexible as our knowledge base continues to increase, we present a consensus view on terminology and definitions of bottom currents, contourites and drifts. Both thermohaline and wind-driven circulation, influenced by Coriolis Force and molded by topography, contribute to the oceanic system of bottom currents. These semi-permanent currents show significant variability in time and space, marked by periodic benthic storm events in areas of high surface kinetic energy. Six different drift types are recognized in the ocean basins and margins at depths greater than about 300 m: (i) contourite sheet drifts; (ii) elongate mounded drifts; (iii) channel related drifts; (iv) confined drifts; (v) infill drifts; and (vi) modified drift-turbidite systems. In addition to this overall geometry, their chief seismic characteristics include: a uniform reflector pattern that reflects long-term stability, drift-wide erosional discontinuities caused by periodic changes in bottom current regime, and stacked broadly lenticular seismic depositional units showing oblique to downcurrent migration. At a smaller scale, a variety of seismic facies can be recognized that are here related to bottom current intensity. A model for seismic facies cyclicity (alternating transparent/reflector zones) is further elaborated, and linked to bottom current/climate change. Both erosional features and depositional bedforms are diagnostic of bottom current systems and velocities. Many different contourite facies are now known to exist, encompassing all compositional types. We propose here a Cl- 5 notation for the standard contourite facies sequence, which can be interpreted in terms of fluctuation in bottom current velocity and/or sediment supply. Several proxies can be utilized to decode contourite successions in terms of current fluctuation. Gravel lag and shale chip contourites, as well as erosional discontinuities are indicative of still greater velocities. There are a small but growing number of land-based examples of fossil contourites, based on careful analysis using the recommended three-stage approach to interpretation. Debate still surrounds the recognition and interpretation of bottom current reworked turbidites...|$|R

R. -Canada Joint Seminar, August 21 - 23, 1990, Duluth, MinnesotaThe {{geologic}} {{histories of}} the Canadian and Baltic Shields in North America and Europe, respectively, are broadly similar, and the topic was discussed during a conference and field trip involving North American and Russian participants {{in the late summer}} of 1990. During a two-day meeting prior to the field trip, twelve North American and eleven Soviet geologists presented papers, and participants discussed a variety of problems and ideas in Precambrian stratigraphy, sedimentology, tectonics, magmatism, industrial minerals, and metallogeny. Special emphasis was placed on problems of correlation. All papers were simultaneously interpreted by Senior Translator and Interpreter Grigori Sokolov of the Institute of Geology, Karelian Branch, U. S. S. R. Academy of Sciences, who accompanied the Russian delegation. His ability contributed greatly to the meeting's success. In addition to the speakers, thirty-eight geologists attended the conference: four Canadians, two Finns, and thirty-two Americans, including eight graduate students. As a result of the seminar and field trip, exciting and promising opportunities for continued cooperation were identified. Specific proposed activities include meetings, field excursions, short courses, joint publications, individual research-oriented exchanges, and joint projects. Involvement of young geologists was especially encouraged to promote long-term cooperative relationships. Opportunities also were identified for cooperation with other international projects, such as existing bilateral programs and the <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> Program. It was mutually agreed that in 1991 - 1992, the Institute of Geology, Karelian Research Center, and the Kola Research Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences will host conferences and field trips on Proterozoic and Archean geology and metallogeny in the eastern Baltic shield. In 1991, the field program will emphasize Proterozoic geology, and in 1992, Archean geology. Other joint activities in the future will depend on the outcome of the 1991 and 1992 meetings. It was the intent of the organizers to bring this joint activity to the attention of officials involved in relevant international programs. Toward that end this proceedings volume has been published by the Minnesota Geological Survey. The body of this report consists of two parts; the first is a series of short papers that provide an overview of the Precambrian geology in the Great Lakes Region; the second part consists of a similar overview of {{the eastern part of the}} Baltic Shield.

40|$|McKerrow (1990), the {{so-called}} ‘Green Book’, marked a turn-ing point in Palaeozoic biogeography and geography. The 40 papers in that volume included substantial new data and important syntheses on palaeoclimatology, palaeomagnetism and the distri-bution of climatically sensitive sediments, {{but the majority}} of con-tributions were on Palaeozoic biogeography. Since 1990 there have been major advances in the taxonomy of Early Palaeozoic organisms, the correlation of Lower Palaeozoic rocks together with numerical methods for the analysis of fossils and their distri-butions. Moreover and most significantly there has been a quantum leap in the accuracy and precision of palaeogeographic reconstruc-tions, reconciling in many cases palaeomagnetic data and the dis-tribution of fossil organisms. The Early or (Lower) Palaeozoic was an interval character-ized by a major radiation of marine life, including not only the ‘Cambrian Explosion’, but also the ‘Great Ordovician Biodiver-sification’. An International Geoscience Programme (formerly <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> <b>Programme,</b> IGCP) was dedi-cated to the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (IGCP 410, 1997 – 2002).

Zhao gained his PhD in Mineral Resource Prospecting and Exploration from RIPED in 2003.Zhao has been engaged in the research on oil and gas accumulation & distribution theory as well as exploration practice in onshore China for nearly 30 years. He has accumulated rich experience and knowledge in hydrocarbon generation, accumulation and distribution in the superimposed petroliferous basins, petroleum resources evaluation and play assessments, petroleum system analysis and strategic study on the future oil & gas supply and demand in China.His first major contribution, made in the late 1980s, was about the distribution patterns of Jurassic coal measure-derived hydrocarbon reservoirs in Turpan-Hami basin in NW China, which help to propose the favorable exploration regions and targets that led to the breakthrough of commercial oil flow from the Jurassic interval after nearly 30 years of exploration stop. Afterwards, he put forth the new geological theories like natural gas relaying generation, sag-wide oil-bearing distribution and lithology-related reservoirs with large-scale, etc. These concepts have been widely applied to the exploration practice in the past 10 years, which made great contributions in discovering several large oil/gas fields particularly in the hydrocarbon-rich source kitchen areas of Ordos, Songliao, Tarim and Sichuan basins in onshore China.Zhao has published over 100 technical papers {{both at home and abroad}} so far. He is also the first author of 6 academic books.

40|$|This Memoir {{explores the}} {{variability}} and controlling processes of sedimentation, morphology and tectonics {{on the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s continental shelves, with emphasis on their evolution during the last glacio-eustatic cycle. This work builds on some earlier volumes on continental shelves, notably those by Trumbul et al. (1958), Boillot (1978), De Batist 2 ̆ 6 Jacobs (1996), Nittrouer et al. (2007) and Li et al. (2012) among others, although {{there has not been}} a previous comprehensive global-scale synthesis. The subject material presented here was developed in several International Geoscience Programmes (formerly the <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> <b>Programme,</b> IGCP) concerned with shelves. Project 396 2 ̆ 7 Continental Shelves in the Quaternary 2 ̆ 7 (1996 - 2000) was followed by IGCP 464 2 ̆ 7 Continental Shelves during the Last Glacial Cycle: Knowledge and Applications 2 ̆ 7 (2001 - 2007) and finally by IGCP 526 2 ̆ 7 Risks, Resources and Record of the Past on the Continental Shelf 2 ̆ 7 (2007 - 2011). In this Memoir, 23 papers are devoted to the description of different aspects of shelves from all seven continents and which are representative of the world 2 ̆ 7 s shelves. However, there remain significant gaps in our compilation. A glance at Figure 1. 1 indicates the sparse coverage of data, particularly using modern techniques of investigation, for Africa, Russia and the Polar regions. However, new data are presented from some frontier provinces, such as Myanmar, Morocco and Ecuador...|$|E
40|$|The Forum of European Geological Surveys (FOREGS) {{includes}} Geological Surveys from 34 European {{countries and}} {{is responsible for}} co-ordinating Geological Survey activities in Europe. The FOREGS Geochemistry Task Group was established in 1994 to supervise European geochemical mapping policy for environmental, legislative, resource-management and scientific purposes. The task group comprises representatives from five countries, charged initially with the compilation of an inventory of geochemical data within FOREGS countries. The preparation of European Geochemical Baseline maps will involve the integration of different national datasets following {{the recommendations of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> <b>Programme</b> (IGCP) Project 259 “International Geochemical Mapping”. Results of the inventory show that most geochemical surveys in Europe conform to the IGCP 259 recommendations. Stream sediment (26 % coverage), surface water (19 % coverage), soil/till (21 % coverage) and radiometric data (19 % coverage) are the most extensive sample types, and the majority of surveys (81 %) have been carried out at sampling densities of ≤ 1 sample per 100 km 2. Most filtered-water surveys are based on a filter size of 0. 45 µm, and 83 % of stream sediment surveys collect samples sieved at 100 - 200 µm. The collection of the Global Reference Network (GRN) samples recommended by IGCP 259 to provide internationally standardised geochemical data and the careful use of statistical and map-generation techniques should facilitate the levelling of different national datasets and preparation of a European Geochemical Baseline...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a broader}} {{awareness}} {{than ever that}} we live in a changing environment. The spectre of climate change is of wide concern, and the observed trends and anticipated consequences of an acceleration of sea-level rise pose a series of threats for the future of people who live in coastal communities. Coastal geoscientists are able to reconstruct the position of former sea levels; they can also explain much of the geographical variation in relative sea-level history. Successive collaborative projects (many under the auspices of international programmes sponsored by IGCP and INQUA) derived local sea-level histories and compiled atlases of relative sea-level curves, and some addressed past coastal behaviour in response to these changes. The most recent <b>International</b> <b>Geological</b> <b>Correlation</b> <b>programme</b> project 588, 2 ̆ 7 Preparing for coastal change 2 ̆ 7, continues this impressive lineage of projects that have laid the foundations for our understanding of sea-level behaviour over the late Quaternary. Today, these issues are a major focus in the debate about climate change, its impacts, and the need for adaptation on the most vulnerable shorelines. There is clearly a role for the palaeoenvironmental skillset honed through successive geoscientific projects. Investigations of past coastal environments have provided the tools for delineating past levels of the sea, but the stratigraphical and geochronological studies which were necessary to reconstruct the sea-level position also provide insights into where the shoreline lay and how the coast behaved as sea level changed. If the present is the key to the past, then the past, seen from the context of the present, can be a guide to the future. Collaborative projects and international co-operation between scientists from different disciplines can play important roles in future debates about how our world will change. First, the lessons learnt about the patterns of variation of relative sea level need to be more widely recognised by climate scientists. Efforts aimed at establishing the rate of future global sea-level rise need to be complemented by protocols to determine regional deviations from that mean rate of sea-level change. Second, modes of coastal change need to be identified to replace simplistic heuristics of coastal response, such as the Bruun rule. Simulation modelling offers a suite of tools that appear to give coastal managers guidance, but geoscientists should strive to produce evidence that can be used to develop and validate model behaviour. Coastal scientists presently have a relatively good understanding of coastal behaviour at millennial timescales, and process operation at contemporary timescales. However, there is less certainty about how coasts change on decadal to century timescales. It is these latter timescales which are particularly important for managers and policy-makers. These, and related challenges, provide a focus for research that will have a relevance for society that the coastal geoscience research community has rarely experienced...|$|E
