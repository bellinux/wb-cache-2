5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found that water fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E

40|$|How <b>are</b> {{reasons and}} <b>evidence</b> interrelated? According to one {{prevalent}} view, reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> equivalent: <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> a reason, and a reason <b>is</b> <b>evidence.</b> On another view reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conditionally related: if there <b>is</b> <b>evidence,</b> then there <b>is</b> a reason. On {{a different view}} reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> disjunctively related: reasons or <b>evidence</b> can <b>be</b> substituted for each other. In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> conjunctively related: <b>evidence</b> and reasons <b>are</b> distinguishable yet inseparable. I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> distinct because they come apart in certain cases, and I argue reasons and <b>evidence</b> <b>are</b> inseparable because only when properly conjoined are they capable of yielding correct verdicts on important cases in epistemology...|$|R

40|$|A {{normative}} Bayesian {{theory of}} deliberation and judgement requires a procedure for merging {{the evidence of}} a collection of agents. In order to provide such a procedure, one needs to ask what the <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> that grounds Bayesian probabilities. After finding fault with several views on the nature of evidence (the views that <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> knowledge; that <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> whatever is fully believed; that <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> observationally set credence; that <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> information), it <b>is</b> argued that <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> whatever is rationally taken for granted.

50|$|Anecdotal <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> an {{informal}} account {{of evidence in}} the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to scientific evidence, as <b>evidence</b> that cannot <b>be</b> investigated using the scientific method.

Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E

Veltmann responded that this line of <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. Justice Department, {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands.

40|$|Abstract This {{article is}} part of a series written for people {{responsible}} for making decisions about health policies and programmes and for those who support these decision makers. Evidence about local conditions <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> that <b>is</b> available from the specific setting(s) in which a decision or action on a policy or programme option will <b>be</b> taken. Such <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> always needed, together with other forms of evidence, in order to inform decisions about options. Global <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> the best starting point for judgements about effects, factors that modify those effects, and insights into ways to approach and address problems. But local <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> needed for most other judgements about what decisions and actions should be taken. In this article, we suggest five questions that can help to identify and appraise the local <b>evidence</b> that <b>is</b> needed to inform a decision about policy or programme options. These are: 1. What local <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> needed to inform a decision about options? 2. How can the necessary local <b>evidence</b> <b>be</b> found? 3. How should the quality of the available local <b>evidence</b> <b>be</b> assessed? 4. Are there important variations in the availability, quality or results of local evidence? 5. How should local <b>evidence</b> <b>be</b> incorporated with other information?</p...|$|R
5000|$|Admissible evidence, in a {{court of}} law, is any testimonial, documentary, or {{tangible}} <b>evidence</b> that may <b>be</b> introduced to a factfinder—usually a judge or jury—to establish or to bolster a point put forth by a party to the proceeding. For <b>evidence</b> to <b>be</b> admissible, it must be relevant, without being unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability.

5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} would lead to the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} February, Bothwell was {{generally}} believed to be guilty of Darnley's assassination. Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E
50|$|Tampering with <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related}} to the legal issue of {{spoliation}} of <b>evidence,</b> which <b>is</b> usually the civil law or due process version of the same concept (but may itself be a crime). Tampering with <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> also {{closely related to}} obstruction of justice and perverting the course of justice, and these two kinds of crimes are often charged together. The goal of tampering with <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> usually to cover up a crime.|$|R
50|$|The {{scheme of}} Chapter 3 of the Act deals with {{admissibility}} of <b>evidence.</b> <b>Evidence</b> which <b>is</b> relevant is generally admissible, and <b>evidence</b> which <b>is</b> irrelevant <b>is</b> inadmissible. <b>Evidence</b> <b>is</b> relevant if it <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) {{the assessment of}} the probability of a fact in issue in the proceedings. As <b>evidence</b> which <b>is</b> relevant has the capability to affect {{the assessment of the}} probability of the existence of a fact in issue, it is “probative”. This determination is known as logical relevance. Logical relevance merely requires evidence have a logical connection to the facts in issue.But neither s 55 nor s 56 of the Act requires that <b>evidence</b> <b>be</b> probative to a particular degree for it to <b>be</b> admissible. <b>Evidence</b> that <b>is</b> of only some, even slight, probative value will be admissible, just as it is at common law. Therefore, <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> either relevant or it is not and if the <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> not relevant then no further question arises about its admissibility. However, logical relevance isn't sufficient to establish the potential admissibility of the <b>evidence</b> and <b>is</b> still possible for the <b>evidence</b> to <b>be</b> inadmissible. This determination is known as ‘legal relevance’ as opposed to logical relevance and sets a demanding test for discretionary exclusion (but one that is not obligatory) where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the <b>evidence</b> might <b>be</b> unfairly prejudicial. Once the legal relevance of the <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> established, the exclusionary principles and exceptions to those principles are also to be considered.|$|R
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced.
