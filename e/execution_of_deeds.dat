40|$|Discusses {{reforms to}} {{partnership}} law {{that have been}} proposed by the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission in their 'Partnership Law: a Joint Consultation Paper', and considers whether the reforms are necessary or not and what effect {{they are likely to}} have on the qualities of flexibility, informality and privacy that presently characterize general partnerships. Examines, therefore, proposed reforms in the following areas: the setting up of a partnership (particularly the proposal for a system of registration), the introduction of separate legal personality (and its effect on, inter alia, continuity, land and other property ownership contracts and the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>deeds),</b> and reforms affecting the relationships of partners (for example, the proposal to increase statutory duties owed to the partnership and partners). Provides the author's own recommendations for reform and concludes that, although most of the proposed reforms (notably the introduction of separate legal personality) are justifiable and should not have an adverse impact on flexibility, informality and privacy, other proposals, in particular registration and increased statutory duties, would have adverse effects on these qualities and should not be adopted...|$|E

The writ petition was allowed by the High Court primarily on the ground that the lease deed referred only to the transfer of the land and there was no reference whatsoever that the building constructed thereon at a later stage would also be treated to have been demised by the lessor; that the allottee members, as owners of the flats/apartments, built from the contributions made by them could not be compelled to purchase it from the society and that such a transfer will be fictitious and involuntary, and thus a void transaction under the Indian Contract Act.

60|$|The {{prisoner}} trembled, however, {{and changed}} colour, when a step was {{heard on the}} stair, and {{the door of the}} turret-chamber slowly opened, and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap, pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest.

Langlois considered that he had purchased 30000 acre but the total area is nearer 300000 acre.

At {{the end of the}} 1838 whaling season Langlois left New Zealand waters, and on arriving in France some time after June 1839, set to work to market the property which he had bought from the Māori. He succeeded in interesting the marquis de las Marismas Aguado, a financier who had considerable influence with the Government. The Marquis set out to enlist support in Bordeaux for the formation of a company to exploit the property represented by Langlois's deed: the purpose of that settlement would be to establish on Banks Peninsula a settlement to serve as a base for French whaleships and other vessels in the Pacific Ocean. The difficulties of this first stage of the negotiations, in which rather too much dependency was placed on government action and aid, caused the Marquis to withdraw from the project.|$|R

40|$|A mother, her daughter, and her {{son-in-law}} received {{title to}} a North Carolina home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Little did the mother {{know that she}} was almost instantly destroying the newborn joint tenancy when, in order to finance the purchase price, she alone executed a mortgage note and <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> trust at the closing. When she died several years later with that mortgage loan in default, a legal dispute arose centered on whether 2 ̆ 2 severance 2 ̆ 2 of the joint tenancy had occurred. Following traditional joint tenancy law theory, the Court of Appeals decided somewhat reluctantly that the joint tenancy was indeed severed at the very closing during which it was successfully created; for by executing the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> trust, the mother had conveyed 2 ̆ 2 title 2 ̆ 2 according to North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s title theory of mortgage law. Under a common law 2 ̆ 2 four unities 2 ̆ 2 analysis, her <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> trust unilaterally destroyed the unity of title required for a joint tenancy and automatically converted it into a tenancy in common. Contrary to what was most likely intended as part of an informal family estate and eldercare plan, her fifty percent undivided interest in the home remained in her estate at her death and did not pass by survivorship to her daughter and son-in-law. 2 ̆ 7 This article addresses key real property and public policy issues triggered by the 1990 legislative reincarnation of the joint tenancy with right of survivorship in North Carolina with a special emphasis on creation and severance issues. It also focuses on piecemeal statutory amendments and revisions to North Carolina joint tenancy law since 1990. The authors 2 ̆ 7 analysis leads to the following conclusions: First, because joint tenancy creation is now intent-based, not unities-based, joint tenancy termination should likewise be intent-based, not unities-destruction-based. Second, unilateral 2 ̆ 2 stealth 2 ̆ 2 severances of joint tenancies are contrary to public policy, unless accompanied by effective prior notice to the other joint tenant or tenants. Third, North Carolina General Statute section 41 - 2 requires substantial and comprehensive revision to further clarify the contemporary law of joint tenancy in North Carolina. Fourth, substantial improvement in the law 2 ̆ 7 s transparency is required in the legislative process if all interested parties, including consumers, are to have a meaningful opportunity to provide input when important real property laws are added, revised, or deleted from the General Statutes...|$|R
50|$|At its foundation, {{the school}} {{inherited}} {{part of a}} charitable endowment called Poynetts, originally established at South Benfleet in the will of Robert Blossom (d. 1418). This property had become the endowment of an earlier Enfield chantry-school which precedes and is incorporated into the Grammar School. As Dr. Birkett Marshall points out, there is evidence a schoolmaster existed in Enfield prior to 1524, based on {{an account of the}} funeral of a Sir Thomas Lovell. An older school-house which certainly still existed east of the churchyard in 1572 seems likely to have housed the grammar school established in 1558 until the erection in the 1580s of the Tudor building sometimes referred to as the Old Hall. This was built in the grounds adjacent to Prounces house, bought by the parish in 1516 and originally occupied by John Prouns in 1399. The Tudor school building is still currently in use. There were reportedly boarders in this building for part of its history, as reputedly there were much later at Enfield Court (the Lower School). On the dissolution of the chantries in 1547 the rights to the charitable property passed to the Crown. However, the Court of Augmentations questioned and challenged the King's title so that in 1550 the property was restored. In 1553 Queen Mary relinquished all claims and in 1558 an attempt was made to endow a school with the Poynetts estate. Unfortunately, a proposed trustee died before <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deed,</b> which meant a second deed granted only £6 13s. 4d. just sufficient for the salary of the former chantry priest who established a school, the remainder being used for the relief of the poor. Thus from 1558 a schoolmaster began teaching the children of Enfield's poor Latin and English 'according to the trade and use of grammar schools'. In 1586 William Garrett left £50 to build a schoolhouse, and this money is presumed to have been used to erect the Tudor building which is still in use and stands adjacent to the west of St. Andrew's Church.|$|R
