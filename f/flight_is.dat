5|$|When {{taking off}} from the ground the <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> ungainly, with much {{flapping}} of wings. The bird's black wingtips are visible while {{it is in the}} air and once it gathers speed, its <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> much more graceful and it often ascends to great heights. Here it may be barely discernible as it wheels in great circles, sometimes emitting its hoarse cry.|$|E

5|$|Starlings and mynas {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> strong and direct {{and most are}} very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
25|$|More than 280 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{cancelled}} at Heathrow airport, over 120 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled at Doncaster Sheffield Airport and 80 more <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due {{to health}} and safety reasons at Manchester Airport. Many <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed at Ireland's airports {{on the morning of}} 19 January due to the high winds in Ireland, however by afternoon they were delayed because of high winds elsewhere in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|...Notes: <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Keflavik-Bergen-Stavanger-Keflavik. <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Stavanger-Sandefjord-Copenhagen. This <b>is</b> why the <b>flight</b> {{departs from}} the {{domestic}} terminal.|$|R
25|$|All {{flights in}} and out of Heathrow were halted for a short time after the accident. When {{operations}} resumed, many long-haul outbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> either delayed or cancelled, and all short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled {{for the rest of the}} day. Some inbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed, and 24 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> diverted to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. In an attempt to minimise further travel disruptions, Heathrow Airport received dispensation from the Department for Transport to operate some night flights. Even so, the following day (18 January) a total of 113 short-haul <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> cancelled due to crews and aircraft being out of position.|$|R

50|$|When {{the fourth}} <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> first {{announced}} in August 2008, {{shortly after the}} third <b>flight</b> failed, it <b>was</b> planned for launch in September. The rocket {{that was used to}} conduct the test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> originally built to launch the RazakSAT satellite. The test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the launch schedule because Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) required a successful <b>flight</b> to <b>be</b> conducted before RazakSAT could be launched.|$|R

40|$|Wind velocity, light intensity, soil temperature, vapor {{pressure}} {{deficit in the}} colony, {{vapor pressure}} deficit at {{the surface of the}} flight slits, and vapor pressure deficit at 1 m above the soil were measured during the swarming season. The vapor pressure deficits and soil temperature were not critical factors for <b>flight</b> since they <b>were</b> in a favorable range during the observation period. Light intensity had to drop to 10. 8 lumen/m 2 before <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated when the light was reduced to 0. 14 lumen/m 2. Light intensity, however, was not limiting since the intensity dropped every evening. The key microenvironmental factor regulating <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> the wind velocity at the <b>flight</b> slits. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated if the wind velocity was below 3. 7 km/h. If the wind increased to over 3. 7 km/h after <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> started, <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated...|$|R

5|$|The {{sunbirds}} and spiderhunters {{are very}} small passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. <b>Flight</b> <b>is</b> fast and direct on their short wings.

5|$|This small martin's <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} {{slow and}} leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The calls {{are similar to those of}} the Eurasian crag martin and include a soft chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Superman: Ultimate <b>Flight</b> <b>is</b> themed after DC Comics' Superman character. The {{track of all}} three rides is red, with yellow rails and blue supports.

The installations at Six Flags Great America and Six Flag Great Adventure have dedicated gift shops near the ride's exit that sell a variety of DC Comics merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. <b>Flight</b> <b>is</b> an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
5|$|Longacre's obverse of {{an eagle}} in <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> {{based on that}} of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small {{quantities}} from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. <b>Flight</b> <b>is</b> {{the primary means}} of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
