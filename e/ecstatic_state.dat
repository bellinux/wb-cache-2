It was here that she followed a demanding schedule of eight hours of reflection which was offered in silence and solitude. In addition she devoted four {{hours of the night}} to various forms of mortification which included flagellation and the wearing of a crown of thorns. In terms of nourishment she fasted on bread and water alone and took the Eucharist as her sole form of sustenance while was sometimes seen in an <b>ecstatic</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

25|$|His {{attitude}} toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, {{as far as they}} {{can be traced back to}} the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God, he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things. His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion. He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an <b>ecstatic</b> <b>state</b> in which they might behold the heavenly halls ("hekalot") as vividly as if they really had entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura, he followed former scholars in deeming it not impossible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy. But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.|$|E

50|$|Between 1968 and {{the late}} 1980s, Fischer {{developed}} a model for altered states of consciousness in several stages known as the perception-hallucination continuum.

Normal consciousness resides {{in the middle of the}} continuum. On the other end are the hypoaroused states, such as those experienced during samadhi, separated by tranquil states, for example during Zen meditation.|$|R

For example, in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, the author, M., later identified as Mahendranath Gupta, recounts observing Ramakrishna Paramahamsas introverted mood in which he became [...] "unconscious of the outer world."

50|$|In {{the ancient}} {{mediterranean}} world, the Cult of Dionysus and the Orphic mysteries used wine {{as part of}} their religious practices.

Religious drinking festivals called Bacchanalia were popular in Italy and associated with the gods Bacchus and Liber. These Dionysian rites were frequently outlawed by the Roman Senate.|$|R
5000|$|According to Ian Whicher, {{the status}} of sananda and sasmita in Patanjali's system {{is a matter of}} dispute. According to Maehle, the first two constituents, {{deliberation}} and reflection, form the basis of the various types of samapatti. According to Feuerstein, [...] "Joy" [...] and [...] "I-am-ness" ... must be regarded as accompanying phenomena of every coginitive ecstacy. The explanations of the classical commentators on this point appear to be foreign to Patanjali's hierarchy of <b>ecstatic</b> <b>states,</b> and it seems unlikely that ananda and asmita should constitute independent levels of samadhi.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the second century Montanist (c. 170 CE) {{movement}} and the possible correlation of it with pagan prophecy. Rather than accepting prophets who spoke in ecstasy, the cultural understanding of the early church condemned prophecy in <b>ecstatic</b> <b>states</b> due to their pagan associations. Contrary to contemporary ideas that Christian prophecy was ecstatic, there is no evidence that early Christian prophets engaged in ecstatic behavior when they prophesied. Max Weber’s and I. M.

5000|$|That {{the longing}} to transcend oneself is [...] "one of the {{principal}} appetites of the soul" [...] is questioned by Zaehner. There are still {{people who do not}} feel this desire to escape themselves, and religion itself need not mean escaping from the ego. Zaehner criticises what he sees as Huxley's apparent call for all religious people to use drugs (including alcohol) as part of their practices. Quoting St Paul's proscriptions against drunkenness in church, in 1 Corinthians xi, Zaehner makes the point that artificial <b>ecstatic</b> <b>states</b> and spiritual union with God are not the same.|$|R
