40|$|The {{financial}} perspective of 2000 - 2006 has fundamentally changed {{the relationship between}} the EU’s budget and its policies. Whereas prior to this perspective, the EU maintained a policy-driven budget; in its aftermath, Community policies became budget-driven. Since then, the latter has been the prevailing tendency. The major factor behind the budget-driven policies is the strong juste retour approach, where Member States, as their primary goal in budgetary debates, attempt to optimise their net position against the Union’s budget. The priority of the net position is rooted in the EU’s failing <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> system. Instead of <b>genuine</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources,</b> three-quarters of the budget is financed by GNI-based resources. The autonomy of the common budget and the reintroduction of policy-driven budget planning could only be ensured by (1) a <b>genuine</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> system based on the resources generated by Community policies, or (2) a specific Community tax, or a combination of the two. This raises significant questions concerning further Member State sovereignty sharing and their overall readiness for fiscal and political integration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general {{overview of the}} EU’s <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> system, and of the debate on its possible reform within the current legal framework. Two alternative reforms are discussed, along with their possible advantages and drawbacks: 1) a simplified system based only on a resource related to gross national income; and 2) {{the introduction of new}} <b>genuine</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and the possible elimination of some current <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The second option, which has long been called for by the European Parliament, is explored in further detail, with an overview of the potential candidates for new <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> analysed by the European Commission prior to its 2011 reform proposal. The current outlook for a possible reform focuses on the ongoing work of the high-level group on <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> chaired by Professor Mario Monti, presenting the main obstacles to change and possible ways forward.

40|$|The {{system for}} {{financing}} the EU today {{is on its}} last legs. Indeed, with the EU budget being predominantly financed by national contributions, member states attach great importance to what they get in return, which in the end affects the European principle of solidarity and makes every budgetary negotiation a potential arena for political blockage. The economic and financial crisis, with its corresponding increase in the public deficit of member states, has unfortunately worsened the situation. Fully funding the European Union with <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> {{is the only way}} to put an end to the fair return approach and to make the necessary changes to EU spending that would provide it with the financial means equal to its needs and allow it to face the challenges of the future. On the eve of the presentation of a new proposal for <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> announced by the European Commission, Jutta Haug, Alain Lamassoure and Guy Verhofstadt, Members of the European Parliament belonging to three different political groups, have brought together their views and present this report as their contribution to the debate. Economists Daniel Gros and Paul De Grauwe of CEPS and Gaëtane Ricard-Nihoul and Eulalia Rubio of Notre Europe have collaborated with them in this important project They demonstrate in this report that fully financing an EU budget of the size it is today with <b>genuine</b> <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> is not a dream but that such a change is feasible, provided that the political will to reform the current system can be summoned. Moreover, they find that it would not infringe on the member states’ fiscal sovereignty. On the contrary, it would reinforce the link between the European Union and its citizens, putting an end to member states' tendency to calculate their net returns and possibly even enabling them to make cuts to their public expenditure. Finally, such a reform would represent a return to the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Rome, which contained a clear aspiration for financial autonomy and which prevailed until the end of the 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} serious criticisms of the status quo with respect to the EU budget {{represents}} the lack of a link between the EU policy and the system of <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Strengthening the link between reaching smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and the EU system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by introducing tax-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> could contribute to decrease the existing sustainability gaps in taxation in the European Union. This research demonstrates that the introduction of the Common (Consolidated) Corporate Tax Base (hereinafter as C(C) CTB) could be an important contribution to close the existing sustainability gaps in tax regimes in the EU. To research the revenue potential of the C(C) CTB, a model based on a remittance system was designed. The system foresees the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> (resp. GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resource)</b> through the transfer of a part of the corporate tax revenues based on the C(C) CTB raised on the national level to the EU budget. The results of the research show that the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> would be able to fully replace the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource,</b> with the only exception of Cyprus. However, the C(C) CTB-based <b>own</b> <b>resource</b> cannot be considered to be a sufficient resource to fully replace the GNI-base <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> Therefore, we recommend C(C) CTB only in connection with the replacement of the VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resource.</b> FairTa...|$|R

40|$|Although  the  responsibility  for  realizing  the  Europe   2020  strategy  is  shared  between the EU and its 28 member states, {{the main}} {{criticism}} of the current EU budget relates {{to the lack of}} a link between the budget and Europe 2020  strategy.  Therefore a new  budget design as well as alternative revenue sources is currently explored within a  mid-term review. One of the possible candidates is a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on  a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> by the transfer of the tax revenues from a FTT raised on a national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> would be able to fully replace GNI-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> and VAT-based <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> only for some EU member states. However, the results also show that, from the EU 11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU 11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source Member State.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the EU financing reform, where the lump-sum tax is considered as an alternative source of revenue. The purpose of this study stems out of the current debate related to the EU budget reform, where tax-based own-resources are required to replace the current system of <b>own</b> <b>resources</b> of the EU budget. The novelty of this research arises from the evaluation of a hypothetical EU lump-sum tax as a future replacement of GNI and VAT-based EU budget own sources. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the potential of a lump-sum tax as a source of future EU funding. We consider lump-sum tax as an EU per capita charge applicable to all citizens of 28 EU member states. In order to assess the lump-sum tax potential we simulate five different lump-sum tax rates and compare the obtained yield to current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> The results of the research show that a charge per capita in the EU does not have the capacity to fully replace GNI or VAT-based EU <b>own</b> <b>resources.</b> Therefore, we consider the EU per capita charge as a form of complementary source to fund the EU own budget, with no real potential to fully replace the current EU <b>own</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
