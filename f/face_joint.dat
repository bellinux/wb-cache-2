The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that begins {{at the site of}} a tick bite about a week after it has occurred. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 25–50% of infected people do not develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headache and feeling tired. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the <b>face,</b> <b>joint</b> pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs.

40|$|The use of {{adhesive}} {{joining in}} mechanical structures, especially in industrial usage, is rapidly increasing. However, {{to be confident}} in their use {{it is essential to}} evaluate the performance of the joints, especially when their strength tends to decrease upon exposure to warm and humid conditions that cause degradation. Since degradation is a long time process and evaluating the degradation of adhesive joints in normal condition needs several months or years tests, accelerated test under controlled environment is unavoidable. Water can affect both the physical and mechanical properties of the adhesive itself and also the nature of the interface or interphase that exists between it and the substrate. The aim of this thesis is considering both aspects, including also other factors that can affect the durability of bonded joints. To obtain in short time experimental data on the degradation of adhesives exposed to moisture or immersed in water, a valuable technique is represented by the open-face configuration. Apart from the acceleration of moisture uptake which is obtained due to the larger area exposed, a further advantage is the uniformity of degradation. A further acceleration can be obtained by adding a hygroscopic contaminant at the adhesive/adherend interface, which speeds up moisture uptake and accentuates the interfacial nature of the failure. The decay of the mechanical strength in absence or presence of a contaminating agent was evaluated. The effects of a humid and warm environment and also immersion in water on tensile strength, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of a twocomponent epoxy adhesive, Henkel Hysol 3425, were evaluated using bulk specimens,. To relate the exposure time to the moisture uptake, measurements were performed for both bulk adhesive specimens and bonded open <b>face</b> <b>joint,</b> in periods of time between 1 and 3 months {{depending on the type of}} test, exposure to warm moisture or immersion in water. In a further part of the work, the performance of different surface pretreatment techniques of aluminum open-faced single lap joints was evaluated. Four different surface treatment processes were tested, namely: Degreasing and Roughening, treating with Picklex 20, Phosphoric Acid Anodizing (PAA) without and with contamination. Finally, the effect of warm moisture on the fracture energy of an epoxy-based adhesives was measured. To evaluate the effect on fracture energy and other related parameters, open-faced double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens of epoxy-steel adhesive system were exposed to warm moisture, at 100 % relative humidity and 50 °C. The methodology introduced in this thesis leads to further investigation on the durability of the considered adhesive (in terms of joint strength, water uptake measurements, fracture energy, etc) under different environmental conditions. The methods adopted to accelerate the degradation process (open face and contamination) revealed an interesting reduction in duration of degradation process. Surface preparation methods to protect aluminum bonded joints against severe environmental condition were evaluated and the most suitable one (PAA process) was identifie...|$|E

The study adopted a descriptive research design and purposive sampling. Multiple sources of evidence was used to collect information mainly literature review, questionnaires and interviews. Key findings reveal that legal and statutory requirements in the formation of joint ventures include registration by Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA), Contractors Registration Board (CRB) and under Registration of Documents Act (RDA). All JV respondents were registered by BRELA and CRB which are mandatory but only 7 were registered by RDA. Most important factors considered during formation of JVs are: contract agreement, financial stability and commitment while key risks associated with JVs are cultural and social differences, delays in approvals and financial risks. In addition, main challenges <b>facing</b> <b>joint</b> ventures are: identification of possible risks and joint venture agreement interpretation. The study concludes that formation of JVs have been addressing some of emerging challenges facing local construction organizations despite the risks and challenges that exist.

40|$|Part I: Surgical Tool Design. The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the development of a}} surgical tool to implant a specialized micro-scale sensor into the anterior chamber of a mouse eye. The sensor measures intra-ocular pressure continuously under normal living conditions, creating a measurement system that is needed in the field of Glaucoma research. The sensor has a complex geometry comprised of both compliant and non-compliant materials, and requires careful handling. ^ Previously, the surgical procedure required three separate tools; a knife, a syringe and needle, and forceps. That procedure suffered from issues of ease of use, efficiency, safety and reliability. The objective was to design, fabricate, and test a single unified tool that could perform all necessary surgical functions. The motivation for unifying the toolset into a single device was primarily to improve surgical efficiency and ease of use. ^ The development of the surgical tool faced a number of different challenges. These issues pertained to creating a sharp cutting instrument within unusual geometrical constraints, loading the sensor into a narrow tube, delivering both fluid and an object through the same tube, optimizing dimensions against competing constraints, and satisfying the ergonomic needs of the surgeon. ^ Two generations of prototypes were fabricated and tested. The second generation prototype was comprised of three telescoping tubes, each with a specific function. All three surgical steps were successfully carried out on a cadaver pig eye, with minor complications in the handling of the tool. Due to inherent design constraints in the implant and available materials, the size of the tool is likely more appropriate for the anatomy of a larger animal. ^ Part II: The Effects of Leg Morphology on Running Performance. The secondary {{objective of this}} thesis was to explore how differences in joint morphology impact the dynamics and energetics of running. An analysis was completed on the effects of kinematic knee orientation on legged locomotion, specifically simple running patterns. ^ The analysis compared the dynamics of a forward facing knee found in humans, a rear facing ankle found in birds, and a linear knee found in pogo sticks and simple robots. ^ The equations of motion for the models reveal that joint orientation has a direct effect on the dynamics of the system. The early simulation results show that leg morphology directly effects deflection and force patterns, which in turn effects the trajectory of the system. In forward <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque increases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of higher compliance in the leg. In rear <b>facing</b> <b>joints,</b> hip torque decreases ground reaction forces, creating the appearance of lower compliance in the leg. The results suggest that a forward <b>facing</b> knee <b>joint</b> found in humans is more energy efficient than a rear <b>facing</b> ankle <b>joint</b> found in birds. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDermatomyositis (DM) is a multisystem {{inflammatory}} disorder primarily {{affecting the}} skin and muscles. Its pathophysiology is still very poorly understood, but humoral and cellular immune dysregulation is apparent. Diagnosis of DM is based on five criteria: proximal limb muscle weakness, serum muscle enzyme elevation, histopathologic muscle abnormalities on muscle biopsy, electromyographic abnormalities, and clinical inflammatory dermatological manifestations (heliotrope rash, poikiloderma, and inflammatory lesions on the hands and <b>facing</b> <b>joints).</b> DM is frequently associated with certain cancers, and may appear before, concurrent with, or after diagnosis of cancer. DM {{has been reported to}} be associated with approximately one per 1000 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Treatment is based on long-course nonselective immunosuppression, particularly corticosteroids, by general route, even when malignancy is present, but new-targeted therapies may modify the treatment strategy in the near future. Despite iatrogenic immunosuppression, the prognosis of nasopharyngeal cancer is not worse in patients with paraneoplastic DM. We report one case as an illustration of this paraneoplastic course (evolving in parallel with the cancer), and to make an update on the state of knowledge on paraneoplastic DM in such cancers...|$|R

In this work, we explore using identification signals to supervise one CNN and the combination of semi-verification and identification to train the other one. In order to estimate semi-verification loss at a low computation cost, a circle, which is composed of all faces, is used for selecting face pairs from pairwise samples. In the process of face normalization, we propose using different landmarks of faces {{to solve the problems}} caused by poses. In addition, the final face representation is formed by the concatenating feature of each deep CNN after principal component analysis (PCA) reduction. Furthermore, each feature is a combination of multi-scale representations through making use of auxiliary classifiers.

Liquidity risk matters in an imperfect capital market where interim losses on a futures position {{have to be}} financed at a borrowing rate that {{is higher than the}} risk-free rate.

This paper analyzes the optimal risk management and production decisions of a risk-averse firm that <b>faces</b> <b>joint</b> price and liquidity risk and can trade derivatives in unbiased markets. Its main contribution is to provide a rationale for the use of futures and options on futures in imperfect capital markets for risk management purposes. The analytical results show that there is a hedging role for option on futures: If liquidity risk materializes, the firm sells options on futures in order to partly cover this liquidity need. The additional exposure to price risk created by the options position is partly offset by an adjustment of the futures position. Otherwise, no options are traded and the optimal futures position is a full hedge. Numerical results show that the existence of liquidity risk reduces the optimal futures hedge ratio and that options are not normally used before a liquidity need actually arises.
