40|$|Traditionally, the {{efficacy}} of an anticancer agent has been measured by response rate. With the development of biological molecular-targeted agents, which have a different mechanism of action from conventional agents, it may be appropriate to consider alternative criteria that reflect {{the positive effect of}} these biological agents on disease control, palliation, symptom improvement and quality of life. One such targeted agent is the orally active epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (‘Iressa’, ZD 1839). This article reviews the clinical experience of patients with advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, who have received gefitinib as part of a clinical trial or through the ‘Iressa’ <b>Expanded</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Programme.</b> Disease-control rates of ∼ 50 % were observed in some <b>Expanded</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Programme</b> series, comparable with results obtained from Phase II trials. Symptom improvement was also reported. Information that will help identify those patients most likely to respond to treatment will become increasingly important. Therefore, the possible role of prognostic markers and the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor status and response to gefitinib has been investigated. No clear association between epidermal growth factor receptor expression and response was observed. Future studies of other biomarkers in the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway should help to identify which patients are likely to benefit most from gefitinib...|$|E

40|$|Background &# 38; Aims Direct-acting antivirals {{have become}} widely used for {{patients}} with chronic hepatitis C virus infection with decompensated cirrhosis. Virological responses are excellent and early improvements in liver function, {{at least in a}} proportion of patients, have been observed but the longer term impact of viral clearance on end-stage liver disease complications is unclear. Methods: Prospective study of patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received 12 weeks of all-oral direct-acting antivirals through the English <b>Expanded</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Programme.</b> Endpoints were deaths, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, serious decompensation events, sepsis or hospitalisations, and MELD scores between start of therapy to 15 months post-treatment start.

40|$|Background: 'Compassionate use' {{programmes}} allow {{medicinal products}} that are not authorised, but are in the development process, to {{be made available to}} patients with a severe disease who have no other satisfactory treatment available to them. We sought to understand how such programmes are regulated in ten European Union countries. Methods: The European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) conducted a comprehensive survey on clinical research regulatory requirements, including questions on regulations of 'compassionate use' programmes. Ten European countries, covering approximately 70 % of the EU population, were included in the survey (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK). Results: European Regulation 726 / 2004 /EC is clear on the intentions of 'compassionate use' programmes and aimed to harmonise them in the European Union. The survey reveals that different countries have adopted different requirements and that 'compassionate use' is not interpreted in the same way across Europe. Four of the ten countries surveyed have no formal regulatory system for the programmes. We discuss the need for 'compassionate use' programmes and their regulation where protection of patients is paramount. Conclusions: 'Compassionate use' is a misleading term and should be replaced with 'expanded access'. There is a need for <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> in order to serve the interests of seriously ill patients who have no other treatment options. To protect these patients, European legislation needs to be more explicit and informative with regard to the regulatory requirements, restrictions, and responsibilities in <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Five {{targeted}} {{agents have}} shown efficacy in advanced renal cell carcinoma. These agents were evaluated in pivotal phase III clinical trials using different treatment settings and different patient populations. As patients encountered in 'real life' clinical practice are frequently under-represented in phase III trials, making treatment {{decisions based on}} phase III data alone may have limitations. In order to support treatment decisions for patients who do not fit within the inclusion criteria of many phase III trials, physicians must consider additional data sources such as <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> <b>programmes,</b> sub- and retrospective analyses, and also clinical experience. The suitability of a specific targeted agent for a given patient group, e. g. elderly, will depend {{on a number of}} factors, including disease-, patient- and treatment-related characteristics. Here, we identify the need for an individualised patient-focused approach to the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma in clinical practice. In order to optimise therapy for individual patients, we present a schema providing guidance on the wide range of parameters that should be considered when making treatment decisions. We recommend the integration of this approach into everyday clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Elderly {{patients}} with metastatic melanoma have different disease characteristics and a poorer prognosis than younger patients. Data from clinical trials and <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> (EAPs) suggest ipilimumab confers a consistent survival benefit {{and has a}} similar safety profile across different age groups of {{patients with}} metastatic melanoma. Here we report the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab 3  mg/kg in elderly patients enrolled in an EAP in Italy. Patients aged[*]>[*] 70  years with pretreated melanoma received ipilimumab 3  mg/kg every 3  weeks for four doses through an EAP. Tumour response was evaluated at baseline and after completion of induction therapy using immune-related response criteria and patients were monitored throughout the treatment period for adverse events (AEs), including immune-related AEs. The immune-related disease control rate among 188 evaluable patients was 38 %, including four patients with an immune-related complete response, 24 with an immune-related partial response and 44 with immune-related stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4. 0  months and the 1 - and 2 -year PFS rates were 21 % and 12 %, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 8. 9  months; 1 - and 2 -year OS rates were 38 % and 22 %, respectively. The safety profile of ipilimumab was consistent with that observed {{in the general population}} of the Italian EAP and treatment-related AEs generally resolved within a median of 2  weeks with treatment as per protocol-specific guidelines. These results suggest ipilimumab is a feasible treatment option in elderly patients with metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab treatment was generally well tolerated and resulted in clinical benefit and extended survival in elderly patients treated at centres in Italy...|$|R

40|$|Brain metastases are {{a common}} {{complication}} of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The role of chemotherapy {{in the treatment of}} brain metastases has not been clearly defined. Emerging case reports of patients with recurrent NSCLC treated as part of the <b>Expanded</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Programme</b> reveal that gefitinib (‘Iressa’, ZD 1839) has clinical activity in some patients with brain metastases. Here, we describe a number of case studies documenting the response of patients with brain metastases to treatment with gefitinib. Many of these patients had quality-of-life benefits with improvement of neurological and systemic symptoms; some had a partial response of their brain metastases and even complete responses have been seen in a few patients. One case report also describes a durable long-term response with concurrent treatment with gefitinib and radiotherapy. Such results call for larger trials designed to evaluate and define the role of gefitinib in the treatment of brain metastases in NSCLC patients, either as a single agent or in combination with radiation therapy...|$|E

40|$|Gefitinib (‘Iressa’, ZD 1839), an {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has recently been approved in several countries for use in advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In contrast to chemotherapies, which are generally used at or near their maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), gefitinib is used at an optimal biological dose (250 [*]mg[*]day− 1), which is substantially below its MTD, minimising the risk of adverse events without compromising efficacy. Tolerability data from the compassionate use of gefitinib in the ‘Iressa’ <b>Expanded</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Programme</b> support the favourable safety profile of the agent reported in Phase I and II trials. In both settings, the majority of adverse drug reactions were mild/moderate and consisted mainly of grade 1 / 2 diarrhoea and skin rash. Although skin rash has been suggested to predict response to gefitinib, available data do not support this hypothesis. Overall, these tolerability data demonstrate that gefitinib has a relatively benign side-effect profile and is a well-tolerated treatment option for patients with previously treated NCSLC, who currently have few alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Trastuzumab is a {{humanised}} {{monoclonal antibody}} against the extracellular domain of HER 2 (human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor- 2) that is overexpressed in about 25 % of human breast cancers.

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of retreatment with ipilimumab 3 mg kg(- 1) among patients participating in an <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> <b>programme</b> in Italy. Patients who achieved disease control during induction therapy were retreated with ipilimumab upon progression (3 mg kg(- 1) every 3 weeks for up to four doses), providing they had not experienced toxicity that precluded further dosing.

Of these, 28 (55 %) regained disease control upon retreatment and 42 % were alive 2 years after the first induction dose of ipilimumab; median overall survival was 21 months. Eleven patients (22 %) had a treatment-related adverse event of any grade during retreatment. These were generally mild-to-moderate and resolved within a median of 4 days.
