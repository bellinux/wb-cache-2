40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calculate straightening stroke precisely for automatic straightening machines. But, the existing mathematic models for calculating straightening stroke can not solve this problem well. In this paper, the mathematic load-deflection model, which reflects elastic range, elastic-plastic range and elastic spring back of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process, is developed. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. By simplicity, the rectangular section part is selected for study and {{is assumed to be}} the ideal elastic-plastic material. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics theory, through deriving relationships among the load, bending moment, deflection and elastic region length, the theoretical model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process has been established. Finally, two examples are calculated. The results calculated by the model are in good agreement with the results computed by FEM. Experimental data also show that the calculation results by the model is exact and the error is small. So the validity and the accuracy of the model are verified. It will be helpful to the development of automatic straightening machines...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{straightening}} precision of flexible automatic straightening machine, {{a new way of}} establishing straightening model and predicting straightening stroke is proposed based on bending experiment. In this paper, aiming at the LG series linear guide rails, the mathematical load-stroke model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process is established based on elastic-plastic theory. The stroke-deflection model can be obtained by simulating the bending process of guide rails based on loading-unloading FEA analysis. And then the precision straightening model of predicting straightening stroke, which is describe as a simplicity formula, can be fit out based on establishing compensation knowledge base achieved from bending experiment and experimental data processing. The experimental results verify this method's feasibility. It will be helpful to the development of automatic straightening machine's control system...|$|R
40|$|The {{straightening}} technics is one {{of important}} means to improve the straightness of metal bar. A novel way of predicting the straightening stroke is proposed based on mathematical methods and bending experimental and numerical simulation. The experimental and numerical simulation is conducted by following the mathematical load-stroke model of <b>press</b> <b>straightening</b> process under the elastic-plastic theory. For the linear guide rails, as an example, the stroke-deflection model focusing on the straightening stroke prediction {{can be achieved by}} contrasting and integrating the bending experimental results and finite element methods (FEM) simulation data. And then the formula for predicting the straightening stroke is presented based on the precise straightening stroke-deflection model. The stroke prediction formula with high precision {{can be applied to the}} straightening stroke prediction in the high straightness metal bar manufacturing process and automatic straightening machine conveniently...|$|R

Her meeting with Mahatma Gandhi resulted in a royal proclamation by which all the public roads (except the eastern road) to Vaikom Mahadeva Temple were opened to all castes. She also amended the Travancore Nayar Act in relation to the Marumakkathayam system of inheritance and family. Eventually in 1928, the matrilineal system was altogether done away with, introducing patrilineal nuclear family system among Nairs. At the same time, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi was criticized by social reformers for not allowing temple entry for dalits and also for preventing Jawaharlal Nehru from entering the Padmanabhaswamy Temple as Nehru had undertaken a sea voyage.

40|$|M. A. University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities (Journalism and Media Studies), 2012 The {{relationship}} between {{governments and the}} media has historically been an antagonistic one, and investigative journalism – the material manifestation {{of the role of}} the press as fourth estate – is central to this antagonism. In their capacity as the fourth estate, those newspapers that pursue and publish investigative journalism stand in opposition to government. Governments have responded to this opposition in a variety of ways; mostly, however, by way of legislated censorship of the press. In South Africa, the legislation that regulated what newspapers could print under apartheid was unusually vast. In spite of this, major exposés of government corruption – and worse – were seen on the front pages of those publications that pursue investigations into political malfeasance. In South Africa’s post-apartheid democracy, with constitutional protection of the freedom of expression, there has been increasing evidence of what Jackson has called the “embedded qualities of intolerance and secrecy” (1993 : 164) in the state’s response to revelations of corruption in the press, culminating in the Protection of State Information Bill that was passed in Parliament in November 2011. The passing of the Bill has resulted in widespread concern about the possibility of legislated, apartheid-style censorship of the media and freedom of expression. I interviewed five editors who were part of exposing state corruption during and after apartheid, in order to establish what motivates their decisions to keep on printing stories that brings them into conflict with the political powers of the day, in spite of the financial consequences for their publications. Regardless of the different political landscapes, the strategies that they followed in order to keep on publishing were remarkably similar, as is their reason for continuing to publish investigative stories: they believe it embodies the role of the press in a democracy. Indicators are that editors will keep on publishing, in spite of attempts by the government to <b>gag</b> the <b>press...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} an ergonomically adapted spacer block, used for manual work in a <b>straightening</b> <b>press.</b> This thesis has been performed at Scania Ferruform in Lulea, Sweden, which is an industrial enterprise producing e. g. rear axle bridges used in Scania AB trucks and buses. The report has been performed according to Lulea University of Technology (LTU) guidelines for a thesis work á 15 HP. The results of the thesis presents a multi designed prototype solution of a spacer block which is designed to be highly flexible and solve an ergonomically complex work moment. The solution for example solves heavy lifts by reducing weight and introduces more ergonomically work position and movements. The results should still continue to be verified before going into the live work process, this to reduce risks and pass validations which is not within the scope of this thesis. Three concept solutions have been evaluated after research and identification of the problem. Theoretical studies, work experiences, sketches, available solutions and limitations have been applied to analyze three prototype solutions. Each of the selected prototypes have been designed to a 3 D CAD model and produced to be tested and evaluated in a live working environment with a concept selection matrix. Integrations to find the best applicable solutions have been performed in coherence with design and production personel at Scania Ferruform, but also discussed with supervisors at LTU. Recommendation of future implementations, verifications and alternative solutions is handed over in this thesis, but also with internal communication to secure Scania Ferruforms’s confidentially agreements.
