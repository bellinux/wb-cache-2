25|$|The {{industrialisation}} of Hong Kong was rapid from 1963 through 1970. Pre-existing industries {{continued to}} prosper, while new industries emerged and blossomed as well. The number of factories increased 1.67 {{times and the}} number of workers increased by 1.15 times. The number of factories and workers in 1970 were 16,507 and 549,000 respectively. The latter took up over 40% of the city's <b>employment</b> <b>structure.</b> The value of domestic exports continued to rise, and in just two years, rose by 2.72 times to HK$12,347,000,000. Hong Kong was no longer reliant on re-exportation and became an industrialised city.|$|E

However, post-communist countries, while being only middle-income economies, have also experienced deindustrialisation. Building on the model developed by Rowthorn and Wells (1987) we explain this phenomenon and {{show that there is}} a strong negative relationship between the magnitude of deindustrialisation and the efficiency and consistency of market reforms.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{differentiated}} <b>employment</b> <b>structures</b> of the European regions, their evolution {{over time and}} their implications for economic growth. The analysis focuses {{on the distribution of}} employment between the main productive sectors over the period 1983 – 1997 in 145 regions of the EU. Some clusters of regions which are structurally similar are identified. Finally, in order to show the importance of the economic structure for long-run growth, the productive structures are related to convergence in per-capita incomes. The main results show that convergence and persistence in <b>employment</b> <b>structures</b> may coexist; structural differences are greater within rather than between countries; and, finally, convergence in incomes is improved by the homogenisation of productive structures, although the industrial sector maintains {{a key role in the}} growth processes...|$|R

Most of these jobs are in the construction sector. Manufacturing jobs account for only 3.3% of employment, compared with 9.6% for {{the state as a}} whole. On the other hand, the Cape Cod NECTA has the state’s highest percentages of employment in retail trade (17.9%, versus 11.1% for the state) and in leisure and hospitality (16.9%, versus 9.1% for the state). These numbers reflect the continuing importance to Cape Cod of summer tourism.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the issue if {{and to what}} extent young firms differ from incumbents regarding the use of non-standard employment, trust-based working time arrangements and overtime hours {{in the light of the}} qualitative changes of <b>employment</b> <b>structures</b> that are taking place in industrialized countries, such as rising shares of non-standard employment and borders between work and private life that become increasingly blurred. Based on a microeconometric analysis of the IAB Establishment Panel, a representative survey of about 16, 000 employers in Germany, we find that young establishments rely significantly more often on limited contracts and freelance work than incumbent businesses in order to hedge the higher risks and uncertainties of young firms. Likewise, trust-based working time arrangements and overtime hours are more an issue in young than in incumbent firms, indicating a higher level of subjectivated work in young firms. Additionally, we provide basic evidence that these differences are not purely transitory but on the contrary rather stable as the firms grow older, which makes young firms contribute a substantial part to the ongoing qualitative changes of <b>employment</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} extend the {{research}} on retirement in two ways. First, using a nationally representative sample, I attempt to clarify the relationship between gender and life satisfaction in retirement by explicitly considering how gender <b>structures</b> preretirement <b>employment</b> experiences. Second, I ask whether the "male model " of life satisfaction in retirement {{can be used to}} assess women's life satisfaction in retirement. It is hypothesized that <b>employment</b> <b>structures,</b> through their influence on sources of work satisfaction and world view, influence the sources of life satisfaction in retirement. While this hypothesis is generally supported, gender still appears to define a context for the variables of the male model beyond that encompassed by <b>employment</b> <b>structures.</b> The sources and implications of this gender influence for future social gerontological research, particularly in the area of retirement, are discussed. A CRUCIAL issue in the social sciences concerns the •** • extent to which theoretical insights derived from men's experiences can be generalized to women's.
