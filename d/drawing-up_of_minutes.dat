40|$|Processes of soft policy {{coordination}} in the EU and of Europeanization have {{in recent}} years mostly been conceptualised in terms of learning. The OMC is mostly seen as inducing ideational, cognitive and possibly normative learning between member states. However, the generalised learning assumption stands in sharp constrast with the little amount of empirical evidence provided so far by scholarly research. This contribution addresses the learning assumption by looking at two empirical processes of the OMC inclusion: the <b>drawing-up</b> <b>of</b> the National Action Plans (NAPs) in France and Germany, and the place of learning within this OMC, the peer reviews, in order to evaluate whether minimal conditions for supranational learning dynamics were given.

While this can to some degree be explained by institutional differences, the main explaining variable appears to be the lack of political will: at the domestic level, this lack hinders a synchronisation of the European and national agendas while at the European level, the same lack stands in the way of further positive integration. social policy; governance; open coordination; France; Germany; political science...|$|R

Problems of economical development of “Construction ” sphere was determined- high level of transactional costs which gives place to high cost of investment-building projects and products. Comparative analysis of the main economical-and-institutional indexes was represented. Two types of costs were singled out: 1) entrepreneurial costs arising as an answer to low level of organization of the investment-building market and lack of the established practice of counterparts interaction; 2) regulatory costs arising {{in the process of}} implementation by the entities of legislative rules and guidelines for <b>drawing-up</b> <b>of</b> contracts, proprietary rights and permits, licenses, approvals.

40|$|As {{reported}} in the scientific literature and mentioned in building energy performance legislation, the thermal inertia of the opaque building envelope can have a significant {{positive impact on the}} reduction of summer indoor overheating, of space cooling peak load and of electricity consumption. At {{the early stages of the}} envelope design, there is a need to use simplified as well as effective parameters to correctly characterize the thermal performance of the opaque envelope under dynamic conditions. In this work, a new methodology to describe the dynamic thermal behavior of opaque components is proposed. The approach is based on the harmonic parameters specified in ISO 13786 but it also takes into account realistic boundary conditions for different orientations and solar absorptance values. New equivalent thermal parameters are determined by means of dynamic simulations. The use of these parameters to assess the conduction heat flow rate by means of a simplified model is validated through a comparison with the results of a dynamic simulation. The method presented in the article represents an improvement with respect to the parameters usually applied at the early design stage to thermally characterize the opaque envelope of the building under dynamic conditions. In fact, it allows simplified but reliable performance parameters referring to actual boundary conditions to be obtained. The application potential of the proposed methodology lies in the <b>drawing-up</b> <b>of</b> catalogues and technical standards that supply the values of the new equivalent thermal parameters for different technical solutions...|$|R
