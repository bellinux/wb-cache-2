40|$|This study {{examines}} heterosexual experience of homosexual men. We observe occurrence of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> and sexual experience {{with women and}} men in personal history of a respondent. We compare feelings of excitement towards men and women in different situations and observe usage of sexual practices and precautions in sex life. We tested the hypothesis that individuals of older age group have more <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> and experience than younger individuals. We assumed higher occurrence of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> and <b>heterosexual</b> experience during the process of coming out. Another hypothesis is, that occurrence of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> and experience is higher in small towns. Last hypothesis is that homosexual individuals - believers have more <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> than nonbelievers. 100 participants answered questionnaires designed for this study. We obtained findings concerning sexual life of the participants. None of the hypothesis' was confirmed, although there are indications that if more representative set is found, the hypothesis would be most probably confirmed...|$|R

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship.</b> Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|Baumeister (2010) {{found that}} masochistic males {{experienced}} greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and cross dressing. Trends {{also suggested that}} male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship</b> should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that in BDSM, roles are not fixed to gender, but personal preferences. The dominant {{partner in a}} <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship</b> may be the woman rather than the man; or BDSM {{may be part of}} male/male or female/female sexual relationships. Finally, some people switch, taking either a dominant or submissive role on different occasions. Several studies investigating the possibility of correlation between BDSM pornography and the violence against women also indicate a lack of correlation. As an example, Japan is listed as the country with the lowest sexual crime rate out of all the industrialized nations, despite being known for its distinct BDSM and bondage pornography (see Pornography in Japan). In 1991 a lateral survey {{came to the conclusion that}} between 1964 and 1984, despite the increase in amount and availability of sadomasochistic pornography in the US, Germany, Denmark and Sweden there is no correlation with the national number of rapes to be found.|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focuses on}} the potential confusion of sexuality with gender in the novel. As Jay Prosser argues, “rightly tracing Hall’s debt to nineteenth-century sexologists, critics have wrongly reduced sexual inversion to homosexuality.” What many refer to as Stephen’s ‘butch lesbianism’, Prosser suggests, is actually a transgender identity. As a child, Stephen insists that s/he is male - “Yes, of course I’m a boy…I must be a boy ‘cause I feel exactly like one,” – and, when talking to her/his mother, Stephen claims that, “All my life I’ve never felt like a woman, and you know it.” Through Stephen’s final rejection of Mary, ostensibly so that Mary can participate in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship</b> with Martin and therefore have a more secure life, Prosser surmises that “Stephen affirms her identification with the heterosexual man”, thus rejecting lesbianism and instead aligning her/himself with the male.|$|E
500|$|For Duff, who {{stated that}} the song can be {{interpreted}} in many different ways, [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] {{tells the story of}} a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship,</b> in which the woman was in love with the man, but he was not [...] "as into her as she was him". After the couple break-up, she found herself in a place where she [...] "wasn't herself". She then [...] "comes out of her shell again", which Duff described as: [...] "Coming out again, dancing again, smiling again, having fun and seeing everything in a brighter light." [...] The Dead Executives were instrumental in the instrumentation of [...] "Beat of My Heart", performing on the bass and guitars. They also mixed and engineered the song; the latter was also conducted by Todd Parker and Grant Conway and assisted by Allan Hessler. It was mixed and recorded at the Foxy Studio in Los Angeles, California. The drums featured on the track was performed by Dean Butterworth while Monique Powell and The Fruit performed backing vocals.

500|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} '80s, when lesbian feminists {{rejected}} the butch and femme identities that Hall's novel {{had helped to}} define, writers like Jane Rule and Blanche Wiesen Cook criticised The Well for defining lesbianism in terms of masculinity, {{as well as for}} presenting lesbian life as [...] "joyless". Furthermore, The Well arguably embodies what modern readers may regard as misogynistic and biphobic ideas in its presentation of the femme women who experience attraction towards Stephen but eventually end up in heterosexual relationships. Mary’s femininity, in particular, is belittled by Hall’s presentation of her: she is not Stephen’s equal in age, education, family, or wealth, and so is constantly infantilised by her lover. This, coupled with Mary’s dependence on Stephen, seems to emphasise the supposed inferiority of the feminine to the masculine. As Clare Hemmings argues, Mary is merely used as “a means for Stephen to reach her own understanding of {{the true nature of the}} deviant’s plight.” Moreover, Hemmings continues that both Mary and Angela represent the “‘traitorous femme’ who remains untrustworthy as she may leave you [...] for a man.” The idea that Mary’s sexuality and seemingly genuine feelings for Stephen are invalidated by the possibility of her <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship</b> with Martin may seem biphobic to modern readers. Furthermore, Hall’s treatment of Mary as a dependant and a foil for Stephen’s masculinity seemingly degrades femme lesbianism, or femininity in itself, as innately untrustworthy and inferior to forms of masculinity, whether exhibited by men or women. Alternatively, some critics assert that The Well's queer significance extends beyond lesbianism, arguing that the novel provides important bisexual representation in literature.|$|E

40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Psychology) In the Republic of South Africa, {{there is}} a growing {{consciousness}} of the importance of sex education, and specifically of relationship education, for the youth. Research indicates that the peer group and the media are the main sources of information regarding <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships.</b> That these sources are not very reliable, is indicated by the fact that South Africa has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies (among all population groups) in the world. The additional threat of AIDS has shifted the responsibility for guidance regarding <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> increasingly towards institutions of education, such as schools, colleges and universities. Bearing this in mind, {{it stands to reason that}} student teachers should be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships.</b> This would not only aid their personal growth, but would be of immense value to them as teachers. The problem is that up to now only a few Colleges of Education in the R. S. A. have been offering limited training in family education. No college, however, offers a course exclusively directed to student teachers' own <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships.</b> Research was therefore undertaken to investigate the attitudes of student teachers in respect of those facets of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationships</b> which featured prominently in the literature studied, namely self concept, sexuality, sex roles, empathy and communication. The empirical component of the investigation was based on the implementation of a questionnaire, which was completed by all the students of an Afrikaans medium College of Education...|$|R

2500|$|Leading modern {{authorities}} in different Jewish religious movements {{differ in their}} interpretation of the law on homosexuality in [...] and [...] From Orthodox Judaism, in 2010, four leaders of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University posted {{a statement saying that}} the Torah absolutely prohibits homosexual behavior, and with respect to homosexuality, the study of Torah will place observant Jews at odds with political correctness and the temper of the times, but they must be honest with themselves and with God, regardless of the consequences. In 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism approved by a 13-to-12 vote a responsum that held that while the explicit biblical ban on anal sex between men remains in effect, for homosexuals who are incapable of maintaining a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>relationship,</b> the rabbinic prohibitions that have been associated with other gay and lesbian intimate acts are superseded based upon the Talmudic principle of the obligation to preserve the human dignity of all people, in effect normalizing the status of gay and lesbian Jews in the Jewish community, while explicitly not ruling on the question of gay marriage. In 1977, the Central Conference of American Rabbis of Reform Judaism adopted a resolution encouraging legislation to decriminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults and prohibit discrimination against them. And in 2013, the Central Conference of American Rabbis Responsa Committee adopted a responsum holding that Reform rabbis officiate with the full support of the CCAR at the marriage ceremonies of Jews of the same sex and Reform rabbis may consider these same-sex marriages to be kiddushin, utilizing in the marriage ceremony the Jewish forms and rites that are most appropriate to the partners involved.|$|E
