40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that discards and overexploitation produced by intense fishing activities {{are not only}} a risk for fisheries sustainability but also {{the cause of the}} marine resources decline, this involving significant changes in the trophic webs and habitats. This is especially the case of bottom trawl fisheries, and more specifically shrimp trawls, which produce average discards that can be higher than 70 % of catches. A Spanish shrimp fishery has been traditionally developed in West African fishing grounds, being especially relevant in Mauritanian waters, due to their high productivity. Since 2010, discards produced by this fishery have been studied from the information obtained through a “Program of scientific observers onboard” carried out by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Two annual observation cycles (2010 and 2014) have been conducted in Mauritania, giving information on catches and discards from a total of 996 (2014) and 1143 hauls (2010). More than 250 species were identified in the discards produced by this fleet. Cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed the occurrence of three well-defined assemblages, related to the depth fishery of the three main target species: one coastal shelf assemblage, in <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> of the southern pink shrimp Penaeus notialis (30 - 60 m depth), one slope assemblage in <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> of the deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris (90 - 300 m) and a deep slope assemblage in <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> of the striped red shrimp Aristeus varidens (300 - 900 m).

Tuna longline gear deployed more hooks between floats (mean = 26. 8), and the observed median depth of the deepest hook was 248 m (n = 266 sets). Maximum gear depth was predicted from estimates of the longline sag ratio and catenary algorithms; however, depth was not predicted for all TDR-monitored sets because estimating sag ratios proved problematic. Swordfish sets had less slack in the main line and correspondingly smaller catenary angles (median = 54. 2 ◦) than tuna sets (median = 63. 7 ◦). Median values of the predicted catenary depth were 123 m for swordfish sets (n = 203) and 307 m for tuna sets (n = 198). Shallow swordfish sets reached only ∼ 50 % of their predicted depth, while deeper tuna sets reached about 70 %. These values indicated that capture depths using traditional catenary equations may be biased {{without the benefit of}} TDRs affixed to longlines.

A total of 17 tags transmitted following the full deployment period, transmitting 25 - 82 % of the archived data; three tags were also physically returned, allowing for 100 % recovery of the archived data.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Since 2002, a {{total of}} 4, 358 {{derelict}} nets {{were removed from the}} Washington waters of the Salish Sea (WASS), 95 % of which were gillnets. I investigated the causes and rates of gillnet loss from the WASS commercial salmon fishery through interviews with fishers and industry professionals and analysis of historical fishing effort. Major causes of gillnet loss included lack of experience, operator error, equipment malfunction, overcrowding of fishing grounds, mismatch of net depth with ocean depth, and more. The findings suggest that gillnet loss is currently much less frequent than in previous decades characterized by heavy fishing effort (i. e., 1970 s - 1980 s). Analysis of net removal records identified patterns of association between net <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> and depths at which derelict nets are found. Spatial analysis and ArcGIS were used to produce a simple model capable of identifying areas of high, moderate and low probability of derelict gillnet occurrence.

40|$|Swordfish buoy gear (SBG) is a {{relatively}} new commercial fishery located off the eastern and southern coasts of Florida that began in 2002. The area targeted by this fishery has been closed to pelagic longline gear (PLL) since 2001. Swordfish buoy gear has largely taken the place of PLL as a commercial fishery for swordfish (Xiphias gladius) within the FEC. Conceptually, SBG is similar to a vertical longline, with free-floating individual buoys connected to approximately 100 meters of monofilament with one or two hooks constituting one “buoy. ” Most vessels currently using this gear are fishing approximately 10 “buoys” simultaneously. Due to the way each individual “buoy” drifts independently with the current, SBG is considered to fish more like PLL than the former NMFS classification of the “handgear” gear type. This study compared swordfish catch and bycatch rates between 56 sets of contemporary SBG field data and historical PLL observer data from the FEC. Catch was dominated by swordfish (91. 4 %), followed by sharks (6. 9 %). Analyses show higher swordfish catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for SBG vs. PLL (202. 4 to 31. 8 per 1000 hooks) and much lower bycatch rates for SBG, including no istiophorid billfish, marine mammal, or sea turtle bycatch during the 56 experimental sets. These data indicate that SBG is a cleaner and more efficient commercial fishery for swordfish in this area when compared to PLL. Additional work using small temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) indicate that the actual <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> (57. 3 m ± 19. 2 m) were much shallower than the predicted depths (71. 7 m ± 23. 7 m).

40|$|Determining {{the actual}} <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> of pelagic {{longline}} gear {{has long been}} a goal of fisheries science, largely for the standardization of fishing effort through the use of habitat‐oriented modeling. Early efforts to record these depths used large temperature‐depth recorders (TDRs) along the mainline, but more recent work with improved (smaller) technology has resulted in the deployment of hundreds of microTDRs on the gangions themselves to determine actual hook depths. The use of baited hooks on these gangions resulted in the occasional catch of a fish on a gangion equipped with a microTDR. These records are therefore useless from a gear behavior modeling perspective and have been previously disregarded. The collection of several hundred new and old microTDR records of caught pelagic fishes now allows some insight into actual post‐hooking fish behavior. A total of 490 records were examined from microTDR research by the senior author between 2003 and 2009, spanning 17 teleost and 13 elasmobranch species. Extracted data included time, temperature, and depth at hooking and death, and these were then matched with individual fish data, such as length. Analyses show a broad range of survival time on the hook, even within species. Hook location (internal versus external) and individual fish size were variable effects to the length of post‐hooking survival. For individuals that survived for multiple hours on the hook, three general patterns of movement were seen: surface association, constant vertical movement, and repeated vertical movement. Post‐hooking behavior patterns were consistent for some species (e. g., manta ray Manta sp.), but not others (e. g., swordfish Xiphias gladius). Not surprisingly, the two most commonly used estimators of hook depths consistently overestimated the hooking depths for most species, suggesting that subsequent population analyses based on these estimated depths may be suspect. These data indicate that the present hook depth predictor equations may not provide sufficient information to extrapolate individual species’ habitat utilization and, by extension, a strong rationale for their use in pelagic longline fishing gear standardization efforts...|$|E

With PSATs, both {{data collection and}} retrieval are fishery-independent. Previous research techniques have provided information on longer-term movements, migrations, and behavior patterns, {{but there is still}} a need for additional tagging studies with “second generation” tags with depth and light data and increased memory that will further define the short-duration activity patterns and habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish in the North Atlantic. PSATs have been successfully used on other large pelagic fishes, but have yet to be used on juvenile swordfish. This project will investigate four topics: the post-release survival rates of juvenile swordfish (defined as 3 ̆c 119 cm LJFL, the minimum domestic retention length) after being released from the recreational rod-and-reel fishery in the Florida Straits, habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish following release, an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of minimum size and bag limits in the recreational swordfish fishery, characterization of catch composition and disposition of the catch and bycatch. High-resolution PSAT technology will be used to estimate the post-release survival of 20 individual juvenile swordfish captured with standard recreational fishing gear and techniques in the southeast Florida recreational swordfish fishery. These data will also be used to analyze behavioral interactions with the fishing gear, such as habitat utilization patterns. By combining the PSAT data with data from temperature-depth recorders (TDRs), additional information on swordfish interactions, such as effective <b>fishing</b> <b>depths,</b> will be assessed. Data gathered by the PSATs and TDRs will also be compared with other descriptions of swordfish behavior. This study will be a collaborative effort with the local recreational swordfish fishery, utilizing local fishermen to conduct the field work.

40|$|Historical {{longline}} catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) constitutes the major time series used in tuna stock assessment {{to follow the}} trend in abundance {{since the beginning of}} the large-scale tuna fisheries. The efficiency and species composition of a longline fishing operations essentially depends on the overlap in the vertical and spatial distribution between hooks and species habitat. Longline catchability depends on the vertical distribution of hooks and the aim of our paper was to analyse principal factors affecting the deviation of observed longline hook depths from predicted values. Since observed hook depth is usually shallower than predicted, this deviation is called longline shoaling. We evaluate the accuracy of hook depth distribution estimated from a theoretical catenary model commonly used in longline CPUE standardizations. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on baskets of a monitored longline. Mainline shapes and maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>depths</b> were similar to gear configurations commonly used to target both yellowfin and bigeye tuna by commercial longliners in the central part of the South Pacific Ocean. Our working hypothesis assumes that the maximum fishing depth reached by the mainline depends on the gear configuration (sag ratio, mainline length per basket), the fishing tactics (bearing of the setting) and environmental variables characterizing water mass dynamics (wind stress, current velocity and shear). Based on generalized additive models (GAMs) simple transformations are proposed to account for the non-linearity between the shoaling and explanatory variables. Then, generalized linear models (GLMs) were fit to model the effects of explanatory variables on the longline shoaling. Results indicated that the shoaling (absolute as well as relative) was significantly influenced by (I) the shape of the mainline (i. e., the tangential angle), which is the strongest predictor, and (2) the current shear and the direction of setting. Geometric forcing (i. e. transverse versus in-line) between the environment and the longline set is shown for the first time from in situ experimental fishing data. Results suggest that a catenary model that does not take these factors into consideration provides a biased estimate of the vertical distribution of hooks and must be used with caution in CPUEs standardization methods. Since catchability varies in time and space we discuss how suitable data could be routinely collected onboard commercial fishing vessels in order to estimate longline catchability for stock assessments...|$|E
40|$|The {{red snapper}} Lutanus campechanus fishery is arguably {{one of the}} most {{important}} in the Gulf of Mexico, but habitat destruction, climate change, and serial overfishing has resulted in significant population declines in red snapper and other high-profile fisheries species. The red snapper fishery may be one of the best examples where management strategies that promote catch and release (CAR) have failed. Populations have not recovered despite CAR management strategies, likely because CAR mortality is high; however, the basis for CAR mortality is unclear. Numerous studies associated with fishing-induced mortality were reviewed in an attempt to make generalizations as to how red snapper and other high-profile fisheries species respond to CAR. A framework for understanding CAR mortality in red snapper and other species was constructed based on four pillars: retrieval conditions, species and size relationships, handling, and release conditions. Each of these fishing factors was examined as to relative impact toward CAR. A predictive model was generated from all available data on CAR mortality. For a deep-water fish like red snapper, the underlying problem is directly related to capture depth, particularly injuries related to rapid swim bladder (SB) overinflation and catastrophic decompression syndrome (CDS). If not immediately lethal, depth-related injuries may have long term effects on growth and immune function that could go unnoticed and are unaccounted for in traditional field studies; all other fishing factors will only intensify this baseline impairment. Management plans are typically built under the assumption that CAR mortality is below 20 %, but it is widely accepted that this is a gross underestimate. Modeling from this review suggests that, in red snapper, mortality may be as low as 20 % but only if fish are caught between 0 and 20 m depths. This is not the case, and CAR mortality may reach 100 % if fish are retrieved from deeper than 110 m. Current CAR management strategies are ineffective, and not enough information exists to impose maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>depths.</b> Given these limitations, a logical approach would be to restrict particular areas such that fish populations can be protected from all fishing and CAR activity, therefore protecting age, size, and sex classes and ratios. For fish species like red snapper, where overfishing is widespread and CAR mortality is high, or other species where CAR is unclear and a thorough investigation as to depth-related CAR mortality has not been performed, strategies based on space (i. e., marine protected areas and no-take reserves), rather than time or numbers (i. e., season closures, size limits, bag limits, etc.), have the greatest potential for overall conservation and sustainability and should be strongly considered...|$|E

40|$|Indices of {{abundance}} of blue shark (Prionace glauca) from the Venezuelan Pelagic Longline fishery are presented {{for the period}} 1994 - 2007. The index of number of fish per number of hooks (thousand) was estimated from numbers of blue shark caught and reported in the observer data forms recorded by scientific observers aboard longline (Venezuelan Pelagic Longline Observer Program) vessels since 1994. The standardization analysis procedure included the following variables; year, vessel, area, season, bait, and approximate <b>fishing</b> <b>depth.</b> The standardized index was estimated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models under a delta lognormal model approach. The standardized CPUE series show that the relative abundance of blue shark increased {{in the early part}} of the series (1994 - 98) followed by a decline from 1998 until 2006 with the lowest value in 2005, followed by a small recovery in the last year of the series...|$|R
