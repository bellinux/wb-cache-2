40|$|The setup {{shown in}} Figure 1 {{is used as}} a {{question}} for the student to check his or her understanding of how a pulley works. A pulley and a spring scale connected as indicated are mounted in a frame that in turn hangs from an upper spring scale. <b>The</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame and its contents is 5 N, as read from the upper spring scale. When <b>the</b> free end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled, until the lower spring scale reads 10 N, what will the upper spring scale read? (The answer is 10 N). The reason for this seemingly counterintuitive behavior lies in the way a pulley works. Although a force of only 5 N is exerted down by pulling <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> same tension <b>of</b> 5 N exists on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulley, so that <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring scale must feel a 10 -N downward force. However, <b>the</b> <b>fixed</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string is pulling up on the frame with the same 5 -N force, so the net downward force exerted on the upper scale by pulling <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is only 5 N...|$|R

40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of {{suspension and}} compensating ropes in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building coincides with the fundamental natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> large resonance whirling motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> result. This phenomenon leads to impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>the</b> elevator walls, making the building and elevator system unsafe. The impact loads affect <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elevator installation resulting in interruptions of service and damage to <b>the</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Furthermore, the car, counterweight and compensating sheave suffer from vertical vibrations due to the coupling with <b>the</b> lateral vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of a high-rise elevator system taking into account a scenario when the car is parked at the landing level corresponding to <b>the</b> resonance length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> <b>The</b> model is implemented in a high performance computational environment and <b>the</b> dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system when the building is subject to a low frequency sway, is determined through numerical simulation.

If we ask for an opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> tension in <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> man in the chest will say: [...] "The suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is neutralised by <b>the</b> tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> what determines <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is <b>the</b> gravitational mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspended body."
