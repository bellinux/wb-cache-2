5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a <b>feeding</b> <b>experiment</b> in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
50|$|Oribatid mites {{differ from}} other chelicerate {{animals such as}} spiders {{by the fact that}} they feed on food {{particles}} which they digest internally rather than fluid food digested externally. In a <b>feeding</b> <b>experiment,</b> specimens of Archegozetes longisetosus were offered algae Protococcus sp. scraped from tree bark, two fungi, Stachybotrys sp. and Alternaria sp., and some filter papers made of cellulose-rich wood fibres. They fed preferentially on the algae and also consumed the Alternaria but rejected the Stachybotrys and the filter papers. After about ten days they started to secrete chitinase but did not develop cellulase enzymes to break down cellulose under any of the experimental treatments.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2015 EASAC {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} potential effects on organisms providing a range of ecosystem services like pollination and natural pest control which are critical to sustainable agriculture. The resulting report concludes [...] "there is an increasing body of evidence that the widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids has severe negative effects on non-target organisms that provide ecosystem services including pollination and natural pest control." [...] Two studies published in Nature provided further evidence of the deleterious effect of neonicontinoids on bees, although the {{further research is needed to}} corroborate the findings: Oilseed rape seed coated with a combination of clothianidin and a pyrethroid [...] "reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions". In a <b>feeding</b> <b>experiment,</b> bees preferred sucrose solutions with imidacloprid or thiamethoxam, even though it [...] "caused them to eat less food overall".|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} plant {{palatability}} {{do not consider}} its seasonal variability, and infer general life-history patterns from single-date <b>feeding</b> <b>experiments.</b> This paper investigates whether different seasonal patterns in the palatability of perennial plant species in one community can alter their relative susceptibility to grazing. The palatability of eight freshwater macrophyte species growing at the same site was monitored during 1 year through nine consecutive <b>feeding</b> <b>experiments</b> using a generalist consumer, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Plant palatability varied significantly throughout the year, and reached its maximum in autumn. Beyond this general trend, seasonal patterns in palatability differed markedly between species, and two (Callitriche platycarpa and Nuphar lutea) showed no significant seasonal variations. Despite the interspecific differences in seasonal patterns of palatability, species' palatability rankings remained stable throughout the year. Therefore <b>feeding</b> <b>experiments</b> performed at a single sampling date are suitable to assess the relative palatability {{of a set of}} species.

The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).In locations where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate as}} the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
