In the present day, underwater robots have stretched the boundaries of what was previously thought impossible in terms of exploration, security and scientific discovery. These robots have become prevalent in a number of sectors and fields including the military, marine biology, oceanography and documentary production. As their applications become increasingly diverse, establishing precise control over the movement of these robots become more and more crucial. DC motors as force/torque generators for robots are well understood. We know exactly how much voltage must be applied to generate precise movement to achieve specifi c tasks. On the other hand, {{this is not the case}} for thrust generators for swimming robots due to the complexity of the dynamics of the combination of motor action with fluid/solid interactions. An <b>in-line</b> <b>pump</b> consists of a DC motor pumping fluid via a centrifugal pump through a tight space to generate thrust. Understanding of the dynamics of these interactions are vital if we are to establish accurate control over underwater robots. Through the mathematical modeling of ducted thrusters, computational analysis of fluid dynamics of ideal centrifugal pumps and a pendulum arm experimental setup, this research seeks to improve our understanding of the submersible <b>in-line</b> <b>pumps</b> as thrust generators for swimming robots...|$|R

40|$|Progressive cavity {{pumps are}} used in the transportion of slurries. The <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> {{consists}} of a single helical rotor, which intermeshes with a double helical resilient stator, to create the moving cavities that transport the slurry. Both components suffer from weaL at different rates, due to relative sliding movement of the rotor to the stator, and the presence of the abrasives carried within the slurry. for a pump manufacturer to remain active in the market they must provide the customer with optimised material selection, for both wearing parts, at a competitive price. Wear is not an intrinsic material property and its value is dependent upon the conditions within each individual tribological system. In order to improve or optimise the wear life of a system, it is first vital to understand the complexity of the mechanisms that generate the material loss. This thesis achieves this goal, with specific reference to a pumping system, by analysing the wear mechanisms of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> components in progressive cavity pumps and evaluating how the wear severity changes with the system parameters. The in-depth study has enabled a new wear model to be proposed which describes how the behaviour of the abrasive particles contribute to the wearing process, in the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> of a progressive cavity pump.

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{advancing}} the microchemical field from single device based demonstrations to systems that can perform multi-step series and parallel synthesis. Few examples of micro-separators and micro-pumps suited for miniaturized lab-on-a-chip systems for organic syntheses exist, {{so the first}} half of this thesis developed systems for these micro-unit-operations, while the second half demonstrated multistep microchemical operations enabled by these systems. In-line continuous separation devices are developed that enabled removal of unreacted reagents/byproducts, making it possible to realize a series of reactions without leaving the microreactor environment. Differences in surface forces and preferential wettability characteristics of fluoropolymers are used for phase separation. Such microseparators are used to demonstrate 100 % separation of two phase flows of hexane and water, toluene and water, dichloromethane and water, and hexane and methanol. Integrated liquid-liquid extraction devices are microfabricated that performed two -phase contacting by segmented flow, followed by separation - resulting in single stage extraction. Single stage extraction of N,N-dimethylformamide from dichloromethane to water, and from diethyl ether to water is demonstrated. The development of separators allows microreactors to be connected to microseparators to form microreactor networks enabling reactions and separations in succession. The starting reagents are loaded in syringes and syringe pumps push fluid through the train of microdevices. However, this pumping scheme is limited by pressure constraints at the pump drives as well as the microseparators. Therefore, there is a need to develop <b>in-line</b> <b>pumps</b> to sustain the microdevice network. Pressure-driven flow is employed for the operation of micropumps. An enclosure with the liquid is pressurized with helium gas, causing the liquid to flow. The dynamics of pressurizing and de-pressurizing an enclosure are modeled and confirmed by experiments. Active and passive control schemes to provide constant flowrate of the liquid are developed and implemented. Different schemes are developed to use the gas pressure to manipulate the flow path of liquids. (cont.) In one scheme, two enclosures are used together to perform as an <b>in-line</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>in-line</b> <b>pumps</b> also acted as a buffer to prevent any disturbance propagation, and allowed the upstream and downstream to operate at different flowrates. The pump concept is demonstrated at two scales - 1) microfabricated silicon chips of 40 microliter volume and 2) using glass shell vials of 10000 microliter volume. These pumps are used along with two microseparators to demonstrate two-stage countercurrent and cross-flow liquid-liquid extraction of N,Ndimethylformamide from dichloromethane to water starting with 4. 4 mole percent mixture. The <b>in-line</b> <b>pumps</b> also allowed recirculation with a constant flowrate that enabled long residence time reactions. As an example, peptide synthesis from amino acids, using the Merrifield technique is implemented. Specifically, the pentapeptide, Leuenkephalin is synthesized on different resins simultaneously as an example. A new design for the silicon microreactor for packed bed reactions is developed to enable larger catalyst loadings and offer manageable pressure drops across the packed bed even when the solid loading increased in volume during operation, as is the case with the peptide synthesis experiments. These microchips are also used to study "click chemistry" reactions to synthesize drug-candidate molecules. The packed bed microreactor experiments give higher conversions and better selectivities than batch experiments after the same amount of reaction time as the microreactor experiments provide increased relative catalyst concentration, and reduce side reactions that otherwise reduce selectivity. As an example of multi -step synthesis involving reactions and separations, the synthesis of carbamates starting from azoyl chloride and sodium azide, using the Curtius rearrangement of isocyanates is performed. This example also demonstrates parallel synthesis of analogous carbamates by introducing branching in the synthesis sequence after the isocyanate production to form microreactor networks. The second reaction involved heat decomposition of the organic azide, and performs faster when catalyzed using solid acid zeolite catalyst in a packed bed microreactor. (cont.) Continuous operation of the microdevice network for ~ 7 - 10 days at flowrates of 1 - 5 [mu]l/min show no change in performance. The microreactor based synthesis is run at higher temperatures than conventional batch scale reactions due to the inherent safety in microreactor based production. The multiple-carbamate-synthesis microreactor network consists of five microreactors and two separators. This demonstration is the first multi-step organic synthesis involving reactions and separations, and showcased the major contributions from this thesis. The development of micro-unit-operations in this thesis has advanced the microchemical field from single device based demonstrations to systems that can perform continuous-flow multi-step series and parallel chemical synthesis. by Hemantkumar Sahoo.

40|$|Improved efficiency, better {{controllability}} and {{low noise}} {{are the most}} demanding features form a displacement machine now-a-days. Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> controlled by valve plates or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and shear. As the valve will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element.</b> In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle.

Also energy storage and recovery can be possible by using accumulator...|$|R

This paper presents an experimental study on the effect of a nonuniform suction velocity profile on performance of a mixed-flow pump and hydrodynamic forces on the impeller. In the experiments, a newly designed dynamometer is used, equipped with six full Wheatstone bridges of strain gauges to measure the six generalized force components. It is placed in between the shaft of the pump and the impeller and corotates with the rotor system. A high accuracy is obtained due to the orthogonality of bridge positioning and the signal conditioning electronics embedded within the dynamometer. The suction flow distribution to the pump is adapted using a pipe bundle situated in the suction pipe.

Ever increasing demand on better control systems of underwater robots ignites engineers on modeling the systems for perfection.

The need for maneuvering precision, for small and fast dynamic positioning, for precise motion and position control and for station keeping made developments of thruster modeling inevitable.
