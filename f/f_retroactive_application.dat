40|$|In 2013, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was {{the first}} Circuit Court to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The Fair Sentencing Act sought to end the discriminatory effects of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and its {{treatment}} of one gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent to one hundred grams of powder cocaine. The Fair Sentencing Act was meant to remedy the injustices {{brought about by the}} infamous 100 : 1 ratio in crack-cocaine and powder cocaine minimum sentencing. Despite this purpose, the Fair Sentencing Act does not contain language that explicitly and unequivocally requires that the new mandatory minimums be applied retroactively. Thus, a narrow reading of the Fair Sentencing Act would mean that individuals sentenced under mandatory minimums that the law acknowledged were, at the very least, perpetuating a racially discriminatory system, would have to serve out those sentences. The Sixth Circuit in Blewett v. United States held that a reading of the Fair Sentencing Act that did not allow for <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> of the more lenient and less dubious mandatory minimums created equal protection concerns that mandated reading the text to allow for <b>retroactive</b> <b>application.</b> Although the original Blewett panel decision has been heavily criticized, vacated, and eventually overturned en banc, this Comment argues that the original Blewett panel was correct in holding that equal protection requires reading the text of the Fair Sentencing Act to allow for <b>retroactive</b> <b>application...</b>|$|R

40|$|Three {{recently}} decided cases {{discuss the}} <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to pre- 1952 claims—Carl Marks 2 ̆ 6 Co. v. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Jackson v. People 2 ̆ 7 s Republic of China, and Slade v. United States of Mexico. These cases have conclusively {{established that the}} FSIA {{is not to be}} applied retroactively to pre- 1952 events—i. e., to claims arising prior to the issuance of the Tate Letter. They do not resolve the issue of <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> of the FSIA to post- 1952 events, however, and this issue is currently engulfed in confusion. This Comment attempts to resolve this confusion and propose a solution to the retroactivity problem. Section II delineates the retroactivity issue, while Section III discusses the history of sovereign immunity and describes the FSIA in detail. Section IV outlines the sources of confusion in the area of FSIA retroactivity and identifies four basic principles which may be applied to circumvent the confusion. Finally, Section V proposes a retroactivity solution arrived at through the application of these principles...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{argues that}} similar {{legislation}} would be desirable in Washington. Even though the proposed statute would entail a substantial {{deviation from the}} common-law rule, the resulting benefits justify the change. This Comment also examines the <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> of variation of trusts statutes and concludes that a <b>retroactive</b> <b>application</b> is constitutional. A requirement that courts consent {{on behalf of the}} beneficiaries only when the variation benefits the beneficiaries in some manners sufficiently protects the beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 constitutional interests under the contract clause 10 and the due process clause of the federal Constitution. Finally, this Comment proposes that a Washington variation of trusts statute include: (1) a provision directing the court to consider the settlor 2 ̆ 7 s intentions before approving a requested variation, to maintain the stability of trusts validly created under Washington law; (2) a provision for separate representation for minor, disabled, unborn, or unascertained beneficiaries, to ensure that their interests are accurately represented to the court; and (3) a provision directing costs to be charged to adult beneficiaries when a variation is denied, to discourage frivolous trust litigation...|$|R
