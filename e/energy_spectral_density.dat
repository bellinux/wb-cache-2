5000|$|When {{the energy}} of the signal is {{concentrated}} around a finite time interval, especially if its total energy is finite, one may compute the <b>energy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density.</b> More commonly used is the power spectral density (or simply power spectrum), which applies to signals existing over all time, or over a time period large enough (especially in relation to the duration of a measurement) that it could as well have been over an infinite time interval. The power spectral density (PSD) then refers to the spectral energy distribution that would be found per unit time, since the total energy of such a signal over all time would generally be infinite. Summation or integration of the spectral components yields the total power (for a physical process) or variance (in a statistical process), identical to what would be obtained by integrating [...] over the time domain, as dictated by Parseval's theorem.|$|E

Here, power can be the actual physical power, or more often, for convenience with abstract signals, is simply identified with the squared value of the signal. For example, statisticians study the variance of a function over time [...] (or over another independent variable), and using an analogy with electrical signals (among other physical processes), it is customary to {{refer to it as}} the power spectrum even when there is no physical power involved.

40|$|Monitoring seismic {{activity}} in mines, produced by high stress faults {{in the vicinity}} of mining operations, is an important issue for mine planning. A seismic event produces a short–time duration acoustic pressure wave that travels through the rock. This low-energy {{seismic activity}} in mines is typically referred to as microseismic events. The location of a microseismic event is very important for mine planning since these events indicate unstable areas. Their location can be estimated using the pressure wave signals recorded at a set of sensors distributed throughout the mine. One method of localization searches over a grid of hypothesized source locations to find the one that best explains the observered measurements. The expression for the variance of error of this method depends upon the <b>energy</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> of the sensor signal.
