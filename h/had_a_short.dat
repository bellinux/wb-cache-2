5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb). As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered.

Nemegtomaia is classified {{as a member of the}} oviraptorid subfamily Ingeniinae, and it the only known member of this group with a cranial crest.
