5000|$|The thyroid is {{normally}} very resistant to infection.

Despite all this, a persistent fistula from the piriform sinus may make the left lobe of the thyroid susceptible to infection and abscess formation.

Therapeutically, lasalocid eliminated established overt infections of the intestine, although infection persisted {{in the common}} bile duct and intestinal infection recurred after lasalocid treatment was stopped.
