He further noted, [...] "There were so many striking visual images both on stage and on screen, the show felt like a Pinterest board come to life -- packed with bold colors and graphics, elegant modern dance positions and video clips." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger also compared the light-up platforms on the stage with the towering cubes used during the Watch the Throne Tour. In another review, he noted, [...] "The light show was as hypnotic as Laser Floyd, the costumes glittered like mirror balls, and the bass at Ovation Hall was so booming that I often felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a stiff wind." [...] Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote, ...|$|E
2500|$|She gave up {{her music}} career after an {{incident}} that occurred on a German television show. [...] "The host said to me, 'Tracey Ullman. Hello!' I said, 'Hello' and he went, 'Guffaw, guffaw. Crazy as ever!' Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the background and he slung a rat over my shoulder. I thought, 'That's it, I don't {{want to do this}} anymore.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{pulled back}} to where the vessel had sunk and on our way picked up six men who were {{swimming}} – two of whom were drunk and gave us much trouble all the time. The six men we picked up were hauled into the boat by the women. Two of these men died in the boat. The boat we were in started to take in water; I do not know how. We had to bail. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in our boat, so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru {{had visited}} Kadiri town in 1964. Communist Party {{was very strong}} in Kadiri area under the {{leadership}} of Nizam Vali. The number of Communist workers and sympathizers carrying Red Flags that converged at the venue of the meeting was so high that it prompted Nehru to exclaim “I feel as if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the streets of Moscow.” ...|$|R

60|$|The {{curtains}} {{of his bed}} <b>were</b> drawn aside, <b>I</b> tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The {{curtains of}} his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself {{face to face with}} the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now to you, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the spirit at your elbow.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream {{and it was as if}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E

In his {{introduction}} to With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969 he writes: [...] "A {{few months after the}} death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world." [...] "I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I {{had no idea what was}} about to happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 November 1971, {{when the}} natural climate {{was dry and}} more {{adaptable}} and by which time the Bangladesh Forces had severely weakened {{the strength of the}} West Pakistan Forces through its guerilla operations, under a complicated politico-military scenario.

The Pakistani force were demoralized from constant attacks by the Mukti Bahini, on 16 December 1971 the Pakistani Military force in Bangladesh surrender to a joint force of Indian and Bangladesh forces. Group Captain A. K. Khandker represented the Bangladeshi side at the signing of the surrender treaty. K M Shafiullah, S Force commander, and a handful of others were also among the hundreds of local masses who surrounded the event from a distance. [...] "No protocol was set on what they were supposed to do". A fact Shafiullah admitted himself. [...] "We rushed to the Race Course from the airport. I was a member of Bangladesh delegation. But we were not sure what we were supposed to do. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of the signing table. That's why I do not appear in any photographs. There was rejoicing all around. We put Niazi on a jeep and sent him away. That night I did not come across anyone." [...] -Major General Shafiullah spoke to Kaushik Sankar Das.|$|E
6000|$|Whilst {{these things}} had been going forward, Mr. Langely and <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> silence, but now my first mate turned to me, [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "methinks that they mean to attack us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should {{sleep the}} worse,' {{answered}} Nicholas, impatiently. 'Sleep! Exhausted as <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> no common need of rest, I cannot hope to {{close my eyes}} all night, unless you tell me everything.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, Master Robert," [...] gasped Edwards, {{sitting down}} and panting vehemently, after having {{extinguished}} the flames, [...] "wot have you been a-doin' of?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> speechless <b>in</b> the midst of my upset chair, table, and books, glaring wildly, when the man said this.|$|R
60|$|Within sixty seconds <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> erect <b>in</b> {{the rear}} of the {{building}} which Master Lord counted to be our prison, free to go whithersoever I would, so that I kept myself clear from the patrol and did not blunder upon too many Tories.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 he {{received}} the Reebok Human Rights Award in Boston and in his acceptance speech he said: [...] "I am one of those millions {{of children who are}} suffering in Pakistan through bonded labour and child labour, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> lucky that due to the efforts of Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF), I go out <b>in</b> freedom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of you here today.

60|$|But one day I fancied I had {{got hold}} of a clue. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> our lower front hall, when I saw young McPherson, whom I used to know in New York, coming up the doorsteps.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> silence {{thinking}} {{over this}} sinister invitation of my uncle's, when I heard my own name, and, looking up, I saw de Caulaincourt, with his brown handsome face and tall elegant figure, {{making his way}} towards me.|$|E
60|$|Now indeed I {{knew where}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing.</b> <b>In</b> all broad Scotland there was {{but the one}} name proscribed, {{and that was the}} name of the Macgregors. Yet so far from fleeing this {{undesirable}} acquaintancy, I plunged the deeper in.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that was}} not the end of it. In the mysterious {{providence}} of the all-wise gods it was otherwise ordained.

5000|$|In {{a speech}} in November 2012 at Tufts University, he tackled a {{recurrent}} theme in his life — {{his status as a}} multi-racial man: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of you a black, white, Ojibwe, Afro-Boricua, HIV-positive queer man, he said. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just as black as any of you… No more high yellow and midnight blue conversations when talking about skin unless it’s to talk about how that high yellow or midnight blue person rocked your socks last night after that party and you are about to take his or her last name.

6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have been a tailor. Tailors, <b>I</b> think, <b>are</b> {{generally}} the most ill-conditioned, sceptical, and patriotic of men. Had my natural propensities been sharpened by the difficulty of maintaining a wife and children upon seven and sixpence a day, I really think I could have done something to make myself conspicuous. As it <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> neither one thing nor another; neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring. To the mind devoted to marquises I can understand that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> a revolting being. I have no aptitudes for aristocratic prettinesses. Her ladyship has three sons, either of which would make a perfect marquis. How is it possible that she should not think that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> her way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dreamed of}} a place very like this," [...] she said, nodding her head. [...] "I thought that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> such a spot in a fearful gale, and that the sea got under the {{foundations}} and washed the dead out of their graves." ...|$|E

"Only a bare half-hour before I saw you battling {{with the}} plant men <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the {{moonlight}} upon {{the banks of}} a broad river that taps {{the eastern shore of}} Earth's most blessed land.

6000|$|That was the 15th of August, 1896. Three days later, when my {{wife and}} Clara were about half-way across the ocean, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> our dining-room {{thinking}} of nothing in particular, when a cablegram was put into my hand. It said, [...] "Susy was peacefully released to-day." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leela {{got married}} to a lawyer, but the {{marriage}} was not successful. In her later years, Leela was busy rendering classical concerts and light music programs. Leela was staying with her sister's children in Defence colony, St. Thomas Mount (Parangimalai). Her world consisted of her music, her pooja room and memories of her father. V.K.Menon was {{the man behind the}} singer Leela. In many of the interviews Leela emotionally recalled [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> front of you and talking, it is because of my father; he was everything to me. The fame, wealth was all given to me by him. Without him, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not what <b>I</b> am." [...] Leela fulfilled her father's dreams, enthralling her fans with her mellifluous voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I extorted the confession. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> justified, <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a mother's position, as I do.

5000|$|Katie Roiphe, in her 1993 book The Morning After, {{questioned}} whether {{one in four}} women are victims of rape, writing [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> really <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of an}} epidemic, a crisis, if 25 percent of my female friends were being raped, wouldn't I know it?" ...|$|R

"It {{would be}} about twal o'clock," [...] began Wearyworld unctuously, [...] "when I was in the Roods, ay, no lang afore I heard the {{disturbance}} in the square. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the middle o' the road, wondering how the door o' the windmill was swinging open, when she came up to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dreamt that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing,</b> <b>in</b> {{my wedding}} dress, before {{the altar of}} a strange church; and that a clergyman whose voice I had never heard before, was marrying me----" [...] She stopped, impatiently waving her hand before her in the air. [...] "Blind as I am," [...] she said, [...] "I see him again now!" ...|$|E
60|$|But a horse!

Georgie {{is by no means}} an {{exemplary}} character, but it so happens that his old man in recent years develops to a new high the art of separating well-to-do citizens from their potatoes and as a result does not worry much these days concerning the necessities of life. Since Georgie is an only child, Roberts the elder is more than liberal with such material things as automobiles and potatoes, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> broadminded enough to overlook certain minor defects in Georgie 2 ̆ 7 s character in order to assist him in distributing said potatoes in the most judicious manner possible...|$|R
