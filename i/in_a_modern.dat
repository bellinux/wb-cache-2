5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished.

Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E

5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern,</b> industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{stations}} Charles Holden {{designed for the}} extension, Arnos Grove was built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> European style using brick, {{glass and reinforced concrete}} and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line.|$|E

Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's reception.

The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>modern</b> idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.|$|E
