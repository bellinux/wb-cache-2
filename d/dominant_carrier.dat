2500|$|China Everbright Group, the Henan Working Group and AirAsia Berhad have {{announced}} {{the signing of}} a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a low-cost carrier in China as a joint venture. AirAsia China will be based in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, where the new low-cost carrier also {{plans to build a}} dedicated low-cost carrier terminal, an aviation training academy and a MRO facility. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes said, “We chose Zhengzhou as our base due to its strategic location and importance as a logistics hub. As China’s gateway to Europe, Zhengzhou sits at the centre of a vast rail, highway and air transport network that forms the linchpin of China’s development plans for its central and western regions. With President Xi Jinping’s vision for One Belt, One Road, Zhengzhou is set to become even more important, not least as the heart of low-cost air travel in North Asia." [...] China Everbright Group is a conglomerate focused on financial services and controlled by the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. Henan Working Group represents the Henan state government. AirAsia already operates joint ventures in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand and is about to relaunch its activities in Japan. It also has recently announced plans for a JV in Vietnam. AirAsia Group already serves 15 destinations in China, but does not yet operate from/to Zhengzhou, where China Southern Airlines is the <b>dominant</b> <b>carrier</b> today controlling approximately 23% of weekly capacity according to the ch-aviation capacity module.|$|E

30|$|It is {{customary}} {{to mention}} that a change in slope of Sphdrag is obtained at about T ≈ θ D, as in the normal metals [9]. Indeed, below T ≈ θ D, the temperature dependence of the phonon-drag contribution is attributed to be a competitive process in which S(T) decreases on lowering temperature and slightly improves on increasing temperature which is attributed to phonon-phonon scattering. To an extent, {{a comparison of the}} computed data, a consistent fit with the reported data, was obtained by choosing a reasonable set of parameters. It is instructive to compare the observation with that of conventional superconductors where the thermally excited quasiparticles of the electron system are <b>dominant</b> <b>carriers</b> of heat; a similar situation is revealed in Rb 3 C 60.|$|R

5000|$|Precipitation {{hardening}} {{relies on}} changes in solid solubility with temperature to produce fine particles of an impurity phase, which impede the movement of dislocations, or defects in a crystal's lattice. Since dislocations are often the <b>dominant</b> <b>carriers</b> of plasticity, this serves to harden the material. The impurities play the same role as the particle substances in particle-reinforced composite materials. Just as the formation of ice in air can produce clouds, snow, or hail, depending upon the thermal history of a given portion of the atmosphere, precipitation in solids can produce many different sizes of particles, which have radically different properties. Unlike ordinary tempering, alloys must be kept at elevated temperature for hours to allow precipitation to take place. This time delay is called [...] "aging". Solution treatment and aging is sometimes abbreviated [...] "STA" [...] in metals specs and certs.|$|R

40|$|In {{one-dimensional}} {{electronic systems}} with strong repulsive interactions, charge excitations propagate {{much faster than}} spin excitations. Such systems therefore have an intermediate temperature range [termed the "spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid" (SILL) regime] where charge excitations are "cold" (i. e., have low entropy) whereas spin excitations are "hot. " We explore the effects of charge-sector disorder in the SILL regime {{in the absence of}} external sources of equilibration. We argue that the disorder localizes all charge-sector excitations; however, spin excitations are protected against full localization, and act as a heat bath facilitating charge and energy transport on asymptotically long time scales. The charge, spin, and energy conductivities are widely separated from one another. The <b>dominant</b> <b>carriers</b> of energy in much of the SILL regime are neither charge nor spin excitations, but neutral "phonon" modes, which undergo an unconventional form of hopping transport that we discuss. We comment on the applicability of these ideas to experiments and numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the factors that have allowed <b>dominant</b> <b>carriers</b> to maintain their monopolies in spite of regulatory efforts to introduce competition. The paper focuses exclusively on interconnection because it is the element that allows non-dominant companies to enter a market. Two existing theoretical frameworks and two others developed in this research explain the factors that have limited the ability of regulators to achieve their competition goal: (1) asymmetric information, (2) capture theory, (3) minimum compliance and (4) legal play. After explaining the theory, the paper presents the Mexican case, the environment of liberalization arising from the 1995 federal telecommunications law, as well as regulations and court rulings that resulted from the disputes among carriers. Comparisons are drawn with the historical U. S. regulation of interconnection. The proposed theory combined with existing theories appears to provide a good, but still imperfect explanation of why the incumbent carrier in Mexico maintains its monopoly status in spite of effort...|$|R
