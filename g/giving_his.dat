5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy.

5|$|Following Samuel Aba's death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and {{restored}} Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, {{which suggests that}} Hungary became an imperial fief.

Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul's exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter's second rule in 1046.|$|E
