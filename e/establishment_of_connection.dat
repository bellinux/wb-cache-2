40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} {{a possibility of}} application protocol implementation in OPNET Modeler simulation environment. It presumes that this application protocol is going to use TCP protocol for their communication on transport layer. The first part of thesis is focused on a description of TCP. It is a connection oriented, reliable and confirmed protocol which maintains sequence of transmitted data. This data is after receiving positively confirmed. In the second chapter are described the main functions of OPNET Modeler simulation environment. OPNET is hierarchical divided into four editors. Each editor has a specific function by creating a network and setting his behavior. There is also focused on the two lowest layers of OPNET Modeler and their components in detail, which are participating at usage TCP on transport layer to communication. Implemented applications communicate by sockets, which are created and destroyed on request. Communication is controlled by manager process, whose function is maintenance particular connections and redirect dataflow into relevant process. This manager put in action as well a process, which simulates a single TCP. In the practical part I made two applications: one is a client type and a second one is a server type. Both applications are using TCP on transport layer. The <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> initiates a client, who is sending a request to the server for a data. Then server sends back data in desired quantity. After sending the entire data, client terminates the connection. The result of simulation is statistics, where we pictured {{the size of the}} transferred data, a number of transferred packets and other parameters typical for TCP...|$|E
40|$|Background: Most of {{detected}} {{changes in}} the shoulder rotator cuff are the consequence of chronic changes. Fresh injuries of individual parts of the rotator cuff have to be proved without a doubt {{as soon as possible}} after the injury. The basic question with regard to any expert appraisal of {{changes in the}} shoulder rotator cuff is undoubtedly the determination of post-injury changes as well as the distinction between degenerative changes, changes discovered by chance and fresh injuries of the rotator cuff. A detailed analysis of the clinical picture, the biomechanics of the event and early application of specific imaging diagnostic methods enable certain determination of causal connections between the actual event and the established changes in rotator cuff. Conclusions: A systematic approach to analysis of all data about the condition of the shoulder prior to the injury, certain <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> between the injury event, the first medical surgical, histological and ultrasound results, CT and magnetic resonance, along with the analyses of accompanying changes, enable an expert to give a decisive medical expert appraisal. The latest findings about the biomechanics of rotator cuff injuries which contain an analysis of load on individual parts of the rotator cuff in certain arm positions as well as the knowledge about the progress and causes of the circulation changes in parts of rotator cuff and the role of microtrauma provide for the distinction between the manifestation of silent changes which have been undergoing for a longer time and undoubtedly established fresh injuries of the healthy parts of the rotator cuff. The article presents the phase analysis of established changes in the rotator cuff, including the findings and instructions for providing an expert appraisal of the shoulder rotator cuff following an injury. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold. First, to examine the {{outcomes}} and implications of being in an informal mentoring relationship at various junctures of the novice music educator’s teaching career. Second, to investigate the usefulness of Social Exchange Theory (SET) as a lens to examine these relationships and mentoring practices. Research questions addressed the nature of informal mentoring relationships in a music education setting, factors prompting these relationships to continue, and the nature of mentoring interactions based on SET concepts. Three novice general music teachers, varying from one to four years in teaching experience, with their informal music teacher mentors provided details about their mentoring experiences in this multiple case study. A total of 21 interviews took place over the course of one school year, ranging from individual interviews, paired mentor-mentee interviews, small novice teacher and mentor focus group interviews, and a large focus group interview. Using interviews and group discussions as data, the nature and value of informal mentoring relationships were analyzed in relation to main concepts found in SET. Deductive codes based on SET were used to identify patterns and subsequent themes. These themes and other findings were described qualitatively and illustrated by direct quotations from participant responses. Findings indicate that effective mentoring was able to occur because of the following factors: (a) the element of choice in selecting a mentoring partner, (b) the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> based on similar backgrounds and teaching philosophies which facilitated value and trust, (c) the establishment of a reciprocating relationship, and (d) the quality of mentors and mentoring practices. The SET concepts of rewards, costs, and exchange rules were also found to be useful in the analysis of these mentoring relationships. In this study, there were not only implications for the novice music teacher participants but for their mentors as well. The novice teacher participants were able to “give back” to their mentors by means of new ideas, resources, friendship, and support. These prolonged mentorships cultivated support systems for the novice and the experienced music educator needed to thrive in the music education profession...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Indian River-linking Project {{is based}} on the Indian National Perspective Plan for the diversion of huge amount of waters from the major internationally shared rivers, which includes among others the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers. There are two components of the project. Its first component aims to link 14 Himalayan rivers in Northern India and the second component would connect 16 peninsular rivers in Southern India. The first component involves the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> with the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which is of special interest to Bangladesh. India seeks to complete this ambitious project by 2016. The Supreme Court of India, in response to a writ petition has directed the government of India to complete the construction of the river linking project by 2012. This proposed scheme for interlinking rivers in India has become a grave cause of concern in Bangladesh and created new tensions with India. Bangladesh expressed its concerns over the potential impact of India’s project on interlinking of trans-boundary rivers on the economy and environment of Bangladesh. Water diversions by India are likely to have a serious impact on Bangladesh's access to and use of fresh water as a lower riparian country. The outcome of the project {{has the potential to be}} an unprecedented man made disaster for natural ecosystems and human health in Bangladesh. Many including the civil societies in both India and Bangladesh are now apprehensive of its viability and detrimental effects. The controversy surrounding the project is steadily outgrowing the national arena of Bangladesh and India and making the project an international concern. This paper examines the impact of this project on downstream ecology and economy of Bangladesh. It analyses the relevant international law, international environmental law and policies in determining the rights and obligations of the riparian states in sharing and utilising their common water of international rivers. It outlines the responsibility and liability of riparian states, such as India, for their action in diverting the waters of international rivers causing serious detriment to the use and rightful share of co-riparian states, such as Bangladesh. 1 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{program of}} a {{differentiated}} somatic cell {{can be altered}} by nuclear transplantation, cell fusion or co-culture. This work demonstrates that somatic gene function can be manipulated in vitro. We developed two novel strategies by which reprogramming of gene expression in a differentiated somatic cell can take place. Our first approach relies on the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> through gap junctions between somatic cells and blastomeres. We show that mouse epithelial cells are capable of forming gap junctions with blastomeres following injection into cleavage stage mouse embryos. In contrast, fibroblasts adhere but do not form gap junctions with blastomeres. Adhesion of the somatic cells to blastomeres was assessed by electron microscopy and immunological procedures using cell adhesion markers. Transfer of a fluorescent soluble dye from somatic cells to the adherent blastomeres demonstrated formation of functional gap junctions. <b>Establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between epithelial cells and blastomeres correlated with induction of expression of the embryonic and ES cell-specific transcription factor, Oct- 4, in the epithelial cells. We argue that communication between epithelial cells and blastomeres results in changes in somatic cell gene expression. Our second approach relies on the production of cell extracts to which permeabilized fibroblasts are exposed. The resulting fibroblasts are reprogrammed and thus take on characteristics and functions typical of the cell type from which the extract was derived, including the induction of Oct- 4. The development of these reprogramming systems {{can be used to}} define the factors necessary for reprogramming somatic cells. Ultimately, these strategies for altering genome function could be applied to develop cell therapeutics. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{construction}} of spinal sensory-motor circuits involves {{the selection of}} appropriate synaptic partners and the allocation of precise synaptic input densities. Many aspects of spinal sensory-motor selectivity appear to be preserved when peripheral sensory activation is blocked, {{which has led to}} a view that sensory-motor circuits are assembled in an activity-independent manner. Yet it remains unclear whether activity-dependent refinement has a role in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>connections</b> between sensory afferents and those motor pools that have synergistic biomechanical functions. We show here that genetically abolishing central sensory-motor neurotransmission leads to a selective enhancement in the number and density <b>of</b> such “heteronymous” <b>connections,</b> whereas other aspects of sensory-motor connectivity are preserved. Spike-timing-dependent synaptic refinement represents one possible mechanism for the changes in connectivity observed after activity blockade. Our findings therefore reveal that sensory activity does have a limited and selective role in the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> patterned monosynaptic sensory-motor connections...|$|R

We investigate the algorithmic tractability <b>of</b> multi-connection <b>establishment</b> problems, both in online and offline frameworks.

These heuristics are designed based on the insight gained from our study. Through simulations, we indicate the advantages of these heuristics over more straightforward alternatives. We extend our study to K connections, for a fixed K that is larger than 2.
