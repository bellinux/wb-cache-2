40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} Coefficient of Performance (COP) augmentation of an air conditioning system utilizing an <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>condenser.</b> The experimental facility consisted of four major components: compressor, evaporator, thermal expansion valve, and <b>condenser.</b> An <b>evaporative</b> cooling unit was located upstream from the condenser. Thermal parameters, such as relative humidity, dry bulb temperature, and wet bulb temperature were measured to evaluate the effect of in-direct evaporative cooling on the system COP. The results indicated an inverse relation between the condenser inlet dry bulb temperature and the COP. The changes in specific enthalpy of the air across the <b>evaporative</b> cooled <b>condenser</b> were due to latent heat transfer and sensible heat exchanges, whereas the specific enthalpy changes for the conventional condenser were primarily caused by sensible heat exchanges. By using the <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>condenser</b> to pre-cool the air, the saturation temperature drop through the condenser increased from 2. 4 °C to 6. 6 °C. It also resulted in an increase of the mass flow rate of refrigerant into the evaporator; this mass increase of liquid entering the evaporator consequently resulted in the increase of COP from 6. 1 % to 18 %. A power reduction up to 14. 3 % on the compressor was also achieved. Under partial load conditions, the DEC system showed a 20 % less COP reduction compared to the conventional system. The result revealed the relation between water consumption and compressor energy saving. Although greater power reductions were fulfilled at higher dry bulb temperatures, the optimal applicable temperature was around 33. 1 °C. ...|$|R

In this model, the kinetics-based Schrage equation is used {{to account for the}} <b>evaporative</b> and <b>condensing</b> interfacial mass flows. Laminar and turbulent approaches to modeling natural convection in the tank and heat and mass transfer at the interface are compared. The flow, temperature, and interfacial mass fluxes predicted by these two approaches during tank self-pressurization are compared against each other. The ullage pressure and vapor temperature evolutions are also compared against experimental data obtained from the MHTB (Multipuprpose Hydrogen Test Bed) self-pressurization experiment. A CFD model for cooling cryogenic storage tanks by spraying cold liquid in the ullage is also presented. The Euler- Lagrange approach is utilized for tracking the spray droplets and for modeling interaction between the droplets and the continuous phase (ullage). The spray model is coupled with the VOF (volume of fluid) model by performing particle tracking in the ullage, removing particles from the ullage when they reach the interface, and then adding their contributions to the liquid. Droplet ullage heat and mass transfer are modeled. The flow, temperature, and interfacial mass flux predicted by the model are presented. The ullage pressure is compared with experimental data obtained from the MHTB spray bar mixing experiment.

40|$|Micro {{heat pipes}} {{have been used}} to cool micro {{electronic}} devices, but their heat transfer coefficients are low compared with those of conventional heat pipes. In this work, a dual-wet pipe is proposed as a model to study heat transfer in micro heat pipes. The dual-wet pipe has a long and narrow cavity of rectangular cross-section. The bottom-half of the horizontal pipe is made of a wetting material, and the top-half of a non-wetting material. A wetting liquid fills {{the bottom half of the}} cavity, while its vapour fills the rest. This configuration ensures that the liquid–vapour interface is pinned at the contact line. As one end of the pipe is heated, the liquid evaporates and increases the vapour pressure. The higher pressure drives the vapour to the cold end where the vapour condenses and releases the latent heat. The condensate moves along the bottom half of the pipe back to the hot end to complete the cycle. We solve the steady-flow problem assuming a small imposed temperature difference between the two ends of the pipe. This leads to skew-symmetric fluid flow and temperature distribution along the pipe so that we only need to focus on the evaporative half of the pipe. Since the pipe is slender, the axial flow gradients are much smaller than the cross-stream gradients. Thus, we can treat the evaporative flow in a cross-sectional plane as two-dimensional. This evaporative motion is governed by two dimensionless parameters: an evaporation number E defined as the ratio of the evaporative heat flux at the interface to the conductive heat flux in the liquid, and a Marangoni number M. The motion is solved in the limit E→∞ and M→∞. It is found that evaporation occurs mainly near the contact line in a small region of size E− 1 W, where W is the half-width of the pipe. The non-dimensional evaporation rate Q* ~ E− 1 ln E as determined by matched asymptotic expansions. We use this result to derive analytical solutions for the temperature distribution Tp and vapour and liquid flows along the pipe. The solutions depend on three dimensionless parameters: the heat-pipe number H, which is the ratio of heat transfer by vapour flow to that by conduction in the pipe wall and liquid, the ratio R of viscous resistance of vapour flow to interfacial evaporation resistance, and the aspect ratio S. If HRxs 226 B 1, a thermal boundary layer appears near the pipe end, the width of which scales as (HR) − 1 / 2 L, where L is the half-length of the pipe. A similar boundary layer exists at the cold end. Outside the boundary layers, Tp varies linearly with a gradual slope. Thus, these regions correspond to the <b>evaporative,</b> adiabatic and <b>condensing</b> regions commonly observed in conventional heat pipes. This is the first time that the distinct regions have been captured by a single solution, without prior assumptions of their existence. If HR ~ 1 or less, then Tp is linear almost everywhere. This is the case found in most micro-heat-pipe experiments. Our analysis of the dual-wet pipe provides an explanation for the comparatively low effective thermal conductivity in micro heat pipes, and points to ways of improving their heat transfer capabilities...|$|R

40|$|The overall thermal {{efficiency}} of power producing and power consuming processes increases if they operate at lower condensing temperatures. The {{purpose of this}} work {{is to show that}} reduced condensing temperatures can be achieved by augmentation of external heat transfer. Substantial improvement is obtained when the outside heat transfer surfaces are continuously wetted by recirculated water of which only a smal quantity evaporates and needs to be replenished. Such heat exchangers known as evaporatively cooled condensers use air and water simultaneously. ^ Problems associated with the <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser</b> theory exist because the heat and mass transfer processes within the system are not of the closed type. Differential equations which describe the process cannot be solved, since the number of unknown parameters is larger than the number of available equations. The lack of acceptable theory is compensated by the collection of experimental data and by fitting them in some empirical form. ^ This work is directed in an entirely different way than similar reported work in literature. The study provides analytical solutions to the problem by recognizing that the heat transfer performance and the change of state of air and water along their paths in the heat exchanger can be evaluated in a step-by-step procedure. This was first performed {{with the aid of a}} Mollier i-x diagram and later simulated by an extensive computer program. A platefin tube type condenser and bare tube type condenser models were investigated. The heat and mass transfer processes in an <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser</b> were solved by computerized graphical methods using the i-x diagram which obeys all conservation laws. ^ Analytical results were compared with measured experimental data from a bench type apparatus. An in-line bare tube test section has been tested and its performance was compared with the predicted performance. Results are very close. Deviation of measured from predicted data are of the order of only a few percent. ^ Results of this investigation show undoubtedly the benefit of the evaporative cooling method for augmentation of heat transfer in a condenser. Reduced condensing temperatures are commonly close to ambient temperature or even below it. Savings of energy consumption range from 10 percent for power plants to 50 percent for refrigeration systems.

40|$|Refrigeration {{systems on}} {{industrial}} {{plants such as}} dairy processing facilities are major consumers of energy. The higher the efficiency of these systems the {{lower the cost of}} electricity and subsequent carbon emissions from electricity produced from fossil fuels. Traditionally chemical treatment of cooling loops for refrigeration systems has been undertaken in a reactive manner. The treatment regime is only changed when there is a detrimental effect on the system such as the development of corrosion, scale or biofilm. Often this results in medium to long term losses in efficiency before the situation is rectified. A predictive model has been developed that has the potential to allow real time control of chemical treatment for cooling loops. The model predicts the film thickness for common fouling materials found in cooling systems and the heat transfer efficiency losses associated with this fouling. Such a predictive model can be used in conjunction with monitoring of the apparent heat transfer efficiency to infer the film thickness and therefore guide chemical treatment programmes. The model was tested against foulant efficiency relationships published by Qureshi and Zubair, Macleod - Smith and The Carrier Refrigeration Handbook. In all three cases the predictive model produced results that agreed with the results for each of these sources. The model was also tested using the reticulated ammonia refrigeration system at Fonterra Whareroa. Psychrometric, climatic, data logged temperatures and sensor data from the Whareroa system database were used to calculate the efficiency of one of the refrigeration system’s condensers (EC 1). Resulting heat of rejection values and an estimated thermal conduction constant (k) based on a deposit analysis were used as inputs for the model to calculate the predicted foulant film thickness. Inspection of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser</b> during the June 2010 shut determined the model had predicted the foulant film thickness to within 6 % of the measured 1. 62 mm. An energy balance was completed on the reticulated ammonia refrigeration system at Whareroa to provide {{a better understanding of the}} system dynamics. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain complete agreement between heat load and heat of rejection for the ammonia system – the level of agreement ranged from 8. 9 to 30. 2 %. This variability seems to be explained by incomplete monitoring of the condenser fan speed. Although the predictive model produced results that agreed with three other researchers the level of efficiency determined by the model is dependent on the accuracy of a number of variables including the thermal conductivity value (k-value) chosen for the foulant material creating the insulating film on the <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser</b> coils. This is easy to determine for a pure compound but there is no model available to predict the thermal conductivity of a composite fouling material. Consequently this would be one improvement that could be made to the model in the future. Model capabilities would also be enhanced by incorporating the commercial version of EES. This would allow the model to be automated for ‘on-line’ real time system monitoring. The evaporative condensers at Fonterra Whareroa that were used for this study are ‘base load’ heat of rejection units, i. e. they are always fully loaded or turned off. Consequently it is recommended that the model is further tested on refrigeration systems with variable loads to determine the accuracy for partial load situations, and also on systems with a range of fouling materials. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{environmental}} profile of a semi-indirect ceramic evaporative cooler (SIEC) with low environmental impact and heat pipe (HP) heat-exchanger battery with that of a Split class heat pump. The comparison is carried out for two different climate areas in Spain, one a continental or inland climate (Valladolid) and the other representative of a Western European climate (Bilbao). The environmental and economic study is conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) with two software tools provided by SimaProÂ® 7. 1 LCA suite (Eco-indicator[`] 99 Â® and EPS 2000 Â®). After the LCA sensitivity analysis results it can be clearly inferred that the major contribution to the categories of damage in both facilities (SIEC and heat pump) is the class of abiotic resources, followed by human health. The high contribution to environmental impact of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser,</b> part of the SIEC-HP, should also be emphasized. With regard to the heat pump, electricity proves to be the main environmental burden, followed by the pump infrastructure, in which the compressor, the external battery, the external fan and the connection have the highest impacts, respectively. The ceramic evaporative cooler SIEC-HP is both environmentally and economically more profitable than the heat pump in the region of Castilla y León (Valladolid), whereas in humid coastal areas it proves less useful due to the higher operating costs associated to this equipment. Finally, the electricity savings expressed in CO 2 emissions are compared. In the inland or dry area of Spain, the ceramic evaporative cooler is the most suitable option, whilst the heat pump proves more appropriate for cities with a humid climate such as those in the Basque Country (Bilbao).

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein and Douglas Reindl; 166 pp. Industrial refrigeration systems {{can be found in}} applications ranging from ice making to food processing and preservation to industrial chemical processes. These systems typically consist of many different components, each component may be produced by a different manufacturer. The operational data provided by the different manufacturers for each component is used by system designers to specify installation and operational procedures of the system. Often times, the optimum control of an individual piece of equipment results in sub-optimal system performance due to unforeseen interactions between the different system components. It is important to identify and monitor key parameters of the system, such as power consumption and refrigeration effect, in order to optimize the performance. The efforts of this research focused on modeling an operating, ammonia vapor compression, refrigeration system serving a two-temperature food storage and distribution facility located near Milwaukee, WI. This system utilized a combination of both single-screw and reciprocating compressors operating under single-stage compression, an <b>evaporative</b> <b>condenser,</b> and both liquid overfeed and direct expansion evaporators. The model was verified with experimental data recorded from the system and then used to identify alternative designs and operating techniques that lead to optimum system performance. Changes in system operation such as variable frequency (VFD) or multi-speed motor control on condenser and evaporator fans, head pressure control, refrigerant temperature control, and aspects of load sharing between compressors were investigated. Also, the performance of several alternative system designs was investigated. The aspects of alternative system design that were examined are condenser sizing, two-stage compression, load separation by addition of another suction level, and thermosiphon. A 31 percent reduction in annual energy usage and a 21 percent reduction in annual peak electrical demand over the current system operation is predicted to be possible with the most feasible of the optimization techniques and designs examined implemented.
