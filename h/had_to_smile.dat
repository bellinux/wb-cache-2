[...] Perhaps they were glad to have Custer killed, and were really pleased to shake the hand with the man who had killed him!" ...|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E

He lives three hours away from his parents' house but much to Chizuru's surprise, on his visit with the family he introduced his fiancee. He cares about Ryu and Chizuru a lot, and eventually tells Chizuru he loves her like a little sister. He calls Chizuru by the nickname [...] "Chii" [...] because a person <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>smile</b> when saying it, {{and he wanted to}} cheer her up.|$|R
