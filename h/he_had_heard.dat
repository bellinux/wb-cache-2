5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man.

5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did this because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of Duke William's landing in England, {{and needed to}} rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} {{thirteen}} Jervis ran away and joined the navy at Woolwich, London. After a short time he returned home as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> his family were very upset at his disappearance. Lady Jane Hamilton (mother of Sir William Hamilton) and Lady Burlington became aware of Jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. Eventually they introduced the Jervis family to Admiral George Townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was worried that she could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E

This {{performance}} attracted Shawthing Entertainment's Greg Shaw, who became their manager. The band worked with Stuart Stuart (The Veronicas), Dave Nicholas (INXS, Sting), Trey Bruce (Faith Hill) and Randy Staub (Nickelback, Metallica) on song writing or recordings. They met John Woodruff (Savage Garden, Evermore), after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> their early demos, who became their next manager in 2001. He recommended them to Sony BMG.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{was persuaded}} {{to return to}} the studio to record a new album by American record {{producer}} Joshua Henry, who was a fan of Fay's Deram albums after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> them played by his father. Fay and Henry assembled a group of musicians that included guitarist Ray Russell and drummer Alan Rushton, who had both played on Time of the Last Persecution. Recording took place across ten days at Snap Studios in North London with engineer Guy Massey. It was released to critical acclaim, featuring on several critic's year-end lists and reaching number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. Fay donated the proceeds from the album to the humanitarian aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E

Though Xu never received Tang's order to abandon the defense, on the night of December 12 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that Nanking had been captured and so decided to withdraw on his own accord. During the night he managed to evacuate most of his unit across the Yangtze River just before Japanese naval units blockaded the river.|$|E
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> {{no mention of the}} alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E

5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} that he wanted to see the infant king, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{moved to}} Beauchamp, {{as he was}} loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his {{political}} principles. People knew of Sharp's earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. Witnesses placed Beauchamp in Frankfort {{the night of the}} killing, and his host, Joel Scott, said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> Beauchamp leave the house during the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E

5|$|The lyricism in Delius's early {{compositions}} {{reflected the}} music <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> in America and {{the influences of}} European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius's music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Edmund's cult re-emerged in the 10th {{century and}} the site of his burial grew wealthy {{as a result of}} {{receiving}} grants of land from royally connected benefactors. In about 986, the monks of Ramsey Abbey commissioned Abbo of Fleury to write an account of the saint's life and early cult. In his preface or dedicatory epistle Abbo addresses the work to St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury 960-988. Dunstan himself {{is the source of the}} story of the martyrdom, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> told long before, in the presence of King Æthelstan, by an old man who swore an oath that he had been Edmund's own sword-bearer (armiger) on the fatal day. Abbo therefore clearly makes Dunstan, then still living and the recipient of his work, the authority for what he has to say.|$|E
