25|$|IgG {{antibody}} precipitin testing from serum is useful, {{as positive}} results {{are found in}} between 69–90% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be {{used in conjunction with}} other tests. Various forms exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescent <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassay</b> (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional counterimmunoelectrophoresis. IgG may not be entirely specific for ABPA, as high levels are also found in chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) alongside more severe radiological findings.|$|E
25|$|EIA (<b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassay)</b> detects {{antibodies}} using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used {{in these}} assays is often recombinant dsDNA or from calf thymus extract. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies, the antibodies will bind to the DNA and can then be visualised using enzyme-linked secondary antibodies. This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from denatured dsDNA. EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E

40|$|Summary: An {{evaluation}} of <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> for determination of thyroxine in serum (EMIT ABA thyroxine assay, Syva Corp., ENZYMUN assay thyroxine, Boehringer Mannheim) and of thyroxine binding index (ENZYMUN assay TBI 1), Boehringer Mannheim) is presented. The precision of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> was adequate (coefficients of variation ranged {{from day to}} day with EMIT from 3 - 11 % and with ENZYMUN from 4 - 11 %). Both assays are specific and easy to perform. About 20 unknown samples can be analyzed in duplicate by EMIT within 60 minutes and by ENZYMUN within 250 minutes. A comparison of the results obtained by <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> and radio-immunoassay in a series of about 100 patients showed a good correlation between both methods. The precision of the ENZYMUN TBI assay was adequate (coefficient of variation {{from day to day}} 4. 9 %) and the thyroxine/TBI-ratio correlated well with the thyroxine/TBG-ratio.

40|$|Newly {{available}} assays offer {{alternatives to}} conventional microscopic examination for Cryptosporidium spp. We compared two <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays,</b> ProSpect Cryptosporidium microtiter assay (Alexon, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.) and Color Vue Cryptosporidium assay (Serady, Indianapolis, Ind.), and a direct immunofluorescent assay, Merifluor Cryptosporidium kit (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, Ohio), with acid-fast Kinyoun-staining {{for the detection}} of Cryptosporidium spp. Examinations were performed on 129 stool specimens received from patients during a recent waterborne outbreak. A specimen was considered positive when organisms could be identified visually by acid-fast and immunofluorescent stains or if organisms could be visualized by either acid-fast or immunofluorescent stain and detected by both <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays.</b> The final number of positive specimens was 55. No single procedure detected all 55 positive specimens. Of these, ProSpect and Color Vue detected 52 (sensitivity, 94. 5 %), and the Kinyoun stain and Merifluor detected 53 (sensitivity, 96. 4 %). The final number of negative specimens was 74. One false-positive result was seen with both the Kinyoun stain and the ProSpect assay. The Color Vue and ProSpect assays required the most hands-on technologist time. The ProSpect assay and Merifluor kit were easiest to perform. The acid-fast stain was difficult to interpret. The Merifluor kit was easiest to read and was adaptable to both batch and single testing. Overall, the Kinyoun stain and the Merifluor test were preferable to both of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> because of the high reagent cost and hands-on time required for the <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays.</b> The difficult interpretation of the Kinyoun stain smears made the Merifluor a more desirable test despite its higher cost.

40|$|During February and March 1984, 207 fecal {{samples from}} infants and {{children}} with gastroenteritis were tested for rotavirus with four techniques: two <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> (Rotazyme; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill., and Enzygnost-Rotavirus; Calbiochem-Behring, La Jolla, Calif.) and two latex agglutination tests (Rotalex; Orion Research, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and Slidex Rota-Kit; Biomérieux). All stool samples were also tested for yeasts and bacterial pathogens. Electron microscopy was used to investigate discrepant results. We found 47 % positive samples with Enzygnost-Rotavirus, 38 % with Rotazyme, 37 % with Slidex Rota-Kit, and 34 % with Rotalex. No specimen was found positive by Rotazyme only or Slidex Rota-Kit only. On the contrary, 12 samples which were positive with Enzygnost-Rotavirus only and 3 which were positive with Rotalex only were not confirmed as positive by electron microscopy. Both <b>enzyme</b> <b>immunoassays</b> gave 6 % equivocal results; Slidex Rota-Kit gave significantly fewer equivocal results than did Rotalex: 2. 9 % versus 9. 7 % (P less than 0. 01).

A high frequency of weakly positive results was found in ''aged'' samples: 61. 9 % of antibody to hepatitis C virus-positive patients whose sera had been stored for more than 2 yr had optical densities less than two times the cut-off values in contrast to 7. 9 % of those whose sera had been stored for less than 2 yr (p < 0. 0001). A significantly lower proportion of patients who had optical densities less than two times the cut-off values were reactive in subsequent samples, 27. 5 % vs. 87. 5 % (p < 0. 0001).
