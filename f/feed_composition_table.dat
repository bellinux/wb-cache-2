Utilizaram-se 480 pintos machos, Cobb, com 1 dia de idade que foram submetidos à metodologia de coleta total de excretas e distribuídos em 9 tratamentos com 6 repetições. Os tratamentos foram compostos por 4 alimentos protéicos de origem vegetal (farelo de soja, soja {{integral}} tostada, soja micronizada e farelo de glúten de milho) que substituíram a ração referência (RR) em 30 % e 4 alimentos protéicos de origem animal (farinha de carne e ossos 40 % e 45 % de PB, farinha de peixe e farinha de vísceras), que substituíram a RR em 20 %. Simultaneamente, 6 repetições de 8 aves foram colocadas em jejum para a determinação das perdas endógenas. As variáveis estudadas foram energia metabolizável aparente (EMA), verdadeira (EMV) e as EMA e EMV corrigidas para balanço de nitrogênio (EMAn, EMVn). Os alimentos de origem vegetal obtiveram valores de energia inferiores aos obtidos nas tabelas usuais de composição dos alimentos e os alimentos de origem animal, valores superiores. An {{experiment was}} conducted in the Poultry Farm Sector of the Universidade Federal de Lavras (UFLA) with 6 days period duration to determine the energy values in protein sources for broiler chickens in the pre-initial phase. A total of 480 male chickens from Cobb line with one day old were submitted to the method of total excreta collection, allotted to nine treatments with six replicates each. The experimental unit consisted of eight chickens. The treatments were: 1 - reference diet (RD); 2 - RD {{with the addition of}} soybean meal; 3 - RD with the addition of toasted soybean meal; 4 - RD with the addition of micronized soybean meal; 5 - RD with corn gluten meal; 6 - RD with meat and bone meal 40; 7 - RD meat and bone meal 45; 8 - RD with fish meat; 9 - RD with viscera meal. The protein feeds from vegetal by-products replaced RD by 30 % and the protein feeds from animal by-product replaced by 20 %. Simultaneously, six replicates of 8 chickens were placed in fasting to determine endogenous losses. The analyzed variables were the values of apparent metabolizable energy (AME), true metabolizable energy (TME) and the nitrogen balance corrected AME and TME (AMEn and TMEn, respectively).

40|$|To {{determine}} {{total and}} phytic phosphorus and endogenous phytase activity in cereals, oilseeds and by-products, feed ingredients used in animal {{production in the}} tropics were evaluated. The cereals and by-products were yellow corn, sorghum, hard wheat, broken rice, wheat bran, fine and gross defatted corn germ and bran, and rice polishing; the oilseeds and by-products were cotton seed and cotton meal, and soy, palm oil and coconut meals. In five samples of each ingredient, phytic acid was measured by a colorimetric procedure and phytase activity with an enzymatic-colorimetric method. In addition, mineral and chemical components were determined by conventional methods. Crude protein, ether extract, ash and mineral content were similar to values reported in <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> <b>tables.</b> Total P concentration in cereal grains and by-products ranged from 0. 12 to 1. 57 %, and in oilseeds and by-products, from 0. 43 to 1. 34 %. In cereals and oilseeds, phytic acid concentrations varied from 0. 08 to 0. 49 %, and in by-products, from 0. 24 to 1. 13 %. Significant regressions were found between total and phytic P in cereals and by-products, and in oilseeds and by-products. In the former, correlations were also found between phytic P and Mg, K and Ca content. Phytase activity (U/kg) was significantly higher in wheat (1565). Rice, wheat bran and rice polishing had values > 100 U/kg. The remaining grains and by-products did not show phytase activity...|$|R
40|$|This {{book was}} {{assembled}} using {{the latest information}} for compiling the nutrient requirements of sheep, goats, cattle and water buffalo. Because {{of the complexity of}} the interactions between an animal, its diet, its physiological state, and the environment; the values depicting the nutrient requirements are estimates and not absolutes. These values, however, are considered to be adequate to meet the minimum requirements of healthy animals maintained in a thermoneutral environment. The mean energy and protein values used in the nutrient tables were arrived at from combining values found in the literature and those provided in personal communication with animal nutritionists in many developing countries. In some cases, only two or three observations were found for estimating the values used. Future research in ruminant nutrition should be designed to provide information needed to confirm or modify the values presented here. <b>Feed</b> <b>composition</b> <b>tables</b> representing <b>feeds</b> commonly found in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East have been included for an easy reference when formulating diets. Units of expression of data in the <b>tables</b> of <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> and animal nutrient requirements are presented using three systems: Metabolizable energy (ME), net energy (NE); total digestible nutrients (TDN) and Scandinavian feed units (FU). conversion factors from SE to ME, TDN, etc., are presented in Section 1 for those who need this information. Also a list of abbreviations used appear in Appendix 5. A brief discussion showing three methods of calculating rations by hand are presented. Each of these methods permits some consideration for calculating a 2 ̆ 2 least-cost 2 ̆ 2 ration. It is important, however, that the person formulating a diet has a knowledge of the animal 2 ̆ 7 s nutrient requirements, an understanding of the digestibility and utilization of feeds and the various combinations required to formulate a diet adequate to supply all the needs of animals. Examples of hand calculated rations appear in Appendix 3. Adulteration of feedstuffs is a common complaint from livestock producers in many developing countries.

The agreement between the five methods was evaluated using the Kappa and weighted Kappa coefficients. The Nutritional Support Table, a Brazilian traditional food <b>composition</b> <b>table</b> and the Brazilian household expenditure survey were used in Method 1. Brazilian Food <b>Composition</b> <b>Table</b> and the Table for the Assessment of Household Measures (Pinheiro) were used in Methods 2 and 3.

The proposed approach, treating the process as a heat engine, allows to directly quantify distillation performance (in terms of energy intensity & efficiency) based on the components boiling points and <b>feed</b> <b>composition.</b> In addition, this approach reviews and formulates simple, approximate and essentially non-iterative calculation procedures to quickly estimate the energy efficiency of distillation. These estimations may be applied to identify opportunities to save significant amounts of energy. The {{results show that the}} reboiler duty for low relative volatility is relatively independent of the heat of vaporization and <b>feed</b> <b>composition,</b> while being reciprocally proportional to the Carnot efficiency of the distillation column. The internal efficiency for distillation of mixtures with low relative volatility has a maximum of about 70 % for a symmetrical feed (equimolar ratio) and decreases to zero for unsymmetrical <b>feed</b> <b>compositions</b> approaching infinite dilution. With increasing relative volatility, the maximum efficiency is preserved, but the locus shifts towards lower light component fractions.

40|$|In {{the domain}} of {{qualitative}} constraint reasoning, a subfield of AI which has evolved in the past 25 years, {{a large number of}} calculi for efficient reasoning about spatial and temporal entities has been developed. Reasoning techniques developed for these constraint calculi typically rely on so-called <b>composition</b> <b>tables</b> of the calculus at hand, which allow for replacing semantic reasoning by symbolic operations.

40|$|International audienceNatural {{hydrocarbon}} mixtures {{are composed}} of very many components. Usually, several components are lumped into pseudo-components to reduce the dimensionality of the equilibrium flash calculations. An interesting alternative to lumping {{is the use of}} semi-continuous thermodynamics, which enables a better characterization of mixture compositions. Traditionally, in the semi-continuous approach, the <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> is approximated by a standard distribution function. Then, a Gaussian quadrature is used to find discrete carbon numbers representing the "pseudo-components", for which a discrete flash can be performed. However, the <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> can be random and/or far from classical distributions. In the quadrature method of moments (QMoM), developed by Lage (Lage, Comput. Chem. Eng. 31 (2007) 782 - 799), an optimal quadrature rule is used, considering the <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> distribution as the weight function. In this work, a hidden feature of QMoM is revealed, by identifying a distribution function used to approximate a newly considered dependence, which involves the <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> and the component liquid mole numbers. This dependence is extremely smooth, and, the most important, the shape of the function remains identical for any composition, pressure and temperature. The smoothness of the distribution enables a really good accuracy in solving the quadrature. The calculation of the quadrature is based on a procedure which avoids problems due to the ill-conditioned nature of the problem, even for a larger number of pseudo-components (unlike the original QMoM formulation). An analytical delumping procedure can be used (with an extremely small computational effort) to recover detailed composition in each equilibrium phase. Comparisons between a full discrete flash and the semi-continuous description proved the QMoM to be highly accurate. Various test problems, including two-phase and multiphase flash calculations, showed that Lage's methodology is generally applicable, even in cases when no distribution function can model the <b>feed</b> <b>composition,</b> or several distribution functions are needed to model different portions of the mixture...|$|R

In the physical and reactive extractions, glycolaldehyde and acetic acid are extracted independently from each other. In the physical extraction, the <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> has a slight influence on the distribution coefficients and yields of both acetic acid extraction and glycolaldehyde co-extraction. In the reactive extraction, the acetic acid extraction and glycolaldehyde co-extraction are relatively independent of the <b>feed</b> <b>composition.</b> For a combined one-step acetic acid and glycolaldehyde extraction pure 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol solvent provides the highest yields. Although 40 wt. % tri-n-octylamine provides the best acetic acid extraction performance, a solvent containing more than 50 wt. % tri-n-octylamine in 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol is preferred for a two-step scenario in which acetic acid is extracted prior to glycolaldehyde, due to the decrease of glycolaldehyde co-extraction with increasing tri-n-octylamine concentratio...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing the Smoker equation, an {{analytical}} method {{equivalent to the}} McCabe-Thiele diagram method was developed to evaluate some simple control schemes for a binary distillation tower. The basis of evaluation was the steady-state deviations of product purities when the tower was subject to a sustained disturbance in <b>feed</b> <b>composition,</b> rate or enthalpy. The schemes proposed in this work were a simple feedforward and a feedback heat-balance control scheme. These control schemes were simulated on an IBM- 360 and IBM- 1620 digital computer. The feedback heat-balance control was further verified on a laboratory pilot-scale binary distillation tower separating a methanol-water mixture. These two control schemes handled <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> and enthalpy disturbances more successfully than the rate disturbance. In general, for one end control, the feedback heat-balance control {{was better than the}} simple feedforward one. For <b>feed</b> <b>composition</b> disturbance and two end control the simple feedforward control was the better one. The feedback heat-balance control was more suitable for system with high relative volatility and top composition control. Also, the closer the control tray {{to the end of the}} column, the better the product purity...|$|R
