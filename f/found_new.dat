5|$|After their {{defeat at}} the Convention, members of two {{minority}} caucuses helped to <b>found</b> <b>new</b> socialist organizations. At most 200 {{members of the}} Coalition Caucus joined Michael Harrington in forming the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which later became the Democratic Socialists of America. At its start, DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington. Second, {{many members of the}} Debs Caucus joined David McReynolds in reconstituting the Socialist Party USA also in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Although {{weakened}} {{and pushed}} south beyond the Huai River, the Southern Song <b>found</b> <b>new</b> ways to bolster its strong economy and defend {{itself against the}} Jin dynasty. It had able military officers such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The government sponsored massive shipbuilding and harbor improvement projects, {{and the construction of}} beacons and seaport warehouses to support maritime trade abroad, including at the major international seaports, such as Quanzhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, that were sustaining China's commerce.|$|E
5|$|As the temperance {{movement}} faded {{the bands}} <b>found</b> <b>new</b> benefactors in the colliery owners, and many bands {{took on the}} names of specific collieries. A memorable image {{of the connection between}} the collieries and brass bands came in 1985, when the Maerdy miners were filmed returning to work after the miners' strike, marching behind the village band.|$|E

5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work <b>found</b> <b>new</b> imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Docter began {{developing}} {{the film in}} 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, and Ralph Eggleston. Fellow Pixar director Andrew Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Daniel Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators <b>found</b> <b>new</b> ways to render fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose its fourth.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 American {{economist}} Paul Krugman (1953-) {{published a}} paper <b>founding</b> <b>New</b> trade theory, which attempts {{to explain the}} role of increasing returns to scale and network effects in international trade. In 1991 he published a paper <b>founding</b> <b>New</b> economic geography. His textbook International Economics (2007) appears on many undergraduate reading lists.

5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives <b>found</b> <b>new</b> homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach <b>found</b> <b>new</b> life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then <b>found</b> <b>new</b> applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Kaspersky's {{interest}} in IT security began in 1989, when his PC was infected by the Cascade virus, {{while working for}} the Ministry of Defense. He studied how the virus worked and developed a program to remove it. Afterwards he continually <b>found</b> <b>new</b> viruses and developed software to remove them, as a hobby. Early on Kaspersky's anti-virus software had just 40 virus definitions and was distributed mostly to friends.|$|E
5|$|Princeton did not rehire Wigner {{when his}} {{contract}} ran out in 1936. Through Gregory Breit, Wigner <b>found</b> <b>new</b> employment at the University of Wisconsin. There {{he met his}} first wife, Amelia Frank, who was a physics student there. However she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there. Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8, 1937, and he brought his parents to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile <b>found</b> <b>new</b> use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E

5|$|The {{magistrate}} {{also made}} {{a survey of the}} spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749former residents of the parts touched by fire had <b>found</b> <b>new</b> lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of dead and wounded is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, but the number remains uncertain. It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire, though.|$|E
5|$|The {{sideline}} 4...g5!? was {{not well}} regarded {{at the end of}} the 20th century. It weakens several squares—particularly f5 and h5—as they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any more. White can try to exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has <b>found</b> <b>new</b> supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of electric power, wind power <b>found</b> <b>new</b> applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks.|$|E
