5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b> Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|E

50|$|Jorge Luis Borges {{introduces}} many philosophical themes, and {{a number}} of fictional philosophers, in <b>his</b> short <b>stories.</b> A fictional philosophical movement {{is a part of the}} premise of <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, and the unnamed narrator of <b>his</b> <b>story</b> The Library of Babel could also be called a fictional philosopher. A fictional theologian is the subject of <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Three Versions of Judas.|$|R

5|$|White {{kept his}} job with Short Brothers and {{wrote in the}} evenings, as <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> did not make enough money for {{him to become a}} {{full-time}} author. In 1980 he taught a literature course at a Belfast branch of the Workers Educational Association.|$|E
5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E

Bowden, obsessed with Nazism and acts of the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share <b>his</b> <b>stories,</b> and their relationship stirs malice in each of them.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Tolkien was {{bitten by}} a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in <b>his</b> <b>stories,</b> {{although}} he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Director Rajnesh Domalpalli {{graduated}} with bachelor's and master's degrees {{in electrical engineering}} in 1984 and 1986.

5|$|During her narrative, Penelope expresses {{opinions}} on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making people look like fools and wonders why <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar. She dispels the rumour that she slept with Amphinomus and the rumour that she slept {{with all the}} suitors and consequently gave birth to Pan.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 he {{received}} the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction for <b>his</b> <b>story</b> collection Silent Retreats (University of Georgia Press, 1988). In 1988 <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Arcola Girls appeared in Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards.|$|R

50|$|Each of {{the stories}} told within Metamorphoses can be {{analyzed}} in this fashion and it is even worth noting the story of King Midas. His dramatic action can be followed over {{the entire length of}} the play for we are introduced to <b>his</b> <b>story</b> in the beginning and are not subjected to the resolution of <b>his</b> <b>story</b> until the end of the play and <b>his</b> <b>story</b> is actually the last one addressed in the play.|$|R
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.|$|E
5|$|Several of <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> have {{inspired}} other writers and directors. In 1987, the Italian director Francesco Rosi directed the movie Cronaca di una morte annunciata based on Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Several film adaptations {{have been made}} in Mexico, including Miguel Littin's La Viuda de Montiel (1979), Jaime Humberto Hermosillo's Maria de mi corazón (1979), and Arturo Ripstein's El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (1998).|$|E
50|$|The movie {{ends with}} a British civil servant urging Starkey not to print <b>his</b> <b>story,</b> fearing for the {{consequences}} if the truth about Brinn gets out. Starkey, however, decides to print <b>his</b> <b>story</b> anyway and returns to his wife.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>his</b> <b>story</b> [...] "History of the Necronomicon", Lovecraft {{states that}} it is rumored that artist R.U. Pickman (from <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Pickmans Model) owned a Greek {{translation}} of the text, but it vanished along with the artist in early 1926.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, he {{won first}} place [...] "for the best short story in Norman" [...] at the Fête Nouormande in Bricquebec for <b>his</b> <b>story</b> {{entitled}} [...] "La frontchièthe". He won first place again in 2008 for <b>his</b> <b>story</b> entitled [...] "Feu et feunmée".|$|R
5|$|Sukumar's future {{projects}} {{include a}} film with Ram Charan and Devi Sri Prasad each, which marks the latter's on-screen debut as an actor.

5|$|The {{years from}} 1949 to 1953 are often {{considered}} {{the highlight of}} Vandersteen's career, when he combined large production with consistent high quality in <b>his</b> <b>stories,</b> the jokes, the many characters, and the graphical aspects, in which the charming quirkiness of the early years was balanced with the more rigorous ligne claire of Hergé. Many of these stories were loosely based on popular classics, ranging from Alexandre Dumas over Buffalo Bill to Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, with as culmination his comic in {{two parts of the}} legend of Till Eulenspiegel, made for Kuifje.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien never {{expected}} <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> to become popular, but by sheer accident {{a book called}} The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 {{to the attention of}} Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.|$|E
50|$|History: Mankind and <b>his</b> <b>story</b> (1948).|$|R
50|$|The story {{appears in}} The Newgate Calendar, a crime {{catalogue}} of Newgate Prison in London. While historians {{tend to believe}} Bean never existed or <b>his</b> <b>story</b> has been greatly exaggerated, <b>his</b> <b>story</b> has passed into local folklore and {{become part of the}} Edinburgh tourism industry.|$|R

5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Paris was {{the home}} and subject for some of France's {{greatest}} writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written {{while he was in}} exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> at the National Library.|$|E
5|$|Following his release, Dostoyevsky read {{a myriad}} of {{literature}} and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies and increasingly sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Gambler and The Brothers Karamazov. With {{the help of his}} brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazinesVremya and Epochin which some of <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued in the conservative The Russian Messenger until the introduction of A Writer's Diary, which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, remain unfinished.|$|E
