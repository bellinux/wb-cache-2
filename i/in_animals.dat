40|$|Abstract. Struvite {{crystallization}} is {{an efficient}} method for phosphorus recovery from animal manure wastewater. However, {{large amount of}} organic coexisting impurities, contained <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> manure wastewater, might influence struvite crystallization. In this study, the effect of typical organic matter contained <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> manure wastewater, such as butyric acid, fulvic acid, tetracycline, on phosphorus recovery was examined. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) {{with an increase in}} butyric acid concentration <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> manure wastewater, phosphorus recovery efficiency did not change significantly; (2) with an increase in fulvic acid concentration <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> manure wastewater, phosphorus recovery efficiency decreased obviously; (3) with an increase in tetracycline concentration <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> manure wastewater, phosphorus recovery efficiency decreased slightly...|$|R

50|$|The {{alliance}} {{has been}} criticized for its stance on the use of antibiotics <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> foods <b>in</b> agriculture. Data from the Food and Drug Administration has shown that 80% of all antibiotics sold in the United States are used <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> feed. The alliance has argued on their website that, for example, 41% of the sales for antibiotics <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> feed are tetracycline antibiotics but that tetracyclines make up only 4% of the sales of human antibiotics. They argue that as long as different antibiotics are used <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> feed than are used for humans, the use of antibiotics <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> feed should not produce an antibiotic resistance problem for humans. This argument {{has been criticized}} for ignoring the changing use of antibiotics for humans and that resistance to one antibiotic can produce resistance in others.|$|R

5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on both natural and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration <b>in</b> <b>Animals</b> (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles <b>in</b> <b>animals,</b> including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood.
