40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{validate}} a French version of <b>Exercise</b> <b>Processes</b> of Change Questionnaire (PCQ) and to examine its psychometric properties and its relation with the other components of Transtheoritical Model (TTM). Methods: Two hundred ninety-three subjects (198 women), 16 - 65 years old, answered the PCQ and other questionnaires concerning the other components of TTM and concerning exercise intrinsic motivation. Results: Firstly, a confirmatory factor analysis reports good indexes of fit for models distinguishing the 10 processes postulated by the MTT. A significant correlation between both second-order latent variables, distinguishing experiential and behavioural processes (r = 0. 879) suggests that the split of ten processes of change into two higher-order classes does not improve the model. Secondly, <b>exercise</b> <b>processes</b> of change were significantly associated with the other components of TTM and four dimensions of exercise intrinsic motivation. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to examine}} the {{applicability}} of the rhythm exercises used in pre-school music education in Turkey, and the abilities and views of the pre-school teachers concerning the issue. With this purpose, the rhythmic accompaniments used by pre-school teachers in music education and their observations about these accompaniments were analyzed. The sample of the study consisted of 3 pre-school teachers and 60 students in Antalya. The teachers taught the students 5 songs and had them accompany the songs with rhythm. Because the study had a qualitative research design, in-depth data gathering with a limited sample size was aimed. The data was gathered through reports written by the teachers about the rhythm exercises. The data gathered were analyzed using the qualitative analysis method of descriptive analysis. Observations of the teachers about the rhythm <b>exercise</b> <b>process,</b> the difficulties encountered during the exercises, the reactions of the children to the exercises, the preferences of the students concerning the musical instruments during the exercises, the rhythms that the children found to be difficult, and the activities done to develop the creative abilities of the children during the exercises were recorded. In addition, the views of the teachers on how the rhythm exercises can contribute to the musical development of the children and how these exercises can be used in other learning fields were examined. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{grounded}} theory driven study explored the predominant categories and concepts involved with perceptions of exercise among school aged children with asthma. Ten children (five males, five females), ages 8 - 12, with various asthma disease severity, were interviewed in their homes. In addition, nine parents completed a health history questionnaire. The emergent {{grounded theory}}: The {{process of creating}} perceptions of exercise was identified from the data. The ongoing creation of perceptions of exercise was influenced by four predominant categories: perceived benefits, striving for normalcy, exercise influences, and asthma's influence. Because process is an ongoing occurrence, the four predominant categories may influence the creation of exercise perceptions simultaneously, or at different times and in various ways dependent upon {{the characteristics of the}} child and their unique situations and experiences (context). Perceived benefits, striving for normalcy, exercise influences, and asthma's influence were identified categories involved with the interactions, actions, and consequences interwoven throughout the creation of perceptions of <b>exercise</b> <b>process.</b> These categories help explain how exercise perceptions are developed from the participants' perspective. The process of creating perceptions of exercise is a continuous, circular, happening with the consequences leading to the development of exercise perceptions. The context may change but the overall process retains applicability to creating perceptions of exercise. The subjective insight gained throughout the development of the theory: the creation of perceptions of exercise, gives light to numerous areas for future nursing research and practice in hopes of improving the overall quality of life among this population...|$|E
40|$|We {{can more}} {{effectively}} take the physical skills of individual people into consideration from various {{points of view}} when we focus on evaluating their skills while exercising. We can focus on their maximum levels of speed and power, their smoothness {{through a series of}} exercises, their instantaneous force, repeatability, and their adjustability to agitation or obstacles such as circumjacent people or nature. A lot of exercise skills can relatively and easily be quantitatively evaluated by carefully analyzing the results and performance. However, it is difficult to evaluate the "repeatability" aspect, which is only one of exercise skill, when judging its degree from only viewing the given exercise. An example of a physical <b>exercise</b> <b>process</b> that can contribute stable results would need to be equivalent to a "skill" such as hitting a home run each time. We believe that the acquisition of a given skill is very useful in fields such as physical training. Therefore, we examined the repeatability aspect from this point of view. We also used an antagonism power index calculated using EMG to achieve such purposes. The index represents any adjustments made in the output power from the muscles. I thought that the adjust function of the output power of the muscles would be very useful when evaluating the exercise skills of a given individual. The antagonism power was calculated using the quasi-muscular tension and a skeletal muscle model consisting of one joint and two muscles. We also made a comparison between the unskilled state and a skilled state. As a result, the differences in exercise skill appeared to be antagonism power. Therefore, we thought that antagonism power was effective enough for creating a new exercise skill evaluation index that we define in this paper. Copyright 2011 ACM...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Consolidated Edison Company shut down the Indian Point 2 commercial nuclear power plant in February 2000 because a tube had ruptured in a steam generator, raising the possibility that radioactively contaminated water could leak into the environment. In this case, {{the total amount of}} radioactivity released posed no threat because the amount of radioactivity released was about one thousandth of the dose an individual receives from a chest X-ray. However, {{in the event of a}} more serious emergency at Indian Point 2, protecting the public from a radioactive release presents more substantial challenges because the plant is located in a heavily populated area. This report reviews issues associated with emergency preparedness protocols associated with the plant. GAO found that a more proactive approach to correct recurring weaknesses could have improved the emergency preparedness plan during the February 2000 emergency. This emergency demonstrated the importance of effective, clear communication networks, both on-site regarding the need to ensure that pagers work well to notify key personnel of an emergency, as well as off-site, regarding communication about the extent and magnitude of the emergency. Exercises, although playing a valuable role in preparing for and assessing radiological emergency readiness, more than likely will not identify the human reactions and all communications issues that could arise in a real radiological emergency. In this regard the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) interact interactions with the states for routine communications needs to be reassessed [...] at least for the 17 states where another entity is responsible for radiological emergency responses. The lack of knowledge by the four Indian Point counties regarding the flexibility in FEMA's regulations to spend more time at various emergency levels and its proposed streamlined <b>exercise</b> <b>process</b> demonstrate that FEMA's reliance on the state to communicate with the local communities did not work in this case. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{most common}} {{problems}} in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders are eye contact, {{being able to}} follow objects {{for a long time}} and lack of attention. Sports activities are known to prevent the negative symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The Badminton sports branch has a positive effect on the individual's object control, ball focus, and attention, reaction, perception and coordination characteristics. For this reason, racket sports are considered to be an important tool in reducing the lack of attention in individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Aim: The aim of this study, Investigation of the effect of simplified Badminton exercises on attention focus development of individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and is the assessment of the level of retention of an acquisition. Material and Method: The study group was randomly selected 3 out of 6 children who are not mentally retarded and responded to commands among 10 children aged 12 - 14 years in Isparta Gülşen Önal Autistic Children Education Centre. The mean age of children was 12. 6 ± 1. 15 years, height was 154, 3 ± 5, 13 cm and weight was 52 ± 3 kg. Benton Visual Memory Test, Bourdon Visual Attention Test and Stroop Effect Test were used as the measurement tool. Children were performed adaptation exercises for 2 weeks and from simple to difficult badminton exercise drills for 10 weeks. For each individual, 3 studies were performed at different times and 60 minutes per week. Tests were performed at 3 different periods, to be 10 weeks Badminton <b>exercise</b> <b>process</b> before and after and also retention test after 8 weeks interval. The obtained data were evaluated by Wilcoxon test. Results: According to the results of all measurement instruments of the students participating in the research, there is a numerical rise between pre - test and post - test values. When the results of the retention test with the last test are evaluated, there was no decrease in the two participants according to the Benton visual memory test results, but the other participant had also decline, although not at the beginning level. Burdon attention test and Stroop effect test showed that there was no return to baseline in all participants despite a numerical decrease. Conclusion: We can say that Badminton exercise program has a positive effect on attention level. Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder can be said to have a positive influence on the development of eye contact, long-time focus of objects and attention level development. Badminton exercises can be offered as a model to improve attentiveness to children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder if the duration of participatory study is increased...|$|E
