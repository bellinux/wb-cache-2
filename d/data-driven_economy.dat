40|$|The {{numerous}} debates {{triggered by}} the increased collection and {{processing of personal data}} for various- and often unaccountable- purposes are particularly vivid at the EU level. Two interlinked, and to some extent conflicting, initiatives are relevant here: the development of EU strategies promoting a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy</b> and the current reform of the EU personal data protection legal framework {{in the context of the}} adoption of a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this context, and focusing on the development of Big Data practices, smart devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), this Study shows that the high degree of opacity of many contemporary data processing activities directly affects the right of the individuals to know what is being done with the data collected about them. This Study argues that the promotion of a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy</b> should not underestimate the challenges raised for privacy and personal data protection and that strengthening the rights of digital citizens should be the main focus of the current debates around the GDPR...|$|E

40|$|Since Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler's Capital as Power was {{published}} (2009), the co-called reputation economy has flourished. “World 3. 0 ” businesses such as Uber, TaskRabbit and Airbnb offer users access to peer-to-peer shares, services and experiences, scaled up via online platforms. Platform users rely on reviews to determine whom they can trust. Peer-to- peer lending platforms allow borrowers to sidestep banks. “Fintech” startups such as ZestFinance and VisualDNA afford borrowers with poor credit scores better interest rates, using big data analytics to calculate their creditworthiness {{more effectively than}} a FICO® credit score. As VisualDNA puts it, “not everyone has a credit score [...] . but everyone has a personality. ” 1 In this world, reputation and character have been fully operationalized as forms of capital. For Rachel Botsman and other apostles of the reputation <b>economy,</b> <b>data-driven</b> collaborative consumption puts something “human” back into the economy, and empowers individuals, as micro-entrepreneurs, to rely less on corporate infrastructure. For sceptics such as Alison Hearn, the reputation economy, far from diffusing corporate power, merely increases performative pressures placed on neoliberal subjects. What is a definition of reputation capital commensurate with the CasP approach? Can the reputation economy under any circumstances drive toward what Nina Power has termed decapitalism: “cutting off the heads of those who control technology – decapitating capitalism, as it were”? 2 Or, is reputation merely another manifestation of power as “confidence in obedience”? 3 An answer to these questions, I argue, necessitates an expansion of Capital as Power’s discussion of private regulation to include individuals’ acts of projecting, disciplining and self-disciplining personal behaviour...|$|R

40|$|From 10 January to 26 April 2017 the European Commission {{carried out}} a public {{consultation}} on Building a European Data Economy. The key legal question of the initiative is how access and use rights in industrial data, as a digital resource, should be defined and allocated {{in order to achieve}} the objectives of the EU <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy.</b> The present analysis focuses on the proposals for new rights in industrial data, and takes a methodological perspective of designing a regulatory intervention. The overall argument is that the ‘intervention logic’ behind the proposals for a data producer’s right does not appear straightforward, and that keeping the scenario of non-intervention by such rights might not be the least optimal option among the possible ‘ways forward’...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new forms of interactions in the online environment, as social media, search engine and e-commerce has shifted the business industry and introduced a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy,</b> where data has become the new commodity. As a consequence, agents engaged in commercial activities have been collecting massive data from internet users, for instance, to predict consumer behaviour and to place tailored advertisement based on the users’ interests. Online behavioural advertisement can be legitimate and it has {{an important role in}} the digital economy, as it supports the offer of free services and it can result in better services and products to be offered to consumers. On the other hand, it raises privacy and data protection concerns, as it involves massive collection and processing of data by different agents. The legal treatment of profiling for online behavioural advertisement shall substantially change with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation, which brings new provisions for processing personal data, particularly in the online environment. Given the relevance of the new Regulation, its legislative process was surrounded by pressure and lobby by privacy authorities and industry. The final result of the Regulation is a long and complex framework, which imposes several new obligations to the companies, whereas user’s rights are substantially strengthened. However, privacy advocates argue that the final text of the Regulation could be better in terms of protecting users. The purpose of this work is to analyse whether: i) the final text GDPR provides an efficient protection of privacy and data protection in the digital context and; ii) whether the GDPR offers the agents engaged on online behavioural advertisement some level of flexibility on their business activities, insofar as they can explore the economic potentials of a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy</b> {{has led to}} a {{significant}} shortage of data scientists. To address this shortage, this study explores the prospects of outsourcing data analysis tasks to freelancers available on online labor markets (OLMs) by identifying the essential factors for this endeavor. Specifically, we explore the skills required from freelancers, collect information about the skills present on major OLMs, and identify the main hurdles for out-/crowd-sourcing data analysis. Adopting a sequential mixed-method approach, we interviewed 20 data scientists and subsequently surveyed 80 respondents from OLMs. Besides confirming the need for expected skills such as technical/mathematical capabilities, it also identifies less known ones such as domain understanding, an eye for aesthetic data visualization, good communication skills, and a natural understanding of the possibilities/limitations of data analysis in general. Finally, it elucidates obstacles for crowdsourcing like the communication overhead, knowledge gaps, quality assurance, and data confidentiality, which need to be mitigated...|$|E
40|$|This {{position}} {{statement of}} the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition has been released {{against the background of}} the European Free Flow of Data Initiative of the European Commission and the on-going political, economic and academic debate on the related issues. The Institute takes a stance as regards the introduction of exclusive rights in data, special legal protection of algorithms used in data analysis, as well as the questions on the applicability of the current EU legal framework for the sui-generis database rights and trade secrets to individual data and data-sets. The Institute sees no economic justification for the introduction of new exclusive rights in data, which could even hamper the functioning of the <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy.</b> In contrast, the statement emphasizes the importance of access to data in order to ensure the proper functioning of data-driven markets. It identifies the need for further research in this regard and recommends the general approach and principles to be considered if the special regulation of access to data is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As the <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy</b> {{is growing}} faster than ever {{and the demand for}} energy is being spurred, we are facing {{unprecedented}} challenges of improving energy efficiency in data centers. Effectively maximizing energy efficiency or minimising the cooling energy demand is becoming pervasive for data centers. This paper investigates overall energy consumption and the energy efficiency of cooling system for a data center in Finland as a case study. The power, cooling and energy consumption characteristics and operation condition of facilities are examined and analysed. Potential energy and cooling saving opportunities are identified and further suggestions for improving the performance of cooling system are put forward. Results are presented as a comprehensive evaluation of both the energy performance and good practices of energy efficient cooling operations for the data center. Utilization of an energy recovery concept for cooling system is proposed. The conclusion we can draw is that even though the analysed data center demonstrated relatively high energy efficiency, based on its power usage effectiveness value, there is still a significant potential for energy saving from its cooling systems.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on Geographic Information (GI) and libraries {{points out that}} American and Canadian librarians have long {{been aware of the}} intimate relationship between geospatial data and libraries. In Europe, though, there is almost no literature to this regard, and academic libraries that offer GI services are the exception. Despite the fact that European and National institutions are putting lots of efforts forward for making open data freely available to society, and for supporting full programs to generate business out of it, this paper examines why libraries and librarians are not perceived as key players in the (geo) <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy.</b> Starting with a survey addressed to academic librarians (in three European countries: Greece, Cyprus and Spain) about their GI knowledge and skills, the paper attempts to shed some light on the librarians' perception about their role in GI management, and to identify to what extent they are ready for providing GI services to their communities. The ultimate goal {{of this paper is to}} serve as a triggering factor to wake up European academic libraries, Librarianship programmers and librarians themselves, to encourage them to look for opportunities in geospatial data management...|$|E
40|$|The rise of {{big data}} {{promises}} {{a plethora of}} opportunities for a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy,</b> including accelerated innovation and growth, and increased productivity and competitiveness. However, {{there are still many}} legal, technological, societal and economic barriers that inhibit the use and reuse of data. It’s not enough to have large volumes of data to capitalize on the benefits of big data. Data, for instance, must also be accessible, reliable and up-to-date, and there must be clarity about the provenience of data and the right business model. Companies can collect data themselves, but with respect to many use cases, it seems to be more reasonable to reuse existing data, which was collected by third-parties, at least to some extent. However, this is only happening to a very limited extent. This paper presents and discusses conditions that are prerequisites to realize the full potential of data reuse. The viability of data reuse depends on (1) compliance with legislation, (2) technical possibilities, (3) public acceptance, and (4) business cases that yield added value. Data reuse and a thriving data economy rely on these conditions. Solutions are offered to policy makers and company leaders to facilitate data reuse and to advance the data economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of increasingly large and diverse data for meaningful interpretation and question answering is handicapped by human cognitive limitations. Consequently, semi-automatic abstraction of complex data within structured information spaces becomes increasingly important, if its knowledge content {{is to support}} intuitive, exploratory discovery. Exploration of skill demand {{is an area where}} regularly updated, multi-dimensional data may be exploited to assess capability within the workforce to manage the demands of the modern, technology- and <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy.</b> The knowledge derived may be employed by skilled practitioners in defining career pathways, to identify where, when and how to update their skillsets in line with advancing technology and changing work demands. This same knowledge may also be used to identify the combination of skills essential in recruiting for new roles. To address the challenges inherent in exploring the complex, heterogeneous, dynamic data that feeds into such applications, we investigate the use of an ontology to guide structuring of the information space, to allow individuals and institutions to interactively explore and interpret the dynamic skill demand landscape for their specific needs. As a test case we consider the relatively new and highly dynamic field of Data Science, where insightful, exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery are critical. We employ context-driven and task-centred scenarios to explore our research questions and guide iterative design, development and formative evaluation of our ontology-driven, visual exploratory discovery and analysis approach, to measure where it adds value to users’ analytical activity. Our findings reinforce the potential in our approach, and point us to future paths to build on...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{implemented}} the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which {{will replace the}} current, but obsolete, Data Protection Directive 95 / 46 /EC. When legally effective, May 25 th 2018, it will impose a much stricter regime and sanctions which magnitude may force bankruptcy. It increases dramatically the scope of what is considered personal data while restricting the processing as such. Thus, curtailing businesses’ opportunity to drive value through big data analytics. In an increasingly <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy,</b> where data is drawn {{in the same breath}} as competitive advantage, it may seem like the candle is burned at both ends. Pursuant to the issue a question arises to whether the value of data will diminish. Consequently, this work researches how the GDPR will impact the value of data, with an emphasis on value driven trough the big data value chain. The research is carried out in three phase: A preliminary analysis that identifies a set of value drivers; a primary analysis that identifies influences from the GDPR on said value drivers; and a case study on smart meter data. The results are presented as five assertions which make up the foundation of a discussion. The research finds that the short-term impact raises concern to limitations put on: realizing value in public interest; harnessing the power of algorithms in automated decision-making; and discovery of new knowledge through data mining. However, the positive long-term impact are expected to overshadow the negatives and to ensure a sustainable data-economy in the future. The research concerns a legislation that is yet to be enforced. The results are therefore predictions rather than hard facts, but will serve as insight to possible future challenges...|$|E
40|$|The {{digital economy}} has been termed a <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy.</b> Many digital {{business}} models {{are based on the}} collection and the processing of various types of data. Whereas the protection of personal data falls under the EU legal framework, and first and foremost the General Data Protection Regulation, the protection of data that goes beyond personal data may seem to be not protected at all. The latter circumstance is important in light of the EU Commission’s considerations on the introduction of rights related to the protection of non-personal data. Indeed, the question of whether {{there is a need for}} the protection of such data – called “industrial data” - and the issue of access to such data have also been at the center of a recent academic debate. Yet, whereas the protection of different types of data is highly relevant when it comes to the transfer and the processing of data, for the question of “access to data” data has to be considered more broadly, i. e. as a digital resource. Since in the digital economy it is no longer individual pieces of data (personal and/or non-personal) that play a role, but rather collections of data, digital data sets (which may consist of both personal and non-personal data) have become a digital asset of companies. The value of such digital data sets derives from the analysis of data – importantly though, the analysis of real-time data. Due to this feature of data, i. e. the fact that data is constantly changing, the question that arises as regards access to data in the digital economy relates not so much to access to data as such, but rather to access to the sources of data. After all, it is only in this case that access can be provided to real-time data. In light of this, the current debate on so-called “industrial data” may appear too static and, besides, it considers only part of the data that is relevant for the companies operating in the digital economy. The question is what the legal framework for an optimal allocation of such a digital resource as data should be and whether the question of access can be solved with the currently available legal tools...|$|E
40|$|In {{times of}} digital {{transformation}} and considering {{the potential of}} the <b>data-driven</b> <b>economy,</b> it is crucial that data is not only made available, data sources can be trusted, but also data integrity can be guaranteed, necessary privacy and security mechanisms are in place, and data and access comply with policies and legislation. In many cases, complex and interdisciplinary questions cannot be answered by a single dataset and thus it is necessary to combine data from multiple disparate sources. However, because most data today is locked up in isolated silos, data cannot be used to its fullest potential. The core challenge for most organisations and enterprises in regards to data exchange and integration {{is to be able to}} combine data from internal and external data sources in a manner that supports both day to day operations and innovation. Linked Data is a promising data publishing and integration paradigm that builds upon standard web technologies. It supports the publishing of structured data in a semantically explicit and interlinked manner such that it can be easily connected, and consequently becomes more interoperable and useful. The PROPEL project - Propelling the Potential of Enterprise Linked Data in Austria - surveyed technological challenges, entrepreneurial opportunities, and open research questions on the use of Linked Data in a business context and developed a roadmap and a set of recommendations for policy makers, industry, and the research community. Shifting away from a predominantly academic perspective and an exclusive focus on open data, the project looked at Linked Data as an emerging disruptive technology that enables efficient enterprise data management in the rising data economy. Current market forces provide many opportunities, but also present several data and information management challenges. Given that Linked Data enables advanced analytics and decision-making, it is particularly suitable for addressing today's data and information management challenges. In our research, we identified a variety of highly promising use cases for Linked Data in an enterprise context. Examples of promising application domains include "customization and customer relationship management", "automatic and dynamic content production, adaption and display", "data search, information retrieval and knowledge discovery", as well as "data and information exchange and integration". The analysis also revealed broad potential across a large spectrum of industries whose structural and technological characteristics align well with Linked Data characteristics and principles: energy, retail, finance and insurance, government, health, transport and logistics, telecommunications, media, tourism, engineering, and research and development rank among the most promising industries for the adoption of Linked Data principles. In addition to approaching the subject from an industry perspective, we also examined the topics and trends emerging from the research community in the field of Linked Data and the Semantic Web. Although our analysis revolved around a vibrant and active community composed of academia and leading companies involved in semantic technologies, we found that industry needs and research discussions are somewhat misaligned. Whereas some foundation technologies such as knowledge representation and data creation/publishing/sharing, data management and system engineering are highly represented in scientific papers, specific topics such as recommendations, or cross-topics such as machine learning or privacy and security are marginally present. Topics such as big/large data and the internet of things are (still) on an upward trajectory in terms of attention. In contrast, topics that are very relevant for industry such as application oriented topics or those that relate to security, privacy and robustness are not attracting much attention. When it comes to standardisation efforts, we identified a clear need for a more in-depth analysis into the effectiveness of existing standards, the degree of coverage they provide with respect the foundations they belong to, and the suitability of alternative standards that do not fall under the core Semantic Web umbrella. Taking into consideration market forces, sector analysis of Linked Data potential, demand side analysis and the current technological status it is clear that Linked Data has a lot of potential for enterprises and can act as a key driver of technological, organizational, and economic change. However, in order to ensure a solid foundation for Enterprise Linked Data include there is a need for: greater awareness surrounding the potential of Linked Data in enterprises, lowering of entrance barriers via education and training, better alignment between industry demands and research activities, greater support for technology transfer from universities to companies. The PROPEL roadmap recommends concrete measures in order to propel the adoption of Linked Data in Austrian enterprises. These measures are structured around five fields of activities: "awareness and education", "technological innovation, research gaps, standardisation", "policy and legal", and "funding". Key short-term recommendations include the clustering of existing activities in order to raise visibility on an international level, the funding of key topics that are under represented by the community, and the setup of joint projects. In the medium term, we recommend the strengthening of existing academic and private education efforts via certification and to establish flagship projects that are based on national use cases that can serve as blueprints for transnational initiatives. This requires not only financial support, but also infrastructure support, such as data and services to build solutions on top. In the long term, we recommend cooperation with international funding schemes to establish and foster a European level agenda, and the setup of centres of excellence...|$|E
