5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as <b>electrocution.</b> <b>Electrocution</b> is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

5|$|Bomar was warden of Tennessee State Prison from 1955 {{until his}} death. He oversaw the {{execution}} of several men including William Tines, an African American convicted of raping a 45-year-old white woman, who was executed in the electric chair. Tines was the last man executed by <b>electrocution</b> in Tennessee, and the last person executed until Robert Glen Coe in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{with safety}} when using {{electrical}} appliances, {{and no doubt}} drawing on her own experience in receiving an accidental electric shock that knocked her out for an hour, McKenzie delivered at least one talk on resuscitation, advising that conventional resuscitation should proceed for up to thee-quarters of an hour following <b>electrocution.</b> She knew of one case where recovery took 4 hours.|$|E
5|$|Despite massive {{flooding}} and damage to entire neighborhoods, {{there were no}} drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from <b>electrocution,</b> and 1 in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2billion (2001USD, $6billion 2007USD) throughout Texas.|$|E

5|$|September 5, 1950– Hurricane Easy moves ashore near Cedar Key {{and later}} near Tampa Bay {{as a major}} {{hurricane}} after looping offshore. The hurricane causes locally heavy damage in a sparsely populated area, totaling $3.3million (1950USD, $29.5million 2008USD). Due to its erratic motion, Easy drops heavy rainfall peaking at 38.7inches (983mm) in Yankeetown, which in turn causes 2indirect deaths from <b>electrocution.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Christine had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression {{by the time}} it passed through the Leeward Islands, heavy rains from the storm, peaking at , caused flooding in Puerto Rico. Over 600 homes were flooded and dozens of families had to be evacuated from several towns. One person died from <b>electrocution</b> after stepping on a downed wire on a flooded street. Minor damage was recorded in the Virgin Islands, mainly downed power lines which left roughly 500 people without telephone service.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or <b>electrocution</b> when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E
5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or <b>electrocution</b> hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E

5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently passed in the neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making <b>electrocution</b> the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E
5|$|The first Philippine provinces to be {{impacted}} by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds tore down power lines. One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being electrocuted by a felled power line. In order to prevent more widespread outages, electrical service in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol in Aurora killed 25people. On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, <b>electrocution,</b> or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Irene damaged more than 471,000acres (1,900km²) of sugar cane and 39,000acres (158km²) of banana plantations. Irene's rainfall also flooded tobacco fields. Throughout the country, Irene's rainfall damaged 27,336houses and caused the total loss of 730. 13hospitals were also affected to some extent. 154sectors of Havana lost power {{due to the}} storm. In all, four people {{were killed by the}} storm in Cuba, two of whom in Havana due to <b>electrocution.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{electric}} chair has declined as legislators sought what they believed to be more humane methods of execution. Lethal injection became {{the most widely used}} method, aided by media reports of botched <b>electrocutions</b> in the early 1980s.|$|R

5|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{evacuated}} from northern {{areas of the}} Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was shut off prior to the storm {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>electrocution.</b> Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due to rough seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster agencies were put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped.|$|E
5|$|After peaking, Hary {{weakened}} due to land interaction, and {{it struck}} Madagascar southeast of Antalaha. After turning south over land, Cyclone Hary quickly moved offshore. There were three {{deaths in the}} country, {{one of which was}} from <b>electrocution.</b> There was locally heavy crop damage, and four bridges were destroyed. However, the damage was considered minimal, given the intensity of the storm. After affecting Madagascar, Hary accelerated to the southeast, and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion. On the mountain peaks of the island, rainfall reached , although it was much less near the coast. The rainfall caused flooding, killing one person, and 20,000people were left without power. Hary became extratropical on March13, although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid-latitude storm.|$|E
5|$|Because Roger {{unfortunately}} {{appears at}} every {{scene of crime}} just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by <b>electrocution.</b> By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E
25|$|After 1966, <b>electrocutions</b> ceased {{for a time}} in the United States, but {{the method}} {{continued}} in the Philippines. A well-publicized triple execution took place in May 1972, when Jaime Jose, Basilio Pineda and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and gang-rape of the young actress Maggie dela Riva.|$|R
50|$|As of August 2008, sixteen American {{troops have}} died from {{accidental}} <b>electrocutions</b> in Iraq according to the Defense Department. One soldier had been electrocuted in a shower, while another had been electrocuted in a swimming pool. KBR, the contractor responsible, had been warned by employees of unsafe practices, and was criticised following the revelations.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{the method}} used was changed to the {{electric}} chair. The electric chair was constructed from the wood that had previously made up the state gallows.
