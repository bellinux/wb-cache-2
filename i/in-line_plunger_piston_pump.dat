Ni/MoS 2 composite coatings with different content of MoS 2 were produced {{on the surface}} of 1045 steel by laser cladding technology. SEM and EPMA were used to analyze the microstructures and micro area compositions of the coatings. Dry friction and wear properties of the coatings were tested by friction and wear tester. The results indicate that the microstructures of Ni/MoS 2 composite coating are large quantities of different-form white silicides and black sulfides distributing on the substrate. The sulfides mainly consist of CrxSy, MoS 2 and FeS. When the content of MoS 2 is 9 %, Ni/MoS 2 composite coating exhibits best tribological properties.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} performance curves for a variety of positive displacement pumps in order to select an efficient and low cost option for use as a boiler feed pump in a 1 -kWe organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system built by the Solar Turbine Group in Lesotho. The pumps tested included OEM <b>plunger</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>pumps,</b> and rotary vane-type power steering pumps purchased from a junk yard. Motor speed and torque were measured at different flow rates to determine the power consumed to move fluid in the prescribed pressure regime. The test station was designed to pump deionized water; it was intended that measurements and calculations would then be non-dimensionalized and used to predict the ORC working fluid's properties. Unfortunately, deionized water caused the power steering pump shafts to seize; the efficiencies were below anticipated and the pumps were unable to operate under the specified pressures. It was discovered, after WD- 40 was added to the water, that power steering pumps performed best when moving fluids with more lubricity. The optimal pump was selected based on how the pump efficiency affected the overall ORC system efficiency, defined as the electrical work output divided by the heat input, and the net electric power output. Power steering pumps achieved efficiencies between 34 %- 54 % under the desired ORC operating conditions with water-oil emulsion as the working fluid. For that pump efficiency range, the overall solar thermal electric ORC system efficiency would be 7. 4 %- 8. 5 % and the overall system cost would be USD 4. 59 - 5. 27 per installed Watt. Made specifically for pumping hydroflurorcarbons, the working fluid used in STG's ORC, the OEM Dynex pump exhibited poorer performance than predicted. The pump efficiency of 31 % gave a system efficiency of 7. 1 % and a cost of USD 6. 40 per installed Watt. The OEM water <b>piston</b> and <b>plunger</b> <b>pumps</b> made by Hypro achieved efficiencies of 70 % and 81 %, respectively, under the same ORC operating conditions described above. (cont) For those pump efficiencies, the overall system efficiencies would be 9. 0 % and 9. 2 % and the costs would be USD 4. 58 and 4. 63 per installed Watt, respectively. The most optimal pump is the HyproPiston pump; although it costs nearly six times that of a power steering pump, the overall system cost is lower when normalized over the power output. by Cynthia Lin.

40|$|As water {{hydraulics}} is {{more and}} more highlighted in wide applications, many varieties of research on design, materials and manufacturing methods of water hydraulic components have been carried out. Especially, water hydraulic <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> used to be the subject of study in relation to its relative sliding movement.

In order to reduce the leakage and friction, the relative sliding parts are filled up nearly by using engineering plastic as an anti-wear material on sliding parts.

The developed model is expressed by a set of highly nonlinear mathematical equations, these equations being functions of pump parameters and operating conditions.
