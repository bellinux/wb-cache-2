25|$|Six U.S. states (Hawaii, North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah) {{allow the}} {{possibility}} of the tort action of alienation of affections (brought by a <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse</b> against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage). In a highly publicized case in 2010, a woman in North Carolina won a $9 million suit against her husband's mistress.|$|E
2500|$|All {{countries}} in Europe, {{as well as}} most {{countries in}} Latin America have decriminalized adultery, however in many countries in Africa and Asia (particularly the Middle East) this type of infidelity is criminalized. (see Adultery laws) Even where infidelity is not a criminal offense, it may have legal implications in divorce cases, for example it may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. In civil claims, not only the spouse, but also the [...] "other man/other woman" [...] may be held accountable: for example, seven US states (Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah) allow the possibility of the tort action of alienation of affections (brought by a <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse</b> against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage). In a highly publicized case in 2010, a woman in North Carolina won a $9 million suit against her husband's mistress. In the United States, criminal laws relating to infidelity vary, and those states that criminalise adultery rarely prosecute the offence. Penalties for adultery range from life imprisonment in Michigan, to a ten dollar fine in Maryland or [...] "Class 1" [...] felony in Wisconsin. The constitutionality of US criminal laws on adultery is unclear due to Supreme Court decisions in 1965 giving privacy of sexual intimacy to consenting adults, as well as broader implications of Lawrence v. Texas (2003). Adultery is declared to be illegal by the laws of 21 states.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to breach of promise, a tort {{involving}} a broken engagement against the betrothed, and alienation of affection, a tort action brought by a <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse</b> against a third party.|$|E

50|$|Daughter of Jean de Ludres and Claude de Salles and {{introduced}} {{at the court}} of Lorraine in Poussay. In 1662, she was engaged to Duke Charles IV of Lorraine, who had been banned by the Pope for <b>deserting</b> his <b>spouse</b> Nicolette of Lorraine for Beatrice de Cousance, but the engagement was broken when he married Marie Louise d'Aspremont (1651-1693) in 1664. She became a lady-in-waiting to the French queen Maria Theresa of Spain in 1670 and to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate in 1673. In 1675, she became involved {{in a relationship with}} Louis XIV. Louis wished the relationship to be secret and had no plans to make her official favorite, and when she openly declared {{that she was going to}} replace Madame de Montespan the relationship was ended by Louis. Ludres left the court in 1678 and moved to a convent in Paris. She eventually accepted a royal pension and move back to Lorraine. She was made marquise in 1720.|$|R
25|$|In common-law countries, {{adultery}} {{was also}} known as criminal conversation. This became {{the name of the}} civil tort arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury. Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as crim. con., and was abolished in England in 1857, and the Republic of Ireland in 1976. Another tort, alienation of affection, arises when one <b>spouse</b> <b>deserts</b> the other for a third person. This act was {{also known as}} desertion, which was often a crime as well. A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection. In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Ecclesiastical Courts, which controlled marriage regulations, desertion was not defined as a matrimonial offense, instead a <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse</b> could ask fora decree of restitution of conjugal rights. After such a decree was obtained, the other spouse had to return home and continue marital cohabitation - failure to do so was punished with excommunication.|$|E

50|$|Alienation of {{affections}} is {{a common}} law tort, abolished in many jurisdictions. Where it still exists, an action is brought by a <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse</b> against a third party alleged {{to be responsible for}} the failure of the marriage. The defendant in an alienation of affections suit is typically an adulterous spouse's lover, although family members, counselors and therapists or clergy members who have advised a spouse to seek divorce have also been sued for alienation of affections. As of 2016, six US states (Hawaii, North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah) recognize this tort.|$|E
50|$|While the Pandavas {{were in the}} Kamyaka forest, {{they often}} went hunting, leaving Draupadi alone. At this time Jayadratha, the son of Vriddhakshatra and the husband of Duryodhana's sister Dussala, passed through Kamyaka forest {{on the way to}} Salwa Desa. Jayadratha met Draupadi and then started beseeching her to go away with him and desert her husbands. Draupadi pointed out the immorality of <b>deserting</b> one's <b>spouses</b> when they were in difficulty, and {{attempted}} to stall and dissuade Jayadradtha by describing how the Pandavas would punish him. Failing with words, Jayadratha forced her onto his chariot. Meanwhile, the Pandavas finished their hunt and found Draupadi missing. Learning of their wife's abduction by Jayadratha they rushed to save her. On seeing the Pandavas coming after him, Jayadratha left Draupadi on the road, though ultimately the Pandavas managed to arrest him. Yudhishthira urged Bhima to spare Jayadratha's life for the sake of Dussala and Gandhari, much to the indignation of Draupadi. In some versions of the story, Yudhishthira asks Draupadi to pass the sentence since it was she who was attacked, and she begrudgingly counsels to spare him because of the relations they share. Before freeing him, the Pandavas shaved Jayadratha's head at five places in order to publicly humiliate him.|$|R
5000|$|The Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) {{provided}} additional {{procedures for}} the <b>deserted</b> <b>spouse.</b> URESA applied both to the enforcement of support orders and to original claims for support. Its procedures enabled the claimant to file in the local forum, which forwarded the complaint to the state where the defendant was present. The court of the second state then exercised personal jurisdiction over the defendant and entered the appropriate support order. Particularly important was the act's choice-of-law provision stating that the support obligation was to be determined {{according to the law}} of the state where the defendant was present at and during the time for which support is claimed.|$|E
