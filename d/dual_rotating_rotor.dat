To achieve a high accuracy measurement two approaches of an intensity detector and analysis algorism of a Stokes parameter were proposed.

40|$|For next {{generation}} aircraft, contra <b>rotating</b> open <b>rotor</b> propulsion systems are currently discussed. Their economic advantages are {{in conflict with}} their high noise emission, which concentrates in distinct frequency bands. To bring contra <b>rotating</b> open <b>rotor</b> engines into operation at commercial aircraft and to maintain the passenger comfort level, active systems for noise reduction are consi-dered. In this article, a contra <b>rotating</b> open <b>rotor</b> noise simulator for the future testing of active systems is presented.

Tests were made with a rotor having an inlet tip diameter of 2. 18 inches and a ratio of hub radius to tip radius of 0. 52, in conjunction with a conical inlet having a 25 deg semi-vertex cone angle, at a Mach number of 2. 1 over an angle-of-attack range of 0 deg to 8 deg. A simplified analysis showing that a supersonic, freely <b>rotating</b> <b>rotor</b> with maximum solidity for noninterference between blades will operate in an undistorted flow with a total-pressure defect of 1 percent or less was experimentally verified. Overall total-pressure distortions of 0. 1 to 0. 4 and Mach number distortions of 0. 4 to 1. 4, obtained at 4 deg to 8 deg angle of attack, were reduced about 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively, {{because of the presence of}} the rotor, with no measurable total-pressure loss. The rotor increased the peak total-pressure recovery at the simulated combustion chamber 1 1 / 2 and 3 1 / 2 percent at 6 deg and 8 deg angles of attack, respectively. This increase is attributed to lower diffusion duct losses as a consequence of a more uniform flow created by the rotor...|$|R
