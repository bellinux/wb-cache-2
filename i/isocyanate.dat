5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl <b>isocyanate</b> leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl <b>isocyanate,</b> and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, {{visits the}} plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two {{additional}} tanks for storage of methyl <b>isocyanate</b> to increase {{the output of the}} plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter in the Paris Match, and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl <b>isocyanate</b> as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E
30|$|This {{article is}} a review of <b>isocyanates</b> present in common {{material}} found in buildings such as PU insulation and upholstery furniture foam {{as well as the}} generation of <b>isocyanates</b> during thermal degradation of these materials. The first part of this review discusses the reactivity and commercial applications of <b>isocyanates</b> and the thermal degradation of materials generating airborne <b>isocyanates.</b> The second part summarizes toxicological findings from both high, acute doses as well as chronic low doses after exposure to airborne <b>isocyanates.</b> This part also includes a comprehensive overview of legislation for airborne <b>isocyanates</b> and a discussion of human exposure. The third part of this review discusses the generation of <b>isocyanates</b> in fire effluents by bench-scale and large-scale fire tests, different sampling techniques and agents for derivatisation airborne <b>isocyanates</b> and detection techniques. This is to the authors’ knowledge the first time a review about the sampling, analysis and toxicity of <b>isocyanates</b> generated from fires have been made.|$|R
30|$|The most well studied {{materials}} for the generation of <b>isocyanates</b> during thermal degradation of materials are PUR and PIR foams. There are currently significant data gaps in the {{knowledge of how to}} sample and quantitate <b>isocyanates</b> from fire effluents. Despite the complexity of determining <b>isocyanates</b> in fire effluents, recent advances in both sampling as well as analytical techniques have contributed significantly to optimising these methods. The most common sampling method for <b>isocyanates</b> generated from fires is an impinger-filter sampling technique using DBA as derivatisation agent. Due to the favourable reaction kinetics, this method is suitable for quantitative analysis. Sampled <b>isocyanates</b> are generally analysed by HPLC coupled to either UV/FL or MS detectors. Although the selectivity is described as good for <b>isocyanates</b> sampled in air by HPLC-UV/FL, MS/MS detectors are to prefer when analysing more complex matrices, such as fire effluents, due to better selectivity and sensitivity, especially when internal standards are used. Continuous improvements in investigating the generation of <b>isocyanates</b> from thermal degradation of materials as well as sampling and analysis are expected in the future.|$|R
50|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{also can}} react with themselves. Aliphatic di-isocyanates can form trimers, which are {{structurally}} related to cyanuric acid. <b>Isocyanates</b> participate in Diels-Alder reactions, functioning as dienophiles.|$|R
25|$|Ureas in {{the more}} general sense can be {{accessed}} in the laboratory by reaction of phosgene with primary or secondary amines, proceeding through an <b>isocyanate</b> intermediate. Non-symmetric ureas can be accessed by reaction of primary or secondary amines with an <b>isocyanate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{positions}} of the <b>isocyanate</b> groups influences their reactivity. In 4,4'-MDI, the two <b>isocyanate</b> groups are equivalent but in 2,4'-MDI the two groups display highly differing reactivities. The group at the 4-position is approximately four times more reactive than the group at the 2-position due to steric hindrance.|$|E

25|$|Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic <b>isocyanates</b> {{are used}} in smaller quantities, most often in {{coatings}} and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic <b>isocyanates</b> tend to darken on exposure to light. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic <b>isocyanates</b> are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).|$|R
5000|$|MDI is {{the least}} {{hazardous}} of the commonly available <b>isocyanates</b> but is not benign. [...] Its very low vapour pressure reduces its hazards during handling {{compared to the other}} major <b>isocyanates</b> (TDI, HDI). However, it, like the other <b>isocyanates,</b> is an allergen and sensitizer. Persons developing sensitivity to <b>isocyanates</b> may have dangerous systemic reactions to extremely small exposures, including respiratory failure. Handling MDI requires strict engineering controls and personal protective equipment. Compared to other organic cyanates, MDI has a relatively low human toxicity. It is a potentially violently reactive material towards water and other nucleophiles.|$|R
40|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{are used}} for the large scale {{production}} of polyurethane polymers, which have an almost endless variety of applications {{in the manufacture of}} flexible and rigid foams, elastomers, adhesives, and surface coatings. Acute or chronic exposure to high concentrations of <b>isocyanates</b> can result in respiratory health hazards through a direct irritant effect. <b>Isocyanates</b> are of special interest, however, because, in some exposed workers, they can cause occupational asthma or extrinsic alveolitis through an apparently sensitising mechanism. Because of their wide industrial use, <b>isocyanates</b> are the principal cause of occupational asthma which is now the most common respiratory disease linked to the working environment. This review focuses on recently studied aspects of occupational asthma and extrinsic alveolitis related to exposure to <b>isocyanates...</b>|$|R

25|$|Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> {{is usually}} {{manufactured}} by {{the reaction of}} monomethylamine and phosgene. For large scale production, it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl <b>isocyanate</b> and two moles of hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas.|$|E
25|$|Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> (MIC) is {{extremely}} toxic. The {{threshold limit value}} set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl <b>isocyanate</b> cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl <b>isocyanate</b> in air).|$|E
25|$|Liquid resin blends and <b>isocyanates</b> {{may contain}} {{hazardous}} or regulated components. <b>Isocyanates</b> are known skin and respiratory sensitizers. Additionally, amines, glycols, and phosphate present in spray polyurethane foams present risks.|$|R
25|$|The great {{majority}} of phosgene {{is used in the}} production of <b>isocyanates,</b> the most important being toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). These two <b>isocyanates</b> are precursors to polyurethanes.|$|R

25|$|A third reaction, {{particularly}} important in making insulating rigid foams is the <b>isocyanate</b> trimerization reaction, which is catalyzed by potassium octoate, for example.|$|E
25|$|Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> (MIC) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the molecular formula CH3NCO. Synonyms are isocyanatomethane, methyl carbylamine and MIC. Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> is an intermediate chemical {{in the production}} of carbamate pesticides (such as carbaryl, carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used {{in the production of}} rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is extremely hazardous to human health. It was the principal toxicant involved in the Bhopal disaster, which killed nearly 2,259 people initially and officially 3,787 people in total.|$|E
25|$|The methyl <b>isocyanate</b> is {{obtained}} by treating the MCC with a tertiary amine, such as N,N-dimethylaniline, or with pyridine or by separating it by using distillation techniques.|$|E
40|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> are {{important}} in industrial hygiene and workplace monitoring. Owing to their severe acute toxicity and sensitizing properties, analytical methods with high sampling efficiency and sensitivity in the low ppb to ppt range are required. The reactivity of <b>isocyanates</b> necessitates initial derivatization with nucleophilic agents—usually amines—for stabilization and enrichment; this is often followed by chromatographic separation with spectroscopic, electrochemical, or mass spectrometric detection. Sampling strategies for airborne <b>isocyanates</b> comprise active, i. e. pumped, or passive, i. e. diffusive, methods; the method selected depends on the application. Whereas active methods rely mainly on impingers, reagent-coated filters, or sampling tubes, passive samplers make use of reagent-coated filters, the surface of which {{is connected to the}} air sample by diffusion channels. Because airborne <b>isocyanates</b> are prone to occur in different forms, i. e. as vapors, as aerosols, or adsorbed on particulate matter, denuder sampling has been introduced, thus enabling simultaneous collection of gaseous and aerosol <b>isocyanates.</b> The first part of this review summarizes chemical methods and reagents which have been introduced for derivatization of airborne <b>isocyanates.</b> The advantages and drawbacks of the individual derivatization procedures and their combination with different detection principles are evaluated. In the second part, the most recent developments in air sampling for <b>isocyanates,</b> with special focus on diffusive sampling, are reviewed and critically discussed...|$|R
30|$|In a {{study by}} Hertzberg et al. (Hertzberg et al. 2003) {{airborne}} <b>isocyanates</b> from 23 common materials found in buildings were sampled after being generated by a cone calorimeter. The airborne <b>isocyanates</b> were collected by impinger-filter and were derivatised by DBA (Hertzberg et al. 2003). The main findings from these initial small scale tests were that all nitrogen-containing materials {{included in the study}} produced <b>isocyanates</b> upon thermal degradation (Hertzberg et al. 2003). Airborne <b>isocyanates</b> were also sampled from a ISO 9705 using a sofa containing PUF (Hertzberg et al. 2003). The experiment went to flash over, meaning that the combustion occurred during under-ventilated conditions (Hertzberg et al. 2003). The relatively high amounts of <b>isocyanates</b> measured, mainly ICA, but also MIC, PHI and 2, 4 -TDI, from this test were considered a potential health hazard (Hertzberg et al. 2003).|$|R
30|$|Fent et al. (Fent & Evans 2011) used a denuder {{system with}} dibutyl amine (DBA) coated filters {{attached}} to fire fighters to sample <b>isocyanates</b> generated from vehicle fires. The main conclusion {{from this study}} was that passenger compartment fires produced detectable levels of airborne <b>isocyanates</b> originating for the foams used for the seats (Fent & Evans 2011). No <b>isocyanates</b> were detected in samples from engine fires where foams were absent (Fent & Evans 2011).|$|R
25|$|Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> is also {{manufactured}} from N-methylformamide and air. In {{the latter}} process, it is immediately consumed in a closed-loop process to make methomyl. Other manufacturing {{methods have been}} reported.|$|E
25|$|Methyl <b>isocyanate</b> (MIC) is a colorless, poisonous, lachrymatory (tearing agent), {{flammable}} liquid. It is soluble {{in water}} to 6–10 parts per 100 parts, but it also reacts with water (see Reactions below).|$|E
25|$|Polyurethanes are {{produced}} by mixing two or more liquid streams. The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, blowing agents and so on. The two components {{are referred to as}} a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The <b>isocyanate</b> is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'. This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'. In Europe the meanings for 'A-side' and 'B-side' are reversed. Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, blowing agents, pigments, and fillers. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the <b>isocyanate,</b> polyol or additives.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} outcome of {{occupational}} asthma (OA) induced by <b>isocyanates</b> in Ontario (where a surveillance programme for exposed workers {{has been in place}} for over 15 years), with {{the outcome of}} OA induced by other work agents. METHODS: Compensated OA claims during the period 1984 - 88 in Ontario were retrospectively reviewed in a standardised way. RESULTS: 136 / 235 compensated claims were attributed to <b>isocyanates.</b> Compared with other causes of OA, those attributed to <b>isocyanates</b> had a shorter latent period before onset (5. 9 v 7. 9 years, P < 0. 05), shorter duration of symptoms before diagnosis (2. 0 v 3. 0 years, P < 0. 05), and less associated atopy (43 % v 58 %, P < 0. 05). Outcome at a mean of 1. 9 years after initial assessment was significantly better in those with OA induced by isocyanates; 73 % cleared or improved v 56 % with other causes of OA (P < 0. 05). Ten subjects with OA induced by <b>isocyanates</b> stayed at the same work; none cleared and four had worsened at follow up. A better outcome in OA induced by <b>isocyanates</b> was associated with early diagnosis (P < 0. 05), and early removal from <b>isocyanates</b> after the onset of asthma. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome in the group with OA induced by <b>isocyanates</b> is similar to previous follow up studies. However, it is better than the outcome in our comparison group with OA due to other causes, perhaps because of earlier diagnosis in the group with OA induced by <b>isocyanates.</b> This may be attributable to the medical surveillance of workers exposed to <b>isocyanates</b> in Ontario, either directly from the surveillance assessments, or indirectly by increasing awareness of the condition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{are used}} mainly for {{manufacturing}} of polyurethane (PUR) foams, lacquers, elastomers and glues. The production of PUR exceeds 2 million {{tonnes per year}} and is increasing. Occupational exposure to <b>isocyanates</b> are associated with respiratory disorders. A method based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of <b>isocyanates,</b> aminoisocyanates and amines in air. Sampling was performed in impinger flasks where the <b>isocyanates</b> were derivatised with di-n-butylamine (DBA) and in a subsequent step the amines with ethylchloroformate. The presence of possible interfering compounds {{did not affect the}} results. The method made it possible to qualitatively determine new isocyanate- and amine-containing compounds formed during thermal decomposition of PUR. A method based on 9 -(N-methylaminomethyl) -anthracene impregnated filters was developed which made it possible to sample monomeric <b>isocyanates</b> during a prolonged time. A LC-MS method for the biological monitoring of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate was developed and biomarkers were found in urine hydrolysates among three exposed volunteers. An association between the total excreted amount of biomarkers in hydrolysed urine and the estimated inhaled dose for three concentrations of the <b>isocyanates</b> was seen. The exposure to toluene diisocyanate at a plant producing flexible PUR foam was studied with a continuous air monitoring instrument. The exposure was found to be typically peak wise. Biomarkers in hydrolysed urine and plasma were determined using GC-MS. A relation in time between air levels of <b>isocyanates</b> and biomarkers in urine was seen but no correlation was found between biomarkers in urine and plasma and air concentrations of <b>isocyanates...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Isocyanates</b> {{have a broad}} {{spectrum}} of uses and they are used in the production of many products including polyurethane polymers, coatings, adhesives, paints and foams. While <b>isocyanates</b> are widely studied and well represented in the literature, nitrogen substituted <b>isocyanates</b> are quite rare. Amino and imino-isocyanates are examples of nitrogen substituted <b>isocyanates.</b> Previous work within the group studied the reactivity of these intermediates in the alkene aminocarbonylation reaction, and used hydrazones and hydrazides as precursors of nitrogen substituted <b>isocyanates.</b> From there, a second reaction pathway was studied. This involved the reactivity of hydrazones with nucleophiles to develop a simple exchange reaction. In this work, the substitution reactivity involving imino-isocyanates will be presented. This will include the scope of nucleophiles and hydrazones as well as a discussion on the formation of the imino-isocyanates. This reactivity allows for the facile formation of a variety of hydrazones with the flexibility to start from common hydrazone precursors...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods for}} air sampling and determination of <b>isocyanates,</b> amines, aminoisocyanates and anhydrides. These organic compounds are generated during thermal {{degradation of polymers}} such as polyurethane (PUR) or epoxy. <b>Isocyanates,</b> amines and anhydrides are airway irritants known to cause occupational asthma. Some of the compounds are listed as human carcinogens. Many workers are exposed. <b>Isocyanates</b> and anhydrides are reactive {{and needs to be}} immediately derivatized during sampling. Methods have been developed for determination of airborne <b>isocyanates,</b> aminoisocyanates and anhydrides using di-n-butylamine (DBA) as reagent to form stabile urea derivatives or amide derivatives. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabled detection limits as low as 10 attomoles. A nitrogen-selective LC-detector enabled quantification of DBA-derivatives in reference solutions. A novel sampler is presented. The sampler consists of a denuder in series with a three-stage cascade impactor and an end filter. The sampler made it possible to reveal the distribution of <b>isocyanates</b> between gas and different particle size fractions. During thermal degradation of PUR, <b>isocyanates</b> were associated to particle size fractions (< 1 µm) that may penetrate to the lower airways. The distribution during 8 minutes changes noticeably. Aromatic <b>isocyanates</b> become associated to small particles (< 1 µm). As a reference method, air-sampling was performed using an impinger filled with di-n-butylamine (DBA) in toluene, connected in series with a glass fiber filter. There was a good agreement between the denuder-impactor sampler and the reference method...|$|R
