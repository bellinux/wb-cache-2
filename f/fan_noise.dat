25|$|The Orange Bowl {{was also}} {{the site of the}} NCAA's longest college {{football}} home field winning streak. Between 1985 and 1994, the Miami Hurricanes won 58 straight home games at the Bowl, until ended by the Washington Huskies. The stadium's home field advantage used to include a steel structure that fans would set to rumbling by stomping their feet. Concrete reinforcement had silenced the rumble. There was still the advantage of the West End Zone, which had a relatively narrow radius that amplified <b>fan</b> <b>noise.</b> The West End Zone was a factor in the Wide Right curse, in which the Florida State Seminoles lost a series of close games due to missed field goals.

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of any system {{depends on the}} definition of the boundaries of the system. For an electrical energy customer the {{efficiency of}} electric space heating is almost 100% because almost all purchased energy is converted to building heat (the only exception being <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> and indication lights which demand very little electricity and virtually none at all when compared to the extremely large energy draw of the heating itself). However, if a power plant supplying electricity is included, the overall efficiency drops drastically. For example, a fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Even though the electric heater is 100% efficient, the amount of fuel needed to produce electric heat is more than if the fuel was burned in a furnace or boiler at the building being heated. If the same fuel could be used for space heating by a consumer, it would be more efficient overall to burn the fuel at the end user's building. On the other hand, replacing electric heating with fossil fuel burning heaters, isn't necessary good as it removes the ability to have renewable electric heating, this can be achieved by sourcing the electricity from a renewable source.|$|E
2500|$|Another odd {{feature of}} the Selectric {{terminals}} was the [...] "keyboard lock" [...] mechanism. [...] If the computer system a user was communicating with {{was too busy to}} accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and computer output in a confusing manner. [...] Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an unexpected keyboard lock activation could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. [...] There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> in many computer facilities.

2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of <b>fan</b> <b>noise.</b> During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place you could see the game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to obtain {{numerical}} data for <b>fan</b> tone <b>noise</b> propagation and reducing the load from blade-tower interaction. By using a CFD code, MB 3 D, which is supplied by Professor Li He, <b>fan</b> tone <b>noise</b> transmission and wind turbine blade-tower interaction are simulated and analysed. CFD application on turbomachinery unsteady flow is introduced and the two issues, <b>fan</b> tone <b>noise</b> and wind turbine have been reviewed. The CFD code to simulate the two different problems is introduced and its computational methodology is described. By using CFD method, the sound wave transmission in cut-on and cut-off situations are simulated and analysed. The results show that when the disturbance frequency is above the cut-off frequency, the pressure wave can propagate along the duct, when the disturbance frequency is below the cut-off frequency, the pressure wave will decay along the duct. The different decay rates depend on different cut off ratio. The mesh dependency of the computational simulations has been examined. Wind turbine blade-tower interaction is also simulated by using MB 3 D code. Adaptively pitching blade is introduced {{in order to minimize}} this interaction. The results show that with pitching blade by half degree or so, the unsteady forces on the blade can be at least halved, which can correspondingly reduce the bending moment (hence increase the fatigue life span), and improve the average power output.

50|$|Fans {{installed}} in a PC case can produce noise levels of up to 70 dB. Since <b>fan</b> <b>noise</b> increases with the fifth power of the fan rotation speed, reducing rotations per minute (RPM) by a small amount potentially means a large reduction in <b>fan</b> <b>noise.</b> This must be done cautiously, as excessive reduction in speed may cause components to overheat and be damaged.
