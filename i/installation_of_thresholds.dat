40|$|Worldwide, but {{subject to}} {{substantial}} variations across countries, housing adaptations and home modifications constitute important and common interventions in occupational therapy practice. Starting {{out from the}} notion that occupational performance is the outcome of person–environment–occupation (P–E–O) transactions, such interventions are applicable {{with all kinds of}} clients with occupational performance problems in the home setting. Housing adaptations entail alterations of permanent physical features in the home and the immediate outdoor environment, whereas home modifications typically are more complex interventions that often include the provision of assistive technology and related training, etc. Most clients are older people, and measures such as removal <b>of</b> <b>thresholds,</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> shower stalls instead <b>of</b> bathtubs, and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> handrails and grab bars are among the most common. A growing body of scientific evidence has the potential to strengthen this part of occupational therapy practice, with the ultimate goal of creating home environments that support occupational performance—and ultimately, health, and quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Base Information Transfer System (BITS) and the Telephone Modernization Plan (TMP) will upgrade the backbone cable plant {{of the telephone}} system on Navy bases. Using a hypothetical Navy base and its existing twisted-pair wire network, this paper analyzes the unique costs of optical fiber and twisted-pair wire for four installation options: immediate <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> optical fiber; time phased <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> optical fiber; time-phased <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> twisted-pair wire in trenches; and time-phased <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> twisted-pair wire in existing conduit. The cost analysis indicates that the lowest cost option is twisted-pair wire installed in conduit. However, the cost-effectiveness analysis concludes that time-phased <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> optical fiber is the best alternative due to its performance characteristics.
