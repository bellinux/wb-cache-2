Each agent is also called specie agent and is responsible {{of a set of}} particles having their fitness values in the same range. This range is called FVR (for fitness value range), and it is the specificity of the specie agent SpecieFVR. The species agents cooperate all by exchanging solutions to reach the optimal one.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{bidirectional}} power {{performance of a}} tidal unit, two designs were investigated. The use of unilateral or <b>double</b> <b>guide</b> vanes in a tubular tidal unit influences {{the performance of the}} hydraulic unit. Based on the N-S equations and the RNG k-ε turbulence model, the SIMPLEC algorithm was used for 3 D steady-state numerical simulation of the entire turbine flow passage with unilateral and <b>double</b> <b>guide</b> vanes. The internal flow condition under positive and reverse power generation conditions was also analyzed. At the same time, the turbine, with a runner 1. 6 m in diameter, was scaled down to 0. 35 m diameter for model tests. The model tests were based on a multifunction hydromechanical test bench at Hohai University. The water head, discharge, and torque of the tubular turbine were, respectively, tested using a pressure difference sensor, electromagnetic flow meter, and torque meter under different guide-vane openings. The results show that turbine efficiency in the model test is slightly lower than that predicted by numerical simulation under the same conditions. However, the difference is not large. With <b>double</b> side <b>guide</b> vanes, although the efficiency of positive power generation decreased, the efficiency of reverse power generation is greatly improved...|$|R

40|$|A Dynamic Distributed <b>Double</b> <b>Guided</b> Genetic Algorithm(D 3 G 2 A) {{is a new}} muti-agent {{approach}} {{which leads}} to additive constraint satisfaction problem. This approach is imspired by the guided genetic algorithm(GGA) and by the dynamic distributed <b>double</b> <b>guided</b> genetic algorithm for Max_CSPs. It consists of agents dynamically created and cooperating in order to solve problem with each agent performing its own GA. Firstly, our approach is enhanced by three parameters, guidance probability(Pguid),local optima detector (LOD), weigh (ε), which allow not only diversification but also escaping from local optima. Secondly, the GGAs performed agents will no longer he the same. This is stirred by the natural laws. In fact, our approach will let the agents able to count their own GA parameters. In order to show D 3 G 2 A advantages, the approach and the GGA are applied to the randomly generated binary constraints satisfaction problems. Compared with the centralized guided genetic algorithm and applied to a of literature known problems, our new approaches have been experimentally shown to be always better in terms of fitness values and CPU time...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} triple channel <b>double</b> ring <b>guided</b> {{treatment of}} lacrimal obstruction and its clinical therapeutic effect. METHODS: Fifty cases(54 eyes) of lacrimal obstruction were treated by laser or micro-drill under triple channel lacrimal endoscope with <b>double</b> ring <b>guided</b> intubation created by our department. The silicone tube was extracted at 3 ～ 6 mo of postoperation. All cases were followed up 3 ～ 6 mo. RESULTS:Of total 54 eyes, 47 eyes were cured, and lacrimal passage was clearly flushed without epiphora; 5 eyes were improved, but lacrimal passage was clearly flushed with slight epiphora; 2 eyes were recurred, and lacrimal passage was not clearly flushed with epiphora. Total effective rate was 96 %. CONCLUSION:Triple channel <b>double</b> ring <b>guided</b> treatment of lacrimal obstruction has greatly improved traditional operation.
