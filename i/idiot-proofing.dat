40|$|Many of our {{concepts}} {{are introduced to}} us via, and seem only to be constrained by, roughand-ready explanations and some sample paradigm positive and negative applications. This happens even in informal logic and mathematics. Yet in some cases, the concepts in question – although only informally and vaguely characterized – in fact have, or appear to have, entirely determinate extensions. Here’s one familiar example. When we start learning computability theory, we are introduced {{to the idea of}} an algorithmically computable function (from numbers to numbers) – i. e. one whose value for any given input can be determined by a step-by-step calculating procedure, where each step is fully determined by some antecedently given finite set of calculating rules. We are told that we are to abstract from practical considerations of how many steps will be needed and how much ink will be spilt in the process, so long as everything remains finite. We are also told that each step is to be ‘small’ and the rules governing it must be ‘simple’, available to a cognitively limited calculating agent: for we want an algorithmic procedure, step-by-minimal-step, to be <b>idiot-proof.</b> For a classic elucidation of this kind, see e. g. Rogers (1967, pp. 1 – 5). Church’s Thesis, i...|$|R

Criticism has also been leveled at Weisinger for quashing creativity by dictating storylines. Jim Shooter, who wrote for years under his editorship, praised Weisinger's [...] "rules" [...] for writing comics but criticized his rigid adherence to them: [...] "[...] [...] Mort’s rules always worked, story-mechanics-wise. Easy, <b>idiot-proof,</b> safe. Trying things that explored the frontiers {{beyond the confines of}} Mort’s rules was tricky—fraught with opportunities to fail—but if you were daring, if you had the necessary depth of understanding and the skills, you could do wonderful things."in original Weisinger has commented, [...] "People have always accused me of being an egomaniac as an editor because I always gave the writers my own plots. I did that for a reason. If I asked a writer to bring in his own plots, and he spent a weekend on four of them, and I didn't like any of the four, then he's wasted a whole weekend[...] [...] [...] [...] The least I could do was to think of a plot for the writer and if he liked it — I'd never force it down his throat — we'd kick it around and evolve a story." ...|$|R
40|$|Meta-analysis is {{considered}} {{the highest level of}} evidence on effectiveness of healthcare interventions. It provides important information by capitalizing on the large numbers of studies performed {{to assess the impact of}} healthcare interventions, helps reduce variability and uncertainty among published reports of efficacy, produce summary estimates of effectiveness for clinical decision making and evaluate the quality of the published evidence. However, a large proportion of meta-analyses pose a surprising challenge for the uninitiated user: in order to figure out what the researchers found, the user must struggle through a maze of textual jargon, statistical formulae and lengthy lists of actual studies and extensive tables of overall average effect size and mean effect sizes for important subgroups of studies. On the premise that "a picture is worth more than a thousand words but a 'metagraphita' is worth more than a thousand words and statistical tests", the purpose of this presentation is to provide an <b>idiot-proof</b> overview of statistical graphics/diagnostic plots for exploration of publication bias, data distribution, heterogeneity and for summarizing overall datasets. Discussion will include the construction and interpretation of general graphical displays such as weighted histograms, normal quantile plots, forest plots, funnel graphs, scatter diagrams, as well as plots unique to diagnostic meta-analysis (e. g. ROC plane graphic, Accuracy-Threshold regression plots, summary receiver operator characteristic curves and likelihood ratio scattergrams). Presentation will consist of didactic slide presentation supplemented by handouts and an annotated bibliography and illustration of derivation and interpretation of visual displays from published meta-analyses using Stata. ...|$|R

40|$|The lie {{detector}} tells {{us more about}} the times than the truthfulness of politicians, according to David Burchell IT’S the very latest in political fashion: the polygraph machine as style accessory. As seen on TV! First the former Defence Department advisor Mike Scrafton bravely donned the black armband and chestbands for the TV cameras, as he repeated his claims about his advice to the PM in November 2001 on the ‘children overboard’ incident. Then, within days, NSW premier Bob Carr volunteered to assume the polygraph position and substantiate his actions {{in relation to a}} controversial Sydney shopping centre development. Who next, you may well ask? For in truth the possibilities are almost endless. Federal treasurers could brave the machine’s metallic hum to swear to their budget costings. State ministers for transport could send the needle aflutter as they testify to the accuracy of their public transport timetables. Ministers for health would resemble the patients under their jurisdiction as they labour to wish away waiting-lists without breaking into a tell-tale sweat. Of course, APO readers of a sober disposition may well regard this little outbreak of levity on my part as being in poor taste. After all, isn’t this all a serious business? Isn’t truth in public life the most important political commodity of them all? And isn’t this little outbreak of computer-assisted candour a sign of how far our standards have fallen? Well, maybe. And yet of course there’s a little glitch in the software here. As a matter of simple fact, polygraph machines don’t actually prove whether or not people are lying. At best (assuming you take the claims of the technology seriously at all) all they prove is that the people subjected to them believe they’re telling the truth. And since any dedicated TV news viewer knows that, given a little time, human beings can persuade themselves of just about anything (I never did take those performance-enhancing drugs, we never had actual sex, I never saw that man’s face before, etc etc), that doesn’t really count for all that much. And so, in large measure, the fad for self-induced lie-detecting {{is little more than a}} political stunt. In the end, those most likely to pass lie-detector tests with flying colours are those with the worst memories, and those with the greatest capacity for personal (as well perhaps as political) self-deception. Persuade yourself - the moral seems to be - and you can persuade the world. All’s not quite lost in the world of political hi-tech, though. For if the polygraph is a rather poor diviner of political Truth, it’s an uncanny means of detecting the political zeitgeist. We’ve been so buffeted by claims of lies, deceit and political skullduggery in Australian public life for two or three years now, many of us probably earnestly desire that an <b>idiot-proof,</b> bug-free, virus-protected and firewalled means of apprehending the real and unvarnished God’s-Own Truth really existed. First, of course, there were the claims (incorrect claims, as is now absolutely clear) that children had been thrown overboard from a leaky boat in October 2001. Because the government very likely became aware that the claims were wrong before the 2001 election, but only ’fessed up after it had won that election, many impassioned journalists and academic commentators adopted the incident as a marker of the triumph of evil in our political life. And it’s been their Priority Number One ever since. This powerful (if sometimes a tad self-righteous) instinct for the defence of truth was thrown into overdrive during the controversy over the government’s asylum-seeker and detention policies that dominated political life throughout 2002. And it shot into the stratosphere in the debate that accompanied our decision to enter the Iraq War in support of the US last year. As a result of these acrimonious and choleric disputes, just about everyone in Australia now has a firmly held view on all of these great and vexed questions. Did the government deliberately lie about the children overboard? Did it lie about conditions in the detention centres? Did it lie about WMDs, or the reasons for going to war in Iraq? Has it been lying since about what it lied about then? (Whether they change votes is another matter. But more of that anon.) And yet, like the polygraph machine itself, this worthy, high-minded and crusading campaign for truth in our public life has been somewhat veridically challenged from the outset. It’s absolutely clear now, in hindsight, that the widespread belief in the existence of Iraqi WMDs before the 2003 war was an egregious and even amateurish error, compounded out of poor intelligence and wishful thinking. And yet not one of the enquiries established in Britain, the US or Australia since then has found a single significant piece of evidence that the governments of any of those countries deliberately confected those beliefs, wrong though they may have been. Again with the benefit of hindsight, the course of the Iraq War and its aftermath looks increasingly like a huge strategic error on the part of the US and its allies. Whatever one thinks of its motivations, or the awfulness of Saddam’s regime, the US invasion was clearly ill-advised and under-provisioned, the post-invasion reconstruction policy was amateurish and inept, and the political calculations were wildly out of kilter with reality. Together, these errors have caused the Iraqi people much unnecessary pain. Mind you, none of these judgements rely upon the truthfulness or otherwise of George W. Bush, Tony Blair or John Howard. Indeed, one could view all of them as basically honourable men, and yet come to the bitter conclusion that they planned and acted in profound error. That, on the face of it, seemed to be the view of the forty-plus retired military commanders and diplomats who penned their open letter to a national newspaper recently. Yet time and again when individuals among them were interviewed by the media, they felt compelled to lard their criticisms of the government’s policy with the familiar dark claims of lies and deception. Indeed, so deeply intertwined have opposition to the war and the rhetoric of lies and deception become, that thousands of intelligent and well-meaning individuals have lined up at cinema entrances to see and hear the ‘truth’ on Iraq told by a reality-TV vaudeville clown with all the political credibility of the One Nation party. That’s why the polygraph machine is the perfect symbol of our political condition. If you’re caught up enough in the passion of the moment, in the hatred of bloodshed or the incarceration of those you regard as innocents, the minutiae of fact and error hardly count. Like the self-deceiving subject of the lie-detector test, you’ll pass your own test of truthfulness with flying colours. You’ll just know your leaders are lying, and your conviction will carry conviction - at least to yourself. The small problem with this view is that the lie-detector’s view of the world is largely a political irrelevence. Most Australians made up their minds long ago what they thought about the Tampa, ‘children overboard’ and the Iraq War. And the never-ending barrage of claims and counter-claims of lies and deception are pretty much water off the duck’s back now. What’s worse for Mr Scrafton, the generals, Michael Moore and the rest is that accusations of lying are a decidedly inflation-prone currency. The more often you accuse others of spreading mistruths (and they make counter-accusations against you), the less likely people are to believe what any of you is saying, either on the question at issue or any other. ‘They’re all a bunch of liars’, they’ll say - and they’ll sadly turn off the TV and walk away. And that’s a pity. Because from the point of view of Australia’s future there are great issues to be decided in this election - issues that affect the lives of ordinary struggling families, people under stress and strain, or simply submerging under the waves of financial trouble. And none of these issues relies upon painting your opponent as the devil incarnate. David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney and is associate editor of AP...|$|R
