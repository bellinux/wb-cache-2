It is thanks to the leadership of Mavis Moyo, the eager persistence of her and some of her colleagues at ZBC Radio 4, carried on and further by FAMWZ members through persistent outreach training, as much as the very eagerness of the rural women groups themselves, that radio listening clubs could be established all over the country.Support from UNESCO and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation helped to run and maintain the project,which had the backing of the Ministries of <b>Information,</b> <b>Post</b> and Telecommunications, and Community- and Cooperative Development and Women's Affairs.|$|E
