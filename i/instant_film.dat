500|$|The song's {{breakdown}} {{coined the}} phrase [...] "shake {{it like a}} Polaroid picture", a reference to an erroneous technique used by some photographers to expedite <b>instant</b> <b>film.</b> Early versions of the film needed to be dried, and shaking the picture helped it to dry faster. The breakdown also namechecks singer Beyoncé and actress Lucy Liu. The song closes by repeating the chorus and gradually fading out.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, it was {{claimed that}} Chicago {{resident}} Ted Serios, a hotel bellhop by trade {{who was then}} in his late forties, used psychokinetic powers to produce images on Polaroid <b>instant</b> <b>film.</b> Serios's psychic claims were bolstered by the endorsement of a Denver-based psychiatrist, Jule Eisenbud (1908–1999), who {{wrote a book called}} The World of Ted Serios: [...] "Thoughtographic" [...] Studies of an Extraordinary Mind (1967) arguing that Serios's purported psychic abilities were genuine. However, professional photographers and skeptics found that Serios was employing simple sleight of hand.|$|E
50|$|On March 22, 2010, it was {{announced}} they were successful in manufacturing <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> compatible with Polaroid SX-70/600 instant cameras. Two new products were announced — PX100 and PX600. Their PX100 Silver Shade <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> is a manipulable, monochromatic replacement of old Polaroid brand <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> compatible with SX-70 cameras while the PX600 Silver Shade <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> is compatible with 600 cameras. That formulation has since been supplanted by improved films.|$|E

50|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>film</b> {{is notable}} for {{having had a}} wider range of film speeds {{available}} than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000. Current <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the quality}} of {{integral}} <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> {{is not as good}} as conventional film, peel apart black and white film, {{and to a lesser extent}} color film approached {{the quality of}} traditional film types. <b>Instant</b> <b>film</b> was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for passports and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use <b>instant</b> <b>film</b> for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. <b>Instant</b> <b>film</b> is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. <b>Instant</b> <b>film</b> has been supplanted for most purposes by digital photography, which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or printed with dye sublimation, inkjet, or laser home or professional printers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{abstract}} is to document and explain an exhibition of photographic art work using the now extinct Kodak <b>instant</b> print <b>film.</b> The exhibition resulted from using what were probably the last 100 unexposed pieces of Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> print <b>film</b> available in Southern California, and possibly the last available in the country. The exhibition took place April 3 - 10, 1987 in the North Art Gallery of California State University, Northridge.

50|$|In {{more recent}} years, Fujifilm {{introduced}} {{a line of}} <b>instant</b> cameras and <b>film</b> in Japanese and Asian markets. Fujifilm called their instant camera line Fotorama. Starting in the early 1980s the F series of cameras include the F-10, F-50S and F-62AF. In the mid-1980s it introduced the 800 series with models such as the MX800, 850E, and Mr Handy collapsible. The ACE cameras were introduced in the mid-1990s with film identical to the 800 film but with a different cartridge. The integral films {{are based on the}} Kodak line of <b>instant</b> camera <b>films.</b> The <b>instant</b> <b>films</b> FI-10/PI-800/ACE series are somewhat compatible with the Kodak line of instant cameras, with minor modifications to the cartridge to make it fit. The F series film was discontinued in 1994 but similar modifications on other Fujifilm cartridges can be made.|$|R

Kodachrome film production ceased in 2009, and K-14 processing is no longer available as of December 30, 2010. Ilfochrome materials use the dye destruction process.|$|R

The blight created by carelessly discarded caustic-chemical-laden Polaroid negatives, which tended to accumulate most heavily at the prettiest, most snapshot-worthy locations, horrified Polaroid founder Edwin Land and prompted him to develop the later SX-70 system, which produced no separate negative to discard.|$|R

50|$|She is {{now known}} for her use of a Polaroid 20 by 24 inch camera (one of only 6 in existence), from which she creates large prints.

50|$|Some Polaroid <b>instant</b> <b>films</b> are {{suitable}} for various forms of alternative processing leading to artistic effects. One form was the manipulation of SX-70 using various tools before the emulsion dried to create an oil painting effect. However, SX-70 {{is no longer in}} production and similar films by the Impossible Project {{do not have the same}} manipulable qualities. Emulsion lifting can be achieved by soaking Polaroid, Fuji peel-apart, and some Impossible Project's films in water and then transferring the emulsion to a new surface like wood, metal or paper. Image Transfers are another method of transferring the image from <b>instant</b> peel-apart <b>film</b> to a new surface. Image Transfers are done by peeling the negative positive sandwich apart early in development and pushing the wet negative side down firmly onto a sheet of print-making paper and applying an even pressure with a roller transferring it to the new surface.|$|R
