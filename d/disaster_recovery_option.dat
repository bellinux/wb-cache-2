40|$|Abstract — Disaster Management is {{a wide-ranging}} subject that {{encompasses}} disaster prevention, disaster management and disaster management control. The purpose of <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> is {{to respond to}} disastrous events {{and to have a}} fully operational plan ready to be put into place. Disasters are something that an organization cannot afford to not be prepared for. As firms grow more dependant on uninterrupted information system functioning, <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> is receiving increasing attention, {{and a growing number of}} organizations are beginning to engage in <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> Planning. Preparing a <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> Plan can be a daunting task for an Information Technology Department that has not had to think about recovering vital systems before. The <b>Disaster</b> <b>Recovery</b> Plan itself should be clear and concise and able to be understood at any level of knowledge. A key concern in the management of <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> is that mistakes do not occur in the recovery phase. A realistic disaster exercise is where the <b>disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> team will gain the most mileage and make the most impact in a number of areas. Tests and exercises are vital sources of feedback and short of experiencing a real disaster they are the only way of ensuring that the recovery plan will work...|$|R
50|$|<b>Disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> (DR) {{involves}} {{a set of}} policies, procedures and tools to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced <b>disaster.</b> <b>Disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> focuses on the IT or technology systems supporting critical business functions, as opposed to business continuity, which involves keeping all essential aspects of a business functioning despite significant disruptive events. <b>Disaster</b> <b>recovery</b> is therefore a subset of business continuity.|$|R
