They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> retail stores and elevators.

SimTower, which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.|$|E

5|$|On 17 June 2013, the {{municipality}} executive of Aalborg {{decided not to}} bid for hosting the contest due to the city's lack of sufficient hotel capacity. While DR required the host city {{to have at least}} 3,000 <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> the city of Aalborg had only 1,600 <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> more than half of which had been booked for other events taking {{place at the same time}} as the Eurovision Song Contest. On 18 June 2013, DR announced that formal bids on hosting the contest had been received by the municipalities of Copenhagen, Herning and Horsens, and that the Municipality of Fredericia had confirmed its intention to place a formal bid, too.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand. Prior to {{the first day of}} ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand. In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> was so great that many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E

5|$|During {{the days}} before the storm's arrival in Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories. Extensive {{preparations}} that resulted in a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials—including bread and butter—as people prepared for the storm.|$|E

5|$|In 1963 it was {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations to the road layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907.

5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E

Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available, as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> some may be made available to the general public. On 21 November 2012, SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{findings}} that the <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> tax {{can be passed}} on are contradicted in this re-examination of the tax. Tax incidence analysis is used to illustrate {{the extent to which}} hotel operators can pass on the tax, and evidence is presented that tourists are moreprice-sensitive than previously believed. The suggestion is made that earmarking the tax funds to develop the tourist industry may help overcome negative effects. Many tourist destinations levy special <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> (tran-sient accommodation) taxes to generate revenue to finance government services. The <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> tax is a popular tax because it is perceived to be an efficient way to raise tax revenues from nonresidents. Both conventional wisdom and past academic research have suggested that such a tax, par-ticularly if it is small, can be passed on fully to <b>hotel</b> <b>room</b> guests with no loss in room sales. However, more recent empirical results contradict this traditional view.

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{victory in}} the 2006 Gator Bowl had {{far-reaching}} effects for both the Hokies and the Louisville Cardinals. The win pushed Tech to 11–2 on the season, while the Cardinals' loss ensured they ended the 2005 season with a 9–3 overall record. The game itself provided more than $14million in economic benefit to the Jacksonville area as Louisville and Virginia Tech fans flocked to the region, spending money on food, <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms,</b> transportation, and entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s {{there has}} been a {{significant}} expansion of tourist facilities, culminating in the opening of the 240-room Comwell Hotel in July 2014, which increased the number of <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> in the city by 25%.

5|$|In the Demi's Birthday Suit August 1992 {{issue of}} Vanity Fair, Moore was {{shown on the}} cover in the body {{painting}} photo by Joanne Gair. The painting is a memorable example of modern body painting artwork. It made Gair an immediate pop culture star as the most prominent body paint artist, which prompted consideration for an Absolut Vodka Absolut Gair ad campaign. The 1992 cover, which required a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists, was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot, and reserved two mobile homes, four <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> and five houses.|$|E
