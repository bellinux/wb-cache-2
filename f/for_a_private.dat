5|$|The castle was {{probably}} built for John Harington, 1st Baron Harington (b. 1281–d. 1347). Gleaston Castle is first mentioned in 1389, although John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington {{is said to}} have died there in 1363. In 1415 John Harington was granted a papal indult <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> chapel and a portable altar for mass. It is likely, however, that the castle would have had its own chapel before this date.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan {{resented the}} fact that Breckinridge had {{supported}} both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told {{to come to the}} White House and ask for Harriet Lane, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.|$|E

5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist.

5|$|In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to {{live with}} his {{maternal}} grandfather and attend the city's Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end of colonialism in Egypt {{in the wake of the}} 1923 Egyptian constitution's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out.|$|E

The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, {{due in part to the}} excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House {{with other members of}} the International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E

After this incident, a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the officers and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more strict.|$|E
5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E

She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length.

5|$|The {{production}} exceeded {{its original}} $60,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) budget during editing. Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted). A film production group, Pie in the Sky, provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) {{in exchange for}} 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper {{and the rest of}} the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Pictures.
