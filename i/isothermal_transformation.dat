50|$|<b>Isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> {{diagrams}} (also {{known as}} time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a logarithmic scale). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and {{are useful for}} understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. An <b>isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they {{also can be used}} to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.|$|E

The effect of intercritical annealing temperature and <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> (IBT) time at 465 C on mechanical properties and microstructure were determined. The best combination of strength and ductility was obtained for the lower intercritical annealing temperature of 750 °C for an <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> time of 90 s at 465 °C. However, after intercritical annealing at a higher temperature of 797 °C, optimum mechanical properties were obtained for a shorter <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> time of 60 s at 465 °C, likely due to the lower C content of the intercritical austenite bringing about faster transformation kinetics.

5000|$|The {{austempering}} {{of steel}} was first pioneered in the 1930s by Edgar C. Bain and Edmund S. Davenport, {{who were working}} for the United States Steel Corporation at that time.

50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite {{due to the}} toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by <b>isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers.

5000|$|<b>Isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> (IT) diagram or the C-curve is {{associated}} with mechanical properties, microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; For example the beginning of pearlitic transformation {{is represented by the}} pearlite start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and Bainite, form; Pearlite [...] forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{research}} into the <b>isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> of steels {{was a result of}} Bain and Davenport's discovery of a new microstructure consisting of an [...] "acicular, dark etching aggregate." [...] This microstructure was found to be [...] "tougher for the same hardness than tempered Martensite". Commercial exploitation of bainitic steel did not become common overnight. Common heat treating practices at the time featured continuous cooling methods and were not capable, in practice, of producing fully Bainitic microstructures. The range of alloys available produced either mixed microstructures or excessive amounts of Martensite. The advent of low-carbon steels containing boron and molybdenum in 1958 allowed fully Bainitic steel to be produced by continuous cooling. Commercial use of bainitic steel thus came about {{as a result of the}} development of new heat treating methods, those that involve a step holding the work piece at a fixed temperature for a period of time sufficient to allow transformation became collectively known as austempering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} tensile {{deformation}} {{on the amount}} of hcp phase formed during a 3 hour isothermal aging at 800 °C is studied using in-situ X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It is shown that the start of the <b>isothermal</b> martensitic <b>transformation</b> during aging of this material is delayed by prior plastic deformation. Nevertheless, the total amount of hcp phase present in the microstructure at the beginning of aging increases at a continuously decreasing rate due to stress-assisted transformation. This behavior is attributed to the relieving of internal stresses produced by plastic deformation prior to aging. Finally, during the last stage of aging, the amount of hcp phase in the microstructure increases as a result of <b>isothermal</b> martensitic <b>transformation.</b> It is suggested that the presence of mechanically-induced hcp phase during aging inhibits the thermally activated nucleation process that leads to the <b>isothermal</b> martensitic <b>transformation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> temperature on a fraction of retained austenite for a new-developed C-Mn-Si-Al-Nb-Ti TRIP-type steel. Design/methodology/approach: The thermo-mechanical processing was realized in a multi-stage compression test by the use of the Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. The steel was subjected to six variants of processing with an <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> temperature in a range from 250 to 500 °C. Identification of phase composition was achieved using microstructure observations and X-ray diffraction. To determine the fraction of retained austenite the Rietveld method was applied. Findings: The maximum fraction of retained austenite equal up to 16 % can be obtained for the temperatures of <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> from 400 to 450 °C, while the maximum carbon content in the γ phase equal 1. 5 wt. % is present at the temperature of 350 °C. Below 350 °C due to high Ms temperature, the largest grains of retained austenite located in the ferritic matrix transform to marteniste. In a temperature range from 350 to 450 °C, the Msγ temperature has a negative value, stabilizing the retained austenite. Research limitations/implications: To determine in detail the influence of <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> conditions on a fraction of retained austenite, the knowledge of the effect of isothermal holding time is also important. Practical implications: The obtained microstructures and especially retained austenite fraction dependent on an <b>isothermal</b> bainitic <b>transformation</b> temperature can be useful in optimization of thermo-mechanical processing conditions of C-Mn-Si-Al TRIP-type steels. Originality/value: Combined colour etching and X-ray diffraction methods were applied for microstructure identification of modern group of TRIP steels predicted to use in the automotive industry...|$|R
