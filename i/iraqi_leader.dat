5|$|Hergé {{incorporated}} several characters {{into the}} story who had previously been introduced in earlier Adventures; this included Dr. Müller, a German villain who had previously appeared in The Black Island, and the Portuguese merchant Oliviera da Figueira, who had first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh. Hergé also included {{a reference to the}} recurring character Bianca Castafiore, whose singing appears on the radio in one scene. He also introduced a number of new characters in the story; this included the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, a character who was based largely on Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia, whom Hergé had learned about from a 1939 book by Anton Zischke. It has also been suggested that the character was partly inspired by the deceased <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader,</b> Faisal I. The character of the Emir's son, Prince Abdullah, was inspired by the King of Iraq, Faisal II, who was appointed monarch in 1939 aged four, although in creating this character Hergé had also been influenced by an obnoxious child character that appears in the work of O. Henry.|$|E

She was elected to the Italian parliament in 1987, with approximately 20,000 votes.

25|$|In February and March 2003, {{he visited}} Iraq {{and talked with}} Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as a special {{representative}} of President Putin. He brought to Baghdad a message from Putin to call for Saddam to resign voluntarily. He tried to prevent the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} to the United Nations, among other things. However, the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> told Primakov he was confident that no harm would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Saddam's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government.|$|E
500|$|Saddam Hussein, who is {{believed}} to have said, [...] "The air force has never decided a war," [...] nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch Scud missiles against Israel, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait. These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle, so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into Saudi Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.|$|E

500|$|Thatcher {{was in the}} US on a {{state visit}} when <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> Saddam Hussein invaded {{neighbouring}} Kuwait in August 1990. During her talks with President George H. W. Bush, who had succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention, and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that [...] "This {{was no time to}} go wobbly!" [...] Thatcher's government supplied military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991. She applauded the coalition victory as a backbencher, but warned that [...] "the victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war". It has since been made public that Thatcher suggested threatening Saddam with chemical weapons after the invasion of Kuwait.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{has also}} noted that, while President Bush [...] "never {{directly}} accused the former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> {{of having a}} hand in the attacks on New York and Washington", he [...] "repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September", adding that [...] "Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two." [...] For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that [...] "We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America." [...] The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that [...] "70% of Americans believe the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> was personally involved in the attacks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{guards at}} the Baghdad {{detention}} facility called their prisoner [...] "Vic," [...] which stands for 'Very Important Criminal', and let him plant a small garden near his cell. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> that emerged during a March 2008 tour of the Baghdad prison and cell where Saddam slept, bathed, and kept a journal and wrote poetry {{in the final days}} before his execution; he was concerned to ensure his legacy and how the history would be told. The tour was conducted by U.S. Marine Maj. Gen. Doug Stone, overseer of detention operations for the U.S. military in Iraq at the time.|$|E

At no point, however, did the U.S. directly supply arms to Iraq. Of particular interest for contemporary Iran–United States relations are the repeated accusations that the U.S. government actively encouraged <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leader</b> Saddam Hussein to invade Iran (proponents of this theory frequently describe the U.S. as having given Saddam a [...] "green light"), supported by {{a considerable amount of}} circumstantial evidence, but the U.S. government officially denies that any such collusion occurred, and no conclusive proof of it has been found by scholars that have studied the issue.|$|E
