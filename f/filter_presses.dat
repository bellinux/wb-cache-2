40|$|Abstract. Hydrometallurgy is {{a popular}} {{metallurgical}} technology. <b>Filter</b> <b>press</b> is common but vital {{to the production of}} hydrometallurgy. Hence, the process monitoring of <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is of great significance for hydrometallurgy. Due to data analysis and related knowledge of <b>filter</b> <b>press,</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to process monitoring of the <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> via two traditional statistics. However, modeling and test data collected from actual production suffers from outliers, missing data, inconsistent sampling period between variables. Based on these practical problems, corresponding data proceeding technique is proposed. The final application simulation illustrates the validity of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|Many debates {{have been}} {{discussed}} {{about whether or not}} <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> are sufficient to compete with modern equipment currently {{as well as in the}} future, since <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> were among one of the oldest machine-driven dewatering devices. Efficiency improvements are possible in many applications where modern <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have the best characteristics for the job, however, despite the fact that many mechanical improvements have been made, <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> still remain to operate on the same concept as when first invented. A lack of progress in efficiency improvement as well as a lack of research on conquering associated issues surrounding <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have suggested a possibility of performance inadequacy. At the same time, many other types of filter could do the same or better job as press filters. In certain cases, it is crucial to compare characteristics and performances.|$|E

25|$|A belt <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is {{also known}} for its high {{capacity}} throughput, as {{it is designed to}} handle excess capacity.

A standard size filter press offers a filter area of 216 m2, whereas a standard belt filter only offers approximately 15 m2.|$|E

It consists of larger plate and frame <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> with mechanical [...] "plate shifters". The function of the plate shifter is to move the plates and allow rapid discharge of the filter cakes accumulated in between the plates. It also contains a diaphragm compressor in the filter plates which aids in optimizing the operating condition by further drying the filter cakes. An animation showing this principal of operation can be seen here.|$|E

50|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} used to dewater high-solids slurries in metal processing plants, one of the press filter technology that could deliver the job is the Rotary Pressure Filter method, which provides continuous production in a single unit, where filtration is directed via pressure. However, in cases where solids concentration in high-solids slurries is too high (50%+), {{it is better to}} handle these slurries using vacuum filtration, such as a continuous Indexing Vacuum Belt Filter, since high concentration of solids in slurries will increase pressure and if pressure is too high, the equipment might be damaged and/or less efficient operation.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 Flottweg {{expanded}} its {{into a business}} sector: the production of liquid-solid separation machines. The first product was the Flottweg Decanter, a solid bowl decanter centrifuge; the first model, DECANTER Z1, was sold to BASF. Further development lead to a higher speed and more efficient decanter in 1964. In 1966 an adjustable impeller for decanter was added, which allowed the operator to optimise the pond depth while the decanter was operating; this was useful in the extraction of olive oil. After further development, Flottweg sold a 3-phase decanter for olive oil in Spain in 1971. In 1977 Flottweg began to manufacture belt <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> {{used in the}} {{refining}} process consisted of mats of woven wire and canvas. In constant use, the wire eventually was abraded {{to the point where}} it pierced the canvas, reducing the efficiency of the filter. Hendrick reasoned that a metal sheet, properly perforated, could replace the canvas-and-wire filter, giving it a longer life. Several tries at drilling holes, first individually, then in a multiple drill-press proved that the concept was sound, but the production process was too costly. He then conceived the idea of punching holes simultaneously in the sheet metal. The metal-punching machine he developed was a pilot for the modern perforating press and the foundation upon which Hendrick Manufacturing Company was started in 1876.|$|E
