50|$|In February 1946, Chamberlin joined Avro Aircraft Ltd. in Toronto, the Canadian {{subsidiary}} of the British Avro, itself part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, where Chamberlin was chief aerodynamicist on the C102 Jetliner and CF-100 Canuck <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor.</b> Later, as chief of technical design for the CF-105 Avro Arrow <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor,</b> he generated many of the ideas {{that would make the}} design famous.|$|R

5000|$|A major {{lesson learned}} by SAC during the Korean War was that its propeller-driven bomber force, the B-50s and B-36s were {{essentially}} rendered obsolete by the MiG-15 <b>jet</b> <b>interceptors</b> {{used by the}} North Koreans. Under attack by the MiGs, Far East Air Force was forced to switch from daylight bombing to night attacks, which although safer, did not eliminate the MiG threat which the bombers had little effective defense. The [...]50-caliber machine gun defense by the bombers were ineffective against the <b>jet</b> <b>interceptors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lavochkin La-200 (a.k.a. Aircraft 200) was a two-seater, swept winged, {{night and}} bad weather <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> fighter {{designed}} and manufactured by the Lavochkin Design Bureau from 1948.|$|R
25|$|Its {{slow speed}} made it {{vulnerable}} to Soviet <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> aircraft, making long-range bombardment flights over Soviet territory extremely hazardous, seriously compromising {{its ability to}} reach its planned target and return.|$|R
50|$|Fisher {{returned}} to the Air Defense Command and flew <b>jet</b> <b>interceptors</b> until he retired to his hometown of Kuna, Idaho, where {{he lived with his}} wife Realla until her death on April 27, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Mass {{sighting}} of large, silent, low-flying black triangles in Ans, Wallonia, which were tracked by multiple NATO radar and <b>jet</b> <b>interceptors,</b> and investigated by Belgium's military. Photographic evidence exists. One close encounter was reported.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} {{reclassified}} AGR-9 effective 28 September 1958. She continued radar picket station duties for the Continental Air Defense Command, detecting and tracking inbound airborne objects and controlling <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> aircraft until decommissioned 29 March 1965.|$|R
25|$|Until <b>jet</b> <b>interceptors</b> {{could be}} {{developed}} and put into service, the Twin Mustangs already built were seen as an interim solution to SAC's fighter escort mission for its strategic bomber force and also as an all-weather air defense interceptor.|$|R
50|$|Chris Gainor is a {{historian}} of technology specializing in space exploration and aeronautics. He has written four {{books on the}} history of space exploration and on the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> aircraft canceled by the Canadian government in 1959.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, {{the unit}} transitioned from the F-89J <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> to a large, heavy transport, the Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, a double-decked, four-engine airplane. The new mission moved the wing into the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), and its {{successor}} Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966.|$|R
50|$|After the Korean War, the {{squadron}} {{was equipped with}} the long-range F-51H Mustang and {{became a part of}} Air Defense Command.

50|$|The Focke-Wulf Super Lorin was a German <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> project.

50|$|Toronto {{was home}} to the {{construction}} of a number of advanced aircraft in the post-war years including the Avro Canada Jetliner, the Avro CF-100 <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> and the fabled Avro Arrow.

50|$|Operated a Manual Direction Center. The day-to-day {{operations}} of the command was to train and maintain tactical flying units flying <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> aircraft (F-94 Starfire; F-102 Delta Dagger; F-106 Delta Dart) {{in a state of}} readiness with training missions and series of exercises with SAC and other units simulating interceptions of incoming enemy aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The 1976 Tehran UFO Incident was a {{radar and}} visual {{sighting}} of an {{unidentified flying object}} (UFO) over Tehran, the capital of Iran, during {{the early morning hours}} of 19 September 1976.

50|$|The 83d FIS was {{initially}} {{equipped with the}} Northrup F-89B Scorpion <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor.</b> In June 1953, the F-89s were replaced by the Republic F-84G Thunderjet, another first generation jet aircraft pressed into the interceptor role by ADC. In December 1953, the first true ADC-dedicated interceptor, the F-86D Sabre was received by the 83d FIS that replaced the World War II-designed Thunderjets.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{transfer}} to TAC of the 94th FIS, it {{was replaced by}} the 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (23d AD) on 1 July 1971 which took over the 94th FIS's F-106s.

5000|$|In August, {{the base}} became {{a base for}} day interceptors against the American Eighth Air Force bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. As part of the [...] "Defense of the Reich" [...] campaign, Messerschmitt Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) {{attacked}} the heavy bombers.

5000|$|Today the California Air National Guard 144th Fighter Wing (144 FW) {{occupies}} {{two separate}} parcels of {{land at the}} airport—the main base area and the Munitions Storage Area.

50|$|However, the {{facilities}} at Stout Field were inadequate for <b>jet</b> <b>interceptor</b> fighters {{and as a}} result the squadron was moved to Hulman Field, at Terre Haute, on 1 January 1954. In July 1954 the Mustangs were retired and the squadron was re-equipped with F-80C Shooting Star jets that had seen combat in the Korean War. In March 1956, conversion to refurbished and reconditioned F-86A Sabres commenced, and in April 1958 new F-84F Thunderstreaks were received.|$|R
