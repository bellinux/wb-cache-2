The deformation {{that occurs}} within the greenstone belts represents a dome-and-keel structure or {{the rise of}} diapiric plutons. This model provides {{an explanation for the}} dome-and-keel structure associated with greenstone belts. When dense basaltic lavas erupt on top of ductile, less dense TTGs they become weighed down by the overburden and squeeze out from areas with less stress. Partial convective overturn is a related idea stating that a thick, dense, cool greenstone cover in the upper crust acts as an insulator to the underlying hot granitic middle crust. Previously metamorphosed dense amphibolites {{at the base of the}} overlying greenstone layer sank down into a partially melted granitic middle crust. These sinking greenstones forced the granitic partial melts sideways and upwards, emplacing them into the margins of the belt and later folding them. The greenstone cover allows the <b>granitic</b> <b>layer</b> to remobilize and form the dome structure. This two stage event is dated between 3.26 and 3.22 Ga.|$|E

The direction of maximum compressive stress (σ_ 1) is horizontal within the shallow levels of both models.

40|$|A horizontally-layered, biotite-rich diorite-gabbro in the Wanup pluton near Sudbury, Canada, {{is shown}} to be folded into a tight, nearly isoclinal {{anticline}} and then to evolve into a layered quartz monzonite-granodiorite body containing parallel bands of thin amphibolite layers. This evolution occurred during K- and Si-metasomatism that {{was made possible by}} strong deformation that accompanied the folding. Myrmekite grains with fine, intermediate, and coarse quartz vermicules occur in the <b>granitic</b> <b>layers,</b> respectively, at the top, middle, and bottom of the former layered diorite-gabbro. Maximum sizes of the vermicules in myrmekite and of quartz blebs in ghost myrmekite in microcline correlate with the plagioclase An-values in the more Na- and K-rich top, in the middle layers, and in the more Ca-, Mg-, and Fe-rich bottom of the Wanup pluton. The Wanup pluton {{is an example of the}} way many Precambrian granitic bodies may have evolved. First, incompatible K in the mantle migrated upward in water-rich magmas that crystallized as biotite-rich tonalites, diorites, and gabbros, lacking orthoclase. Subsequently, deformation in the earth???s crust during plate tectonics caused dehydration of the solidified biotite-rich tonalites, diorites, and gabbros. During the dehydration process, K was released from the biotite as some of the deformed biotite and coexisting hornblende were replaced by quartz during Si-metasomatism. The mobilized K moved into deformed and altered, relatively-calcic plagioclase grains to form microcline. Much of the Na in the primary plagioclase, which was displaced by K to form the microcline, replaced other altered plagioclase crystals to form more-sodic recrystallized plagioclase. In all of the aforesaid processes much Ca, Fe, Mg, and Al were lost from the system, perhaps carried upward in hydrous fluids to be crystallized in lamprophyre dikes. The mineralogical conversions in deformed mafic rocks would occur under subsolidus conditions and change the tonalites, diorites, and gabbros into myrmekite-bearing quartz monzonite or granodiorite and locally into granite. Then, later, re-heating of these rocks above melting temperatures could mobilize them as magmas to form higher-level granitic intrusions...|$|R

A crust-mantle s t r u c t u r e for t h e Zemlya-Toledo p a t h has been determinedby means of group velocity curves and especially by the phase velocityones obtained from Rayleigh waves of explosions.

The average shear velocity in the <b>granitic</b> and basaltic <b>layers</b> jointly,is about 3, 65 km/sec, permitting a small ambiguity at the position of theConrad discontinuity between them. A velocity of 4, 5 km/sec has been assigned for the underlying crustmaterial, but a better agreement with the data recorded is obtained bytaking 0. 28 for the Poisson ratio value.

This paper examines blockage in three continental regions where the Lg blockages {{may be caused by}} large, enclosed sedimentary basins along the propagation path. The Barents Sea Basin blocks Lg propagation across the Barents Sea from the Russian nuclear test sites at Novaya Zemlya to Scandinavian stations. Also, ``early Lg' ' waves are observed in Sn codas on NORSAR, NORESS, and ARCESS recordings of Novaya Zemlya explosions where direct Lg is blocked. Early Lg waves may have resulted from Sn-to-Lg mode conversion at the contact between the Barents Basin and the Kola Peninsula. The Northern and Southern Caspian Sea Basins also block Lg waves from PNEs and earthquakes, perhaps due to thick, low-velocity, low-Q sediments replacing the <b>granitic</b> <b>layer</b> rocks in the crust. Lg blockage has also been observed in the Western Mediterranean/Levantine Basin due to low-Q sediments and crustal thinning. A ``basin capture' ' model is proposed to explain Lg blockage in sedimentary basins. In this model, shear waves that reverberate in the crust and constitute the Lg wave train are captured, delayed, and attenuated by thick, low-velocity sediments that replace the ``granitic' ' layer rocks of the upper crust along part of the propagation path. Sn waves, which propagate below the basin, would not be blocked and in fact, the blocked Lg waves may be diverted downward into Sn waves by the low velocity sediments in the basin...|$|E

In the 1996 experiment, there were 3 shots, 236 observation sites, and 228 km measurement line, which extended north. Observation sensors were set at the same places except for the extended line of the second experiment. To establish a P wave crustal structure model, ray-trace forward modeling and inversion technique were used.

Numerical modeling based on finite element analysis is an effective tool for studying the elastic behaviors of earth's crust due to tectonic movement. This study describes how to use an advanced numerical modeling technique, the finite element method, to compute rock deformation and to predict stress and fault development as a function of material properties, cohesion and friction angle. Stress distribution and fault development of 2 dimensional plane strain FEM models of four Himalayan cross sections are described. SW (south west) to NE (north east) horizontal shortening up to maximum 375 m (equivalent displacement at 7. 5 cm/yr of 5000 yr) is applied at the southwestern end of the cross-sections. Proposed models show that the direction of maximum principal stresses (σ_ 1) are horizontal along the shallower part of all the models. Variation of the velocity boundary condition indicates the changes of direction of principal stresses along the deeper part while that along the shallower part remain unchanged.

To bring new constrains on the variation of crustal properties we use P-receiver functions and ambient seismic noise. Using these methods we quantify Moho depth and depth-velocity variations across the crust. P-receiver functions indicate the presence of a high velocity layer {{at the base of the}} crust, interpreted as magmatic underplating or eclogitization. Ambient seismic noise provides data from Rayleigh wave seismic tomography and identifies the presence of a low velocity layer associated with granite intrusion in the upper-middle crust. Our new crustal thickness map shows that the topography at the surface is not reflected by the Moho topography in this region. We observe a relative thickening of the crust from the Atlantic coast (40 km) to the Gulf of Bothnia (44 km). Secondly, Moho sharpness analysis and 1 D depth-velocity profiles show a difference in the transition from crust and upper mantle. A high velocity layer (Vp> 7. 1 km. s− 1) beneath the Baltic shield is missing beneath the Scandinavian mountains. This observation explains the crustal thickness variations beneath the mountain belt and the shield, with magmatic underplating beneath the shield and a delamination of the lower crust due to eclogitization process beneath the mountain range. In addition the presence of a local low density <b>layer</b> (<b>granitic</b> body) in the upper crust beneath the northern mountains seems to be a possible mechanism to explain the presence day topography in this region...|$|R
40|$|Railway ballast, {{which form}} an {{integral}} part of rail tracks, are highly susceptible to subsistence due to both vibration transmitted by the passing trains, as well as the influence of the weathering and contamination effect. The resulting subsistence necessitates regular monitoring and maintenance, involving cost and time consuming remedial actions, such as stone-blowing and ballast renewal. It would be desirable if some measure can be taken in minimize the maintenance costs of railway tracks, consequently to optimizing the passenger comfort. This paper describes the exploratory work on ballast-rubber composites to enhanced the shear resistance of rail tracks and identify the effects of ballast exposure to the weathering and oil contamination. The rubber elements were sourced from tyre inner tubes commonly used for motorcycles, cut and shaped accordingly to produce strips, shreds and circular patch respectively and were arranged in various pre-determined configurations within the ballast <b>layer.</b> <b>Granitic</b> stones of suitable sizes were sieved and used as representative samples of typical ballasts as the tests were mainly carried out with a standard direct shear test setup, i. e. shear box measuring 60 mm x 60 mm. In order to identify the shear resistance deterioration of aggregate-rubber mixture under poor drainage conditions by soaked a batch of aggregates in water, acid and lubricant oil to create the effect from moisture and contamination for 14 days prior to mixing and testing. The direct shear test results indicated that rubber inclusion could effectively improve the shear resistance of ballasts to various degrees, though the configurations clearly {{played an important role in}} the improvement observed. Both type of rubber (i. e. new and used), show similar result due to the degradation of used rubber tube does not too extensive. The shear resistance did not rise dramatically with the rubber reinforcement. This susceptible shear strain plots indicate ductile behaviour on the aggregates-rubber composites. This is evident by the linear rise of shear stress with strain up to approximately 10 % for the control samples (CS) until it reaches a constant value. Note that all the specimens including CS are in a loose state during the testing because there were no tamping been applied on the samples. Overall the circular patch (CP) specimen was the most favourable in all conditions (dry, acid and oil). At ε = 5 %, CP (D) already governed the τave with 170 kPa than the others. In addition, the friction angle for all configurations (dry, acid, oil) was in the ranged 87 ◦- 88 ◦ with the critical specific volume, vcrit was 2. 160. It was followed by the ST (H), which was found to allow better deformation capability with increased ductility of the composite, while the shreds (SH) absorbed impact and reduced breakages of the ballasts. Both mechanisms contributed to the reduced overall subsistence, accompanied by an increase in the shear resistance. The inclusion of rubber elements apparently prevented the dilation of the granular material when approaching the shear failure and the reducing the settlement...|$|R
40|$|In SW England, {{a highly}} {{deformed}} and metamorphosed assemblage of ultramafic, mafic and granitic rocks is interpreted {{to represent a}} fragment of upper mantle and lower oceanic crust: the Lizard Ophiolite Complex. Although the processes involved in the tectonic and chemical evolution of mafic rocks and subsequent emplacement of this complex are well documented, {{the importance of the}} tectonic evolution of the peridotites is poorly constrained. Structural field mapping of deformed peridotites, ultramafic and mafic cumulates and amphibolites, combined with geochronological (sensitive high mass-resolution ion micro-probe), microstructural (optical microscope and universal stage) and geochemical (X-ray fluorescence, ICP-MS and electron microprobe) analyses undertaken as part of this thesis have identified evidence of four tectono magmatic events, three of which occurred during the Early to Late Devonian. An earlier episode relates to a fragment of Ordovician basement that became tectonically incorporated within the basal structural unit of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex. A basement, and structurally lowermost unit, comprising <b>granitic</b> (MOWG) and <b>layered</b> meta-sedimentary and meta-basic (OLHS) rocks of earliest Ordovician age (~ 499 - 488 Ma) is interpreted as fragments of arc-type crust developed in an active magmatic arc during closure of an ocean basin (Rheic ocean?). Tectonic exhumation of mantle along extensional lithosphere-scale mantle shear zones in the Early Devonian or earlier (~ 397 Ma) may be responsible for the early tectonic evolution of the mantle section of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex. It is proposed that this may have occurred during asymmetric extension associated with continental breakup and oceanic rifting. During exhumation, the high-T and high-P mineral assemblage (~ 1200 C & 15 Kb) of the Lizard peridotites progressively re-equilibrated to conditions of lower T and P (~ 919 - 1074 C & 5 - 6 Kb). High temperature (~ 900 - 1050 C) deformation of ultramafic and mafic Traboe cumulates is consistent with deformation and metamorphism of early formed oceanic crust in the hangingwall of the inferred shear zone, which may have been located {{at the base of the}} crustal sequence close to the Moho. The later evolution of a second generation of oceanic crust sequence shown by gabbro and mafic dyke intrusion in the early to middle Devonian (~ 375 Ma) primarily involved magmatism, but NE-SW directed extension of the oceanic crust may have been predominantly accommodated by low-angle ductile shear zones, suggestive of a magma-starved slow- spreading ridge environment. Emplacement of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex took place during the Middle to Late Devonian (~ 390 - 366 Ma). Top-to-the-NW thrusting facilitated decoupling of the mantle and emplacement over deformed and metamorphosed oceanic crust. During emplacement, widespread magmatism involved the intrusion of a mixed suite of felsic and mafic magmas that may well have been focused along the detachment surface. The geochemical characteristics of this suite of intrusive rocks suggests that initial emplacement of the Lizard Ophiolite Complex may have taken place in a subduction zone environment. Extensive, apparently extensional reactivation of thrust contacts involved the development serpentine-filled fault zones. It is proposed that infiltration of volatile-rich melts during the early mantle deformation and exhumation along extensional shear zones could have led to significant localisation of strain and weakening of the upper mantle. The main evidence supporting this hypothesis being mylonitic peridotites that demonstrate confirmation of chemical enrichment as a result of melt impregnation. Weakening may have occurred by replacement of strong mineral phases e. g. pyroxene by weaker phases e. g. amphibole i. e. reaction softening, characterised by the development of mylonitic amphibole-bearing peridotites. It is concluded that this and other weakening processes may also be responsible for the development and enhancement of mantle shear zones in other ophiolite complexes and present-day oceanic lithosphere during oceanic rifting...|$|R
40|$|The Ogasawara Ridge {{is known}} as one of oldest arc on the Philippine Sea Plate. This Ridge has very complex structure. According to {{refraction}} survey crossing the ridge, the ridge has a very thin <b>granitic</b> <b>layer</b> with velocity of approximately 6 km/s, an andesitic layer with a velocity of 6. 4 - 6. 6 km/s and gabbroic layer with a velocity of 7. 0 - 7. 2 km/s (Takahashi et al., 2009). On the other hand, the thin crust with a thickness less than 10 km distributes beneath the shallowest topographic peak (Kodaira et al., 2012). According to geologic studies, boninites, fore-arc basalts, gabbros and peridotites were collected by Shinkai 6500 dives on the trench slope (Ishizuka et al., 2006). The observation is expected to be helpful for subduction initiation studies because these geological sequences are similar characteristics of ophiolite. Therefore, we carried out refraction survey using ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs) along the strike of the Ogasawara Ridge to detect such geological sequences using seismic imaging technique as one of site surveys for IBM drilling. This survey was carried by using R/V “Kairei” of Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in 2011 and we collected not only OBSs data but also multi-channel reflection data (MCSs) on a seismic line with a length of 250 km. Total 43 OBSs were deployed at an interval of 5 km and the airgun shooting with a total capacity of 7800 cu. in. was 200 m interval. First arrivals on OBS records are traced to offsets of 40 - 60 km, and the data is generally noisy suggesting complexity of fore-arc structure. If there is peridotite layer in the hanging wall side, the refractions with apparent velocity of about 8 km/s are identified, and discontinuous jump of the first arrivals should be at far side due to subducting oceanic crust. The observed refractions, however, have apparent velocities between 6. 0 - 7. 5 km/s to far side. Refractions with an apparent velocity of 8 km/s seem to be limited in narrow area. In addition, the jump of first arrivals is also identified on some OBS records, but it is not common character for whole of the line. We introduce the tentative tomographic image obtained by using first arrivals and reflection points distribution. Although the plate boundary structure is very complex, the structure of the hanging wall is relatively homogeneous. Then, we compared the structural image obtained by this study with geologic observation. Poster abstract T 51 D- 2620 presented at 2012 Fall Meeting, AGU, San Francisco, Calif., 3 - 7 Dec...|$|E
