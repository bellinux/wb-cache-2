The test specimens were subjected to transverse temperature differences of up to 200 deg F, and distortion and strain at various locations were measured. The effect of the thermal stress was to increase the amplitude of original distortions. Adddtional distortions due to thermal stress were proportional to temperature differential and to ripple length. Tensile stresses in the side plate sections were measured as approximately 10, 000 psi at maximum reactor temperature difference. Individual weld loadings in shear were measured as 38 lb per weld. Results of the tests were considered inconclusive because of unrepresentative initial plate distortion. (M. C. G. ...|$|E
40|$|A gamma {{scintillation}} spectrometer {{was used to}} measure diffusivity of uranyl nitrate in water during preliminary capillary experiments. During Fluorox run FBR- 22, 90. 4 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / formed was collected in cold traps and chemical traps. Toroid tests of flame calcined mixed Th-U oxide showed low corrosion rates, small changes in particle size and a low solubilization of uranium, while denitration of uranyl nitrate in a fluidized bed resulted in particle growth with uniform layers of uranium oxide. A half-time of 30 min for uranium anion exchange was measured in differential bed studies of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K. The Darex Reference flowsheet operation resulted in chloride removal to less than 50 ppm in solvent extraction feed from APPR head- end treatment. Unirradiated prototype Consolidated Edison pins were dejacketed with 6 M H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / with uranium losses to the dejacketing solution of approximately 0. 2 %. An optimum procedure was developed for clarifying large batches of solvent extraction feed by sand bed filtration. Sheared sections of stainless steel clad UO/sub 2 / were completely leached in onehalf the time required for equal lengths of stainless tubes containing uncrushed pellets. Abrasive disc wheel to metal removal ratios were measured at cutting rates from 10 to 60 in. /min. Dissolution of Zircaloy- 2 <b>dummy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in an INOR- 8 dissolver with the NaF-LiF salt system resulted in vessel wall corrosion rates of 1 - 2 mils/run (approximately 8 hr of HF exposure).
