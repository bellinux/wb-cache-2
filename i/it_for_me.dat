Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

Berk gave it four stars out of five, Burns said [...] "the Warblers sounded fantastic and fun", and Harper said she loved it, and that, like the audience on the show, she [...] "would have given it" [...] a [...] "standing ovation". Stack said he [...] "sorta" [...] hated the song [...] "from sheer overexposure", but [...] "Darren Criss sold <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> with his choreography and acting", {{and gave it a}} [...] "B+".

She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message.

It was recorded in 2010 at Westlake Recording Studios and Vanilla Sky Studios in Los Angeles, California. According to Hilson, the song was Ne-Yo's idea. She said, [...] "I remember Ne-Yo playing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the studio. I loved it as soon as I heard it!" [...] Hilson debuted the song at the Beats By Dr. Dre concert in New York City on September 29, 2010. Later that same day, Rap-Up magazine unveiled the single cover and confirmed that it would serve as the second single from Hilson's second studio album, No Boys Allowed, following its lead single, [...] "Breaking Point".

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, he {{continued}} {{talking about the}} hosting gig at an interview for Playboy. There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you hired me, because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this stuff's going to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry.

500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch is <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down. Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E

500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's <b>It</b> <b>For</b> <b>Me!</b> status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace myself for the probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the atmospherics along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{overlying}} message {{the band}} intended for We Don't Need to Whisper {{is that the}} future could become a utopia. Opening track [...] "Valkyrie Missile" [...] opens We Don't Need to Whisper with a cinematic organ melody, 1980s-influenced guitars and a quote from an astronaut: [...] "Anybody out there?". [...] "Distraction" [...] follows and is filled with hand claps and a keyboard melody over verses lamenting death and destruction. [...] "Do <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> Now" [...] originated from a beat DeLonge created in 2004 for rapper Talib Kweli, who turned the opportunity down; the Morse code beat was later adapted by the band and stimulated DeLonge's vision of the song being the soundtrack to [...] "young lovers watching the sunrise." [...] "The Adventure" [...] is an [...] "exhilarating ode to a beckoning future with a huge guitar sound reminiscent of The Cure." [...] The [...] song was motivated by a friend whose marriage was falling apart when his wife committed adultery. The situation had a deep impact on DeLonge in that he spent a night up crying {{for him when he}} wrote the track. [...] "A Little's Enough" [...] was inspired by a religious concept in which a God came to bring positive change on Earth when it faces terrorism, war or famine.|$|E

500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E

During the promotional campaign {{leading up to the}} release of Reclassified, Azalea revealed that she would be collaborating with Ellie Goulding on a track titled [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] featured in the film [...] In October 2014, while giving an interview with Radio.com, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Goulding, and after meeting her several times, was approached about a song that would eventually become [...] "Heavy Crown". She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] On 14 November, a preview of [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] was uploaded to Azalea's VEVO channel. In December 2014, [...] "Trouble" [...] was announced to be the next single from Reclassified, as opposed to [...] "Heavy Crown".
