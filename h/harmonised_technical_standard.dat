50|$|The Regulation {{provides}} that where a <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standard</b> exists for a construction product {{as defined by}} the Regulation, that product must be tested and certified to that standard by a notified body in order to qualify for a CE Mark. Since EN 54 is the <b>harmonised</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standard</b> for fire detection and alarm products, it appears to follow that products in that field which are brought to market in the European Union must be tested against the provisions of EN 54 and certified accordingly.|$|E

40|$|<b>Harmonised,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> {{in product}} safety {{regulation}} and liability {{have not found}} a final role yet, according to the mainstream. The relevance of compliance with product safety standards has been extensively discussed, mainly in the USA. Nevertheless, it is still highly debated whether {{it could be a}} full defence for manufacturers in a product liability litigation, and whether regulatory standards could become civil liability standards. Considering current precedents’ uncertainty (not only in Italy) referring to the burden of proof of defect in product liability cases, this essay aims to offer a contribute to the debate, by analysing the role of presumption of conformity with the essential requirements provided by harmonised standards, the relationship between the definitions of safe and defective product and, more generally, the interaction between product liability and regulation in the current EU legislation and the functions of tort law...|$|R
40|$|East Asia {{is already}} the main {{destination}} of the world's commercial liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, the gas markets in the EAS area are either underdeveloped or fragmented. The objectives {{of this study are}} twofold, namely, i) to present a review of the trends in global gas market integration and ii) to draw implications and make recommendations for gas market development in the EAS area. To achieve the goal of an integrated gas market in the EAS region, governments in member economies must work together to implement a plan. Specifically, four recommendations are made to the EAS states: adopt a formal program to promote and nurture the development of gas markets in member states and phased sectoral reforms in relatively mature markets; set targets to gradually <b>harmonise</b> regulatory and <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> in the gas sector; coordinate better to promote their "gas" causes; and boost cross-border connectivity and trading within the area and eventually achieve regional gas market integration. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{objective}} of the Baku Initiative is to enhance integration of the energy markets of participating countries with the EU energy market, so as to create transparent energy markets, capable of attracting investment and enhancing security of energy supply. (Other aspects of the Initiative were concerned with transport issues: see main article). The partner countries agreed objectives to <b>harmonise</b> legal and <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> so as to create a functioning integrated energy market in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks; to increase the safety and security of energy supplies by extending and modernising existing infrastructure, substituting outdated power generation infrastructures with environmentally friendly systems; {{the development of new}} infrastructures and implementation of modern monitoring systems; improvement of energy supply and demand management through the integration of efficient and sustainable energy systems; and promotion of the financing of commercially and environmentally viable energy projects of common interest.

40|$|Interactive Digital TV {{services}} are considered nowadays {{as the key}} element to introduce digital TV services and to encourage customers to invest in new digital TV appliances. Some time ago, the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) forum, which already produced a <b>harmonised</b> family of <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> [1, 2, 3], decided to engage the work of defining return channels using the same medium than the broadcast “downstream ” one. Thus, the cable and the satellite medium have been endowed with their dedicated return channel [4, 5]. The last product of this work is called DVB-RCT (Return Channel Terrestrial) [6] and is intended to provide standard specification for interactivity in the UHF/VHF bands. Using the newly defined DVB-RCT standard as a companion of the world-wide proven, recognised and adopted Terrestrial DVB system [3], DVB-T is no longer limited to unidirectional broadcast, it can become a true Terrestrial Wireless Interactive system. The DVB-RCT technical subgroup performed a tremendous work to define the physical layer (RCT-PHY), the Medium Access Control layer (RCT-MAC) and the RF Implementation Guidelines. As a result, the DVB-RCT standard makes use of a Multiple Access OFDM arrangement, to constitute a high bandwidth Wireless Interactive Terrestrial Digital TV system. Officially approved by the DVB forum in April 2001, it will be soon published as an ETSI European standard (EN 301 958). Two European Research projects (WITNESS and IM 4 DTTV – Integrated Modem for Digital Terrestrial TV) {{have been set up}} to support the roll-out of DVB-RCT through extensive field trials and the design of an integrated VLSI solution for the user terminal. Thus, fast and cost-effective integration of the DVB-RCT standard in the Terrestrial Digital TV set-top boxes are expected. Following a presentation of the DVB-RCT technical specifications, the two projects dealing with the future of the DVB-RCT standard are presented in this paper...|$|R

The NASA <b>Technical</b> <b>Standards</b> Program was formed in 1997 in response to the NASA Administrator s directive to develop an Agencywide <b>Technical</b> <b>Standards</b> Program. The Program s principal objective involved the converting Center-unique <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> into Agency wide standards and the adoption/endorsement of non-Government <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> in lieu of government standards.
