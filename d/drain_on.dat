5|$|Bomis created Nupedia {{as a free}} online {{encyclopedia}} (with content {{submitted by}} experts) {{but it had a}} tedious, slow review process. Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of the dot-com crash. Since Wikipedia was a <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund the project as a charity; Sanger was laid off from Bomis in 2002. Nupedia content was merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E
5|$|By 2003 Wikipedia {{had grown}} to 100,000 {{articles}} in its English-language version, and it became difficult for Bomis to continue financially supporting the project. With Wikipedia a <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> the company's resources, Wales and Sanger decided to fund the project on a non-profit basis. Bomis laid off most of its employees to continue operating, since Wikipedia was not generating revenue. The company owned Wikipedia from its creation through 2003, and Wales used about $100,000 of Bomis' revenue to fund Wikipedia before the decision to shift the encyclopedia to non-profit status.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1945, the {{economic}} <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> Britain {{due to her}} sustained war effort was becoming critical, and a new proposal, with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown, christened 'Design X', was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC. 'Design X', along with the earlier preferred 'B3' variant Battleship design were further refined through October 1945, when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret. This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy.|$|E

40|$|The objectIves of the {{research}} were to study the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> the population and life cycle of root-knot nematode of rice (Meloidogyne graminicola).  To study the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> the population of M. graminicola two experiments were done within two period of planting of rice IR 64. These experiments were arranged in completely randomize design with four replications. For studying the effect of flooding and <b>draining</b> <b>on</b> {{the life cycle of}} M. graminicola, the experiment was done within 30 days. The research results showed: 1) continuously flooding inhibit the penetration and population development of M. graminicola on rice IR 64, but the life cycle of M. graminicola was not affected; and 2) seventy two hours period of draining enhanced the development of M. graminicola compared to period of draining shorter than 72 hours...|$|R
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier {{to pick up and}} play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> Bethesda's staff.|$|E
5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.

The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} a brief summary of {{research}} on the effect of longitudinal <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> subgrade support. The Iowa DOT began installing longitudinal subdrains at a depth of 24 " in 1978. The trend in Iowa has been to deeper longitudinal drains with the present standard being 48 " deep. A very limited amount of data would indicate that the deeper longitudinal drains are providing a greater benefit to the subgrade support value. The 24 # deep drains of the Poweshiek Interstate 80 project yielded a spring subgrade support value of 165. The 30 " deep <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> Pottawattamie Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 170 while the 48 "deep <b>drains</b> <b>on</b> Cass County Interstate 80 yielded a K value of 210. This limited amount of data would indicate that the deeper drains provide greater benefit to improvement of the subgrade support values...|$|R

5|$|James of Saint George, {{a famous}} {{architect}} and engineer from Savoy, was probably {{responsible for the}} bulk of the construction work across the region. The castles were extremely costly to build and required labourers, masons, carpenters, diggers, and building resources to be gathered by local sheriffs from across England, mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved placed a significant <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> the country's national labour force. The total financial cost cannot be calculated with certainty, but estimates suggest that Edward's castle building programme cost at least £80,000 – four times the total royal expenditure on castles between 1154 and 1189.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a <b>drain</b> <b>on</b> the company.

However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E

5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached {{right up to}} the base of the castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, and would have been difficult for an attacker to <b>drain.</b> <b>On</b> the east side of the castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
