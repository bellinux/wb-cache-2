40|$|An {{invertase}} was purified from Cichorium intybus L. roots by {{a combination}} of ammonium sulphate precipitation, Concanavalin A affinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. A 230 -fold purification and a final specific activity of 2. 7 U per mg protein was obtained. The enzyme had a M(r) of 93 000 as estimated by gel filtration and after SDS-PAGE a single band with a M(r) of 50000 was found. Optimal activity was found between pH 5 and pH 5. 5. At low substrate concentrations equal amounts of fructose and glucose were produced (apparent K(m) 55 mm). At higher sucrose concentrations progressively more <b>isokestose</b> was produced and fructose synthesis was inhibited. The high sucrose concentrations needed for <b>isokestose</b> synthesis do not support a physiological role for the enzyme in fructan biosynthesis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSucrose-sucrose 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -SST) was {{purified}} 100 -fold from tubers of Helianthus tuberosus L. The purified enzyme {{was essentially}} devoid of invertase activity {{and could be}} separated by isoelectric focusing into five isoforms which all were composed of two subunits (59 and 26 kDa). Fructan-fructan 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -FFT) was purified from the same source [M. Lüscher et al. (1993) New Phytologist 123, 437 – 442). When incubated individually with sucrose, 1 -FFT was inactive while 1 -SST formed <b>isokestose</b> (trimer) and, upon prolonged incubation, some nystose (tetramer). When {{a combination of the}} two enzymes was incubated with sucrose, a series of oligofructosides with a degree of polymerization of up to 20 was formed. Amino acid sequences of tryptic peptide fragments from both 1 -SST and 1 -FFT indicate that these enzymes are highly homologous with plant invertases...|$|E
40|$|Fructan {{synthesis}} was induced in excised {{primary leaf}} blades of Hordeum vulgare L. cv Gerbel by illumination in 30 millimolar fructose. This treatment induced a 26 -fold increase of sucrose-sucrose-fructosyltransferase (SST, EC 2. 4. 1. 99) activity within 24 hours. Acid invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) activity remained about constant. By preparing protoplasts from induced leaves, approximately 80 % of the invertase activity was removed with the cell walls while SST was retained. The protoplast homogenate {{was used to}} partially purify and characterize SST. Acid precipitation (pH 4. 75) and anion exchange chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono `Q') resulted in a recovery of about 80 % of total SST activity. The principal activity (SST 1), accounting for 85 % of the activity recovered, was purified about 200 -fold. It was essentially free of invertase activity and catalyzed the synthesis of a trisaccharide which co-chromatographed with <b>isokestose</b> (1 F-β-fructosylsucrose). The remaining 15 % of SST activity (SST 2) was purified about 35 -fold. It retained substantial invertase activity and catalyzed the synthesis of only one trisaccharide which co-chromatographed with kestose (6 F-β-fructosylsucrose). It is concluded that barley leaves which store mainly fructan of the phlein type (β- 2 - 6 polyfructosylsucrose), nevertheless contain sucrose-sucrose 1 F-β-d-fructosyltransferase as the key enzyme of fructan synthesis...|$|E
