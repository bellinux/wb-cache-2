Norepinephrine, which is involved in arousal, comes <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus. Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E

5|$|After Marius, {{the legions}} were drawn largely from {{volunteer}} citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty. Volunteers {{came forward and}} were accepted not from citizens {{of the city of}} Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control. Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as veterans, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns. The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from {{similarly}} aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E
5|$|In {{a process}} known as the Marian reforms, Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a {{programme}} of reform of the Roman military. In 107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service. The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> the Roman aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|Legends of vampires {{have existed}} for millennia; {{cultures}} {{such as the}} Mesopotamians, Hebrews, ancient Greeks, and Romans had tales of demonic entities and blood-drinking spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity we know today as the vampire originates almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> early 18th-century Southeastern Europe, particularly Transylvania as verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire itself. Belief in such legends became so rife that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.|$|E
5|$|The size of Chnodomar's cavalry is unknown, but was {{probably}} {{a small proportion of}} the total, as the Alamanni's heavily forested land was not suited to large-scale cavalry operations. Most of the Alamanni horsemen were noblemen and their retainers, as only they could afford to keep a warhorse. Chnodomar's cavalry is unlikely to have exceeded 1,750 horse in total, assuming that the cavalry element was similar to the 7% cavalry element in the early Roman citizen legion, as the latter was also recruited <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> the wealthiest classes.|$|E
5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato onions, {{also referred to}} as multiplier onions. The bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>from</b> daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
