Presentation of caseWe present {{the case of a}} patient whose CT scan of the abdomen showed a large mass, 11 × 8 cm, arising retro-duodenal and lying just anterior to the right kidney. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case where the accessory spleen was found retro-duodenal, directly anterior to the kidney and completely separate from the supra-renal gland.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} incision {{is determined by}} access to the surgical field, particularly when an oncological resection is required. Special consideration is also given to other factors, such as postoperative pain and its sequelae, fewer complications in the early postoperative period and a lower occurrence of incisional hernias. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the right Kocher’s and the midline incision, for patients undergoing right hemicolectomy, by focusing on short- and longterm results. Methods Between 1995 and 2009, hospital records for 213 patients that had undergone a right hemicolectomy for a right- sided adenocarcinoma were retrospectively studied. 113 patients had been operated via a Kocher’s and 100 via a midline incision. Demographic details, operative data (explorative access to the peritoneal cavity, time of operation), recovery parameters (time with IV analgesic medication, time to first oral fluid intake, time to first solid meal, time to discharge), and oncological parameters (lymph node harvest, TNM stage and resection margins) were analyzed. Postoperative complications were also recorded. The two groups were retrospectively well matched with respect to demographic parameters and oncological status of the tumor. Results The median length of the midline incision was slightly longer (12 vs. 10 [*]cm, p[*] Conclusions The <b>Kocher’s</b> <b>incision</b> approach for right- sided colon cancer is technically feasible, safe and overall very well tolerated.

40|$|New, modern {{devices for}} tissue {{resection}} {{have been introduced}} in the surgical treatment of thyroid diseases recent years. Aim: To present our experience {{with the use of}} the harmonic scalpel in thyroid surgery. Patients and methods: For the period 2008 - 2011, 1398 patients (6 to 74 years old) with various thyroid deseases were operated on in our clinic. The resection was performed through a classic <b>Kocher,s</b> collar <b>incision</b> in 583 patients, using minimally ivasive open access in 641 patients and with video-assisted technique in 174 patients. In all patients a harmonic scalpel device (Ethicon Endosurgery Care Inc) has been used. The length of surgical incision, use of haemostatic instruments and ligatures, extent of resection, need of draining, operative time, intra- and postoperative complications, length of postoperative hospital stay have been examined. Results: The volume of resection ranged from istmusectomy to total thyroidectomy. During all operation haemostatic instruments and ligatures have not been used. Lack of bleeding and shortend operating time - up to 45 % were found. The use of draining is significantly reduced, regardless of the extent of resection. There was no increase in the incidence of intra- and postoperative complications. Тhe postoperative stay was significantly reduced.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONIn {{endemic goitre}} areas, 20 % of the {{population}} over 70 will have retrosternal goitre. 12 Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) occurs when there are repeated episodes of complete or partial blockage of the upper airway during sleep. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 55 -year-old man was being treated for obstructive sleep apnoea, came with stridor worsening over the 2 and was advised CPAP ventilation. In our institution, he was diagnosed to have goitre with retrosternal extension with no hypo/hyperthyroidism. He was an obese (BMI – 30 Kg/m 2) male with a short, broad neck and clinically no obvious swelling in the neck. He had stridor, with positive Kocher's test as well as Pemberton's sign. His TFT's were normal and CT scan revealed widening of superior mediastinum. Patient was pre-medicated with low dose (0. 1 μg) fentanyl, and induced with inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflourane). Endotracheal intubation was done using 6 no. ET tube, without muscle relaxation, and the thyroid was removed through a conventional <b>Kocher's</b> <b>incision.</b> Thyroid was enlarged 25 cm by 10 cm in retrosternal position. Postoperatively, pt was reversed and shifted to ICU, was monitored for the next 24 hours. He was extubated uneventfully the next morning. Patient had a good post-op recovery and was discharged on the 7 th post-op day. DISCUSSIONTerms such as retrosternal, substernal, intrathoracic, or mediastinal {{have been used to}} describe a goitre that extends beyond the thoracic inlet. However, {{there is a lack of}} consensus regarding the exact definition of a retrosternal goitre (RSG). 1 The majority of patients present with shortness of breath or asthma like symptoms (68. 8 %), as was the case in the studied patient. Other modes of presentation include neck mass (75 %), hoarseness of voice (37. 5 %), dysphagia (31. 3 %), stridor/wheezing (19 %), or SVC obstruction. Upper airway obstruction due to thyroid gland has been reported up to 31 % 2 and difficulty in intubation has been reported in 11 %. 3 Central airway obstruction produces symptoms of dyspnoea, stridor, or obstructive pneumonia and is often misdiagnosed as asthma. 4 The CT scan was the most useful tool showing the nature and extent of the lesion in the reported case. In a recent publication, the CT scan was considered the gold-standard preoperative radiological investigation. 5 Surgery is the only effective treatment for retrosternal goitres. In most cases, suppressive therapy with thyroxine is ineffective in reducing the size of multinodular goitres; 7, 8 radio-iodine therapy is both generally ineffective in large goitres 8 and may induce acute inflammation and swelling of the gland with the potential for airway obstruction. The operation of choice is usually a total thyroidectomy. Only around 2 % of patients undergoing thyroidectomy for retrosternal goitre will require surgical access other than a standard collar incision (either manubriotomy, sternotomy or thoracotomy). 9 CONCLUSIONDespite all the advances in investigative modalities, retrosternal goitre still exists in 20 % of patients over 70 years in endemic regions. It has to be recognised that it can be a cause of obstructive sleep apnoea. Early detection and prompt management goes a long way in decreasing the morbidity and mortality in patients with RSG...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bochdalek hernia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} abnormalities manifested in infants. In the adult is a rarity, with a prevalence of 0. 17 - 6 % of all diaphragmatic hernias. Right-sided Bochdalek hernias containing colon are even more rare, with no case described in the literature with ileo-cecal appendix. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The authors present a case of a right-sided Bochdalek hernia in an adult female of 49 years old, presented with severe respiratory failure. During laparotomy for hernia correction, were found in an intrathoracic position the cecum and ileo-cecal appendix, the right colon and the transverse colon. DISCUSSION: Although useful in patient evaluation, clinical history and physical examination are not helpful in making diagnosis because of their nonspecific character. CT scan is the most accurate exam for making diagnosis. Most of the times there is no hernial sac. Surgery is the treatment of choice, and it is always indicated even if asymptomatic. In general suture of the defect is possible. Due to patient's weak respiratory function we chose laparotomy by <b>Kocher</b> <b>incision.</b> CONCLUSION: Being the first case of a right-sided Bochdalek hernia in the adult with a herniated ileo-cecal appendix, we name it Almeida-Reis hernia...|$|E
40|$|As a rule, these {{operations}} require {{the placement of}} one or more drains in the thyroid place. In recent years, new methods have been introduced in the field of thyroid surgery, such as minimally invasive, video-assisted and open approach techniques, with different access points. They all aim to minimize thyroid tissue trauma while preserving comparable efficiency and safety and providing better cosmetic results 1, 2, 3, 4. The implementation of these new techniques is linked with the development of new methods for tissue dissection and ligation of blood vessels such as harmonic scalpel and argon-plasma coagulator. The objective of the current work is to present our experience with the use of harmonic scalpel in the surgery of thyroid gland. PATIENTS AND METHODS For the period from 2008 to 2011, 1398 patients at the age between 6 to 74 years, with various thyroid deseases were operated on in our clinic. The resection was performed through a classic Kocher’s collar incision in 583 patients, using minimally ivasive open access in 641 patients and with video-assisted method in 174 patients (table. 1).

40|$|Hypothesis: To {{describe}} an alternative lateral neck access {{in order to}} perform neck dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with lymph node involvement. Design: Prospective (January 2000 to December 2003), 36 -month study. Setting: Catholic University of Rome and University of "Tor Vergata", Rome, Italy. Patients and methods: Twenty-four consecutive patients with PTC and cervical lymph node metastases were included. Functional neck dissection (FND), unilateral or bilateral, was performed acceding via a lateral dissection through a traditional <b>Kocher</b> <b>incision,</b> running along the superficial fascia of the neck and posteriorly to the sternocleidomastoideus muscle. Results: Mean age was 39. 04 +/- 13. 69 years. Twenty patients were women and four were men. Mean tumour size was 2. 5 +/- 1 cm, while the greatest metastatic lymph node size was 4. 5 cm. Minimally invasive, selective FND was performed in all patients associated to total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymph node clearance. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 142 out of 340 of the lymph nodes dissected. Conclusions: Minimally invasive neck dissection seems to carry a lower risk in terms of specific morbidity and allows a quicker recovery and a better aesthetic result. This access has to {{be considered as a}} less invasive procedure compared to the other surgical accesses for the radical or modified lateral neck dissection...|$|E
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of thyroid diseases with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) can present {{a challenge in}} the clinical diagnosis and management for these patients. This study aims to determine the frequency of coexisting thyroid gland lesions in a consecutive series patients with PHPT, and to analyze the clinical features, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these patients. Twenty-two cases of a total of 52 PHPT patients who had synchronous thyroid and parathyroid pathology were surgically managed in this study. Thirteen patients had ipsilateral thyroid nodules, and 9 patients had thyroid nodules in contralateral or bilateral side. Seven patients underwent direct parathyroidectomy and hemithyroidectomy via a mini-incision (about 3 cm), while other 15 procedures were converted to <b>Kocher</b> <b>incision.</b> Seventeen nodular goiter (32. 7 %), 2 thyroiditis (3. 8 %), 2 thyroid adenoma (3. 8 %) and 1 thyroid carcinoma (1. 9 %) coexisting with parathyroid adenoma were pathologically diagnosed. The sensitivity of preoperative ultrasonography (US) and methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) scintigraphy for parathyroid lesions was 63. 6 % and 85. 7 %; and the overall positive predictive values for MIBI and US were 100 % and 95. 5 % respectively. A high incidence of thyroid diseases that coexisted with PHPT in literatures was briefly reviewed. Our study illustrated the need for clinical awareness of concomitant PHPT and thyroid disease. A combination of US, computed tomography (CT) and MIBI scintigraphy would be recommended for preoperative localization of enlarged parathyroid adenoma and for evaluation of thyroid lesions. Synchronous treatment of associated thyroid abnormalities is desirable, and open minimally invasive surgical approach with additional resection of isolated ipsilateral thyroid nodules is possible in some of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{incision}} {{used for}} thyroid surgery has become shorter over time, from the classical 10 [*]cm long <b>Kocher</b> <b>incision</b> to the shortest 15 [*]mm access achieved with Minimally Invasive Video-Assisted Thyroidectomy. This rather large interval encompasses many different possible technical choices, {{even if we}} just consider open surgery. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the correlation between incision length and operation duration with a set of biometric and clinical factors and establish a rationale for the decision on the length of incision in open surgery. Methods Ninety-seven consecutive patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy were prospectively evaluated. All operations were performed by the same team and the surgeon decided the length of the incision according to his personal judgement. Patients who had previously undergone neck surgery were excluded. Results The length of the incision was strongly correlated with gender, thyroid volume, neck circumference and clinical diagnosis and weakly correlated with the body mass index. Operation duration was only weakly correlated with gender and neck circumference. Multiple linear regression revealed that the set of factors assessed explained almost 60 [*]% of the variance in incision length but only 20 [*]% of the variance in operation duration. When patients were classified according to the distribution of their thyroid volume, cases within one standard deviation of the mean did not show a significant difference in terms of operation duration with incisions of various lengths. Conclusions Although thyroid volume was a major factor in driving the decision with respect to the length of the incision, our study shows that it had only minor effect on the duration of the operation. Many more open thyroidectomies could therefore be safely performed with shorter incisions, especially in women. Duration of the operation is probably more closely linked to the inherent technical difficulty of each case. </p...|$|E
