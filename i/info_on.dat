25|$|Part of {{what makes}} the flapamba’s {{characteristic}} sound is the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not tuned to the bars as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any <b>info</b> <b>on</b> the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E

But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kano, {{the editor}} in chief of Rockin'On Japan, he stated that the lyrical content {{discusses}} themes of mystery and daily life actions; he furthered believed that the song's lyrics is an open interpretation, due to its lack of major characteristics and identified philosophy and religion as examples. In an interview that promoted her fifth Japanese studio album Ultra Blue (2005) and her single [...] "Passion", which is the follow to [...] "Hikari", Utada felt the writing process was difficult. She believed that the plot to Kingdom Hearts was soulless, and was unable to become inspired by it to write the song. She further explained; [...] "when I was making the song 'Hikari', the whole outlook for the game and its entry onto the world was so crucial that I got a lot more <b>info</b> <b>on</b> the characters (so that 'Hikari' would mirror the image that they wanted)." ...|$|E

500|$|Ken Barnes from USA Today {{noted that}} major events in Madonna's life were {{repeated}} throughout the book. He complimented O'Brien's writing style, especially the portions chronicling {{the death of}} Madonna's mother, as well as dissecting the recording process of the albums {{and the development of}} her concert tours. He concluded by saying that overall the biography seemed [...] "too familiar. Maybe that's because, at least since she hit the mass-culture spotlight in 1983 with 'Holiday' and hijacked it wholesale the next year with 'Like a Virgin' and 'Material Girl', Madonna, now 49, has lived her life in public like few other artists. The records, tours and videos have been thoroughly documented, as have the liaisons and the controversies (from the Sex book {{all the way up to}} the Malawi orphan adoption)." [...] Lyn Barber from The Daily Telegraph gave a negative review of the book, calling it far inferior to author J. Randy Taraborrelli's , released in 2002. Like Churchwell, Barber did not understand why over-emphasis was given on the singer's albums, leaving out details about her personal life. The reviewer listed one positive aspect of the book, the <b>info</b> <b>on</b> Madonna's childhood and a detailed insight into her family. She concluded by saying, [...] " [...] remains one of the most fascinating women of our time but not, alas, in this pedestrian account." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hero" [...] was {{the subject}} of two {{copyright}} plagiarism cases; one by Christopher Selletti and the other by Rhonda Dimmie, filed in 1993 and 1996. Selletti claimed he had written the song's lyrics {{in the form of a}} poem. One day, as he drove Sly Stone in a limousine to Long Island, he claimed to have shown him the poem. Selletti claimed Stone complimented the poem, taking it and promising to patent it and earn him royalties. After many months, the pair fell out of contact, leading Selletti to mail himself the envelope and poem, performing a [...] "poor man's copyright." [...] Three years later in 1996, he claimed to have listened to Carey's album Music Box and was shocked when he noted the song's similar lyrics. He filed a lawsuit against Carey, Stone, Sony and Stone's manager Jerry Goldstein. Selletti claimed that Stone must have sold or contributed the lyrics to Carey during the recording of the album in late 1992. However, since Stone did not receive songwriting credits on [...] "Hero", Selletti then dropped the suit against Stone, leaving him against Carey and Sony. Prior to their court room meeting, Carey told New York Daily News [...] "I feel totally victimized. 'Hero' is my creation and it holds a very special meaning to me. I have every intention of fighting this all the way." [...] In court, Carey provided evidence to her innocence, in the form of a dated lyrical and music notebook, with conceptual <b>info</b> <b>on</b> the song dated back to November 20, 1992, prior to Selletti's meeting with Stone. Additionally, Carey stated the fact that she had originally written it for the film Hero alongside Afanasieff, making their connection or the involvement of his material impossible. Judge Denny Chin found Carey innocent, and ordered Selletti to pay her a fine.|$|E
