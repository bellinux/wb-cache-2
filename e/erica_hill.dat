Much was made of the historic nature of her hiring; Falsone herself noted that she was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from the public, while also saying that [...] "it's surprising it's taken until 2011 for this to happen". Falsone {{has been the subject of}} several profiles in recent years, including a segment with <b>Erica</b> <b>Hill</b> on the Today and a segment on the NBC Nightly News. While she has faced gender-based criticism, mostly on the Internet and social media, Falsone has also been surprised by the number of young female fans she has who see her as a role model.|$|E
5000|$|From 1999 to 2002, Chen was {{the anchor}} of CBS Morning News and news anchor of CBS This Morning and later The Early Show, {{alongside}} Bryant Gumbel, Jane Clayson, Hannah Storm, Harry Smith, Maggie Rodriguez, <b>Erica</b> <b>Hill,</b> and Rene Syler.

Before CBS News, she was a reporter and weekend anchor at WCBS-TV in New York City.Since 2000, she has also been {{the host of the}} American version of Big Brother. During the first season (2000), Chen was widely criticized in the media for her heavily scripted, wooden delivery in her interaction with the studio audience and in the interviews on the live programs, earning her the nickname [...] "Chenbot." [...] She has indicated in two separate interviews, that she takes no personal offense to the term, adding that it may derive from her [...] "precise on-air style" [...] which comes from [...] "a desire to be objective". She again acknowledged the nickname while discussing mugs made in her likeness when she proudly proclaimed, [...] "I am the Chenbot!" [...] in a segment on The Early Show.|$|E
5000|$|Animal burials {{date back}} to {{prehistory}} with examples emerging from the Mesolithic period. In Sweden at the burial site Skateholm I dogs were found buried with children under eight years old or were found buried by themselves. Some of the dogs who were buried alone have grave goods similar to their human contemporaries such as flint weapons and deer antlers. Meanwhile, {{during the same time}} period Skateholm II emerged and was very different than Skateholm I, as dogs were buried along on the North and West boundaries of the grave area. [...] Another burial site in Siberia near Lake Biakal known as the [...] "Lokomotiv" [...] cemetery had a wolf burials among human graves. Buried together with, but slightly beneath the wolf was a male human skull. The wolf breed was not native to this area as it was warm and other research for the area shows no other wolf habitation. [...] Bazaliiskiy & Savelyev suggests that the presence and significance of the wolf could possibly reflect human interaction. Another example occurred in 300 B.C. in Pazyryk known as the Pazyryk burials where ten horses were buried alongside a human male, the horses were fully adorned with saddles, pendants, among other valuables. The oldest horse as also the horse with the grandest attachments. <b>Erica</b> <b>Hill,</b> a professor in archaeology, suggests that the burials of prehistory animals can shed light on human-animal relationships.|$|E
