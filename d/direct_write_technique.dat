5000|$|DPN is a <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> <b>technique</b> {{so it can}} be {{used for}} {{top-down}} and bottom-up lithography applications. In top-down work, the tips are used to deliver an etch resist to a surface, which is followed by a standard etching process.

5000|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The {{reason for this}} {{has more to do}} with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, microcontact printing (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to microcontact printing. The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> <b>technique</b> that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply microcontact printing to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, microcontact printing would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. [...] The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography. No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be [...] "too slow". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography is slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by microcontact printing.|$|E

This thesis studies {{the feasibility of}} {{femtosecond laser}} written array waveguide gratings (AWG) {{with an interest in}} astronomical applications. AWGs have recently been studied as a new integrated alternative to the current generation of astronomical spectographs. AWGs have the advantage of being small, robust and stable - all important factors sought after in astronomical instrumentation. One setback for the use of AWGs in astronomy is that current fabrication techniques are expensive and hard to prototype, making development of such devices difficult. This feasibility study has explored the possibility of fabricating AWGs using a laser <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> <b>technique</b> that is cheap and allows for fast design prototype. The femtosecond laser <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> <b>technique</b> uses a focused high powered laser to produce a localised refractive index change in a glass substrate which is typically used to form waveguides. To fabricate AWGs using the laser writing technique, the capability to inscribe large smooth planar waveguides that act as a 2 D free propagation zones were evaluated. Once a suitable slab fabrication method was established a laser written AWG proto-type was produced with initial output showing a degree of correlation to the theoretical output at a single wave- length. From this initial proto-type design improvements were made to improve the device, however initial results shows that laser written AWGs are highly susceptible to phase array error which could affect the feasibility of laser written AWGs. This initial study shows that laser written AWGs could have future applications in telecommunications and integrated spectroscopic sensors when phase errors are minimised.

Disc structure is formed where its dimension is affected by the laser fluence. We found that polymer processing using this technique can be categorized into three stages. In the first stage (fluence > 90 J/cm 2), lens shaped structure is formed with linear increase in diameter with logarithmic increase in laser fluence. In second stage (fluence > 600 J/cm 2), flat-top disc structure is formed and the increase in disc diameter slows down with increasing laser fluence. In the third stage (fluence > 49 kJ/cm 2), crater is formed at the centre of the disc due to laser ablation. Moreover, relatively large exposure fluence above the value required for complete polymerization has allowed collateral thermal-polymerization of the surrounding of the disc structure and reduced aspect ratio of the structure. Hence, by controlling laser writing fluence, different structures mentioned above can be produced.

This present thesis is a study on the feasibility of PBW in p-type GaAs, and compares experimental results with computer simulations using the Atlas(c) semiconductor device package from SILVACO. It has been established that hole transport is required for the electrochemical etching of GaAs using Tiron (4, 5 -Dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonic acid, di-sodium salt). PBW in GaAs results in carrier removal in the irradiated regions and consequently minimal hole transport (in these regions) during electrochemical etching. As a result the irradiated regions are significantly more etch resistant than the non-irradiated regions.
