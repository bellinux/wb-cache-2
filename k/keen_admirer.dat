25|$|Silas {{returns to}} Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison {{under the name}} Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is {{revealed}} that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the Gloved Hand Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas to back off and never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined {{to find out who}} the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared {{during the time of the}} murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of her good work and to keep it up, implying that he knows she is the real killer.|$|E

500|$|The four valses-caprices {{are not a}} cycle, {{but rather}} two sets of two, [...] the first [...] from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four [...] "more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and {{comments}} that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting {{in and out of}} unexpected keys. [...] Aaron Copland, though generally a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of Fauré's music, wrote, [...] "the several Valses-Caprices, in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's esprit.

In March, 1902, the composer accompanied Olga to Saint Petersburg, in order to deepen her knowledge of Russian language and to let her become familiar with Russian life and society. His brother František worked there as a teacher. A month later, Olga fell ill with typhoid fever. Her health deteriorated rapidly, and she was forced to return to Brno in July of the same year. After her return, she spent some time in Hukvaldy in order to recuperate; however, her illness reappeared with new and worse complications. After months of suffering, Olga Janáčková died on 26 February 1903.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} attacks on Dryden's {{reputation}} was by Wordsworth, who complained that Dryden's descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals. However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden's works), were still <b>keen</b> <b>admirers</b> of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous [...] "Intimations of Immortality" [...] ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's [...] "Alexander's Feast". John Keats admired the [...] "Fables", and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as [...] "classics of our prose." [...] He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to {{take an interest in}} Dryden was T. S. Eliot, who wrote that he was [...] "the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century", and that [...] "we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden." [...] However, in the same essay, Eliot accused Dryden of having a [...] "commonplace mind". Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently, but, as a relatively straightforward writer (William Empson, another modern admirer of Dryden, compared his [...] "flat" [...] use of language with Donne's interest in the [...] "echoes and recesses of words"), his work has not occasioned as much interest as Andrew Marvell's, John Donne's or Pope's.|$|R
2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs for the Deaf was {{the first}} Queens of the Stone Age album that {{featured}} Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters on drums, who also toured with the band. He replaced the previous drummer, Gene Trautmann, who started working on other projects. Grohl had been a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of Queens of the Stone Age since the band opened for Foo Fighters on tour and originally wanted to appear on Rated R. He joined Queens of the Stone Age in October 2001 when he {{received a phone call}} from Josh Homme with whom he had been friends since 1992, while Homme was the guitarist for Kyuss. Grohl admitted that he had not drummed for a long time and added that fronting a band was [...] "tiring". Grohl put Foo Fighters on temporary hiatus, delaying their upcoming album One by One to October 22, 2002 because of touring duties in support of the album. Grohl's first performance with the band occurred at March 7, 2002 at The Troubadour, Los Angeles, and his last performance was at the Fuji Rock Festival on July 28, 2002. He returned to Foo Fighters soon after, with Danzig drummer Joey Castillo eventually announced as his long-term replacement in August 2002.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, he {{was spotted}} by scouts from Troyes, he was {{subsequently}} {{brought into the}} youth academy from RC Paris. Whilst playing for the youth team {{there was a significant}} amount of <b>keen</b> <b>admirers</b> interested in him. A number of clubs such as Lens and Nantes were very keen on him. In 2001, having spent three seasons playing with the youth team and because of the level of interest, the president of Troyes offered Ziani a five-year deal, which in turn was his first professional contract. With Ziani agreeing to a five-year deal, he was immediately promoted to the senior squad by Alain Perrin at the age of 17 and was assigned the number 17 shirt. He made his professional debut on 8 December 2001 against SC Bastia coming on as a substitute, replacing David Hamed in the seventy-second minute of the game. After making a few substitute appearances, he made his first start on 3 March 2002 in a 1-0 loss to Lille playing the full length of the game. He played a total of 8 games in the 2001-02 season. He became more of a regular in the 2002-03 season as he participated in a total of 24 games. After subsequently spending two seasons playing for Troyes in Ligue 1, the club was relegated to Ligue 2 {{at the end of the}} 2002-03 season. Whilst in Ligue 2, during the 2003-04 season, Ziani played 28 games in total and scored his first professional goal against FC Rouen, in the 9th minute with the score ending 3-0. He spent the following season mostly on the bench for Troyes and with interest from other clubs being shown, Troyes had decided to part ways with Ziani. Turkish club Rivaspor had made a bid but could not negotiate a contract with Ziani, as Ziani had put in a condition which Rivaspor rejected. Ziani revealed the condition merely as having Madjid Bougherra have a trial with the club to display his qualities as they had both travelled to Turkey and Ziani would have liked a compatriot with him at the club as he was only 19 at the time. When Rivaspor rejected the condition, both Ziani and Bougherra left Turkey together.|$|R

50|$|Baba Sam's {{career in}} the colonial {{administration}} began with his appointment by the Dutch East India Company in 1772 as Ronggo, or district head, of Besuki under the Javanese name of Soemodiwirjo. He obtained this post thanks to the intercession of his powerful uncle, Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen of Surabaya and pachter, or leaseholder, of the district of Besuki. In 1776, Baba Sam was promoted to the higher position of Tumanggung of Bangil with the successive noble titles of Ngabehi Soero Widjojo (1776 - 1788) and Tumanggung Soero Adinegoro (1788 - 1808).

50|$|Five {{months after}} Clairefontaine's opening, manager Henri Michel was fired {{following}} a 1-1 away draw with Cyprus in qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The firing of Michel propelled the influential Claude Bez, {{who was president}} of football club Bordeaux, {{into the role of}} superintendent for the French team, a position made especially for him. Bez, who was a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of Platini, sought the former player's services and hired him on 1 November 1988 as manager of the team. Upon arrival, Platini was given the task of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, as well as introducing younger players like Eric Cantona, Laurent Blanc, and Didier Deschamps alongside veterans Manuel Amoros, Joël Bats, and Jean Tigana. In Platini's first match in charge, France lost 2-3 to Yugoslavia. France had been up 2-1 with 15 minutes remaining before Yugoslavia scored in the 76th and 82nd minute. In France's next qualification match, the team were beaten by Scotland and, in the following match, drew 0-0 with Yugoslavia. Through four matches, the team had only accumulated two points, preventing them from qualifying for the 1990 World Cup.|$|E
50|$|Most of Ward's works {{deal with}} the issue of rural housing and the {{problems}} of overpopulation and planning regulations in Britain to which he proposed anarchistic solutions. He was a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of architect Walter Segal who set up a ‘build it yourself’ system in Lewisham meaning that land that was too small or difficult to build on conventionally was given to people who with Segal’s help would build their own homes. Ward was very keen on the idea of ‘build it yourself’ having said in response to the proposition of removing all planning laws, ‘I don't believe in just letting it rip, the rich get away with murder when that happens. But I do want the planning system to be flexible enough to give homeless people a chance’. In his book Cotters and Squatters, Ward described the historical development of informal customs to appropriate land for housing which frequently grew up in opposition to legally constituted systems of land ownership. Ward described folkways in many cultures which parallel the Welsh tradition of the Tŷ unnos or 'one night house' erected on common land.|$|E

50|$|While {{assessing}} ancient literature, Lovato characterized three features which {{mark the}} development of humanism: an appetite for classical texts; a philological concern to correct them and ascertain their meaning, {{and a desire to}} imitate them. Noted by Petrarch, it was Lovato's study of law which introduced him to the ancient literature. However while drawing on ancient Roman sources for their own work, Lovato and his disciple Albertino Mussato, showed little interest in investigating the nature of the society, that produced them. Lovato's poetry exposed his confused notion of the ancient past, where Greek and Roman history and mythology mingle without distinction as their basis in reality. Yet, Lovati's success demonstrated his profound intensive study of ancient law, vocabulary and phraseology. His stylistic accomplishments, and ability to imitate ancient Latin, suggest that he was at least making a beginning of establishing an emotional and intellectual contact with a segment of the ancient experience. A <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of the Roman dramatist Seneca, Lovato demonstrated his clear understanding of metrical structure of ancient Latin poetry, later producing the earliest Renaissance treatise on metrics. He wrote a short account of Senecan meters, illustrating Latin poet's preference for two verse patterns, the pentameter and the hexameter. In his letters, Lovato strives to match classical vocabulary, meter and tone, revealing a strong emphasis of grammatical components towards the literary movement. Evidently, Lovato only reformed his poetry, leaving his prose untouched. Unlike his poetry, Lovato's Dictamina borrowed few phrases from ancient authors, not erecting the effect of ancient prose. This bifurcation of Lovato's work is characteristic of the literary movement he pioneered for the first forty years.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 February 1984, France {{defeated}} England 2-0 at the Parc des Princes. The match {{marked the}} inauguration of the [...] "carré magique" [...] {{as it was the}} first time all four players, Platini, Giresse, Tigana, and Fernández, started a match together. Hidalgo was a <b>keen</b> <b>admirer</b> of the 4-4-2 formation and used all four players perfectly, placing Tigana and Fernández in defensive midfield roles to act as deep-lying playmakers, inserted Giresse on the wings in order to utilise his small, agile frame, and placing Platini, now of Juventus fame and nationally recognised, into the playmaker position just behind the striker, who was usually Dominique Rocheteau, Bernard Lacombe or Didier Six.Since France hosted UEFA Euro 1984, they played numerous friendly matches to prepare themselves for the tournament. The expectations in the country were high heading into the competition with the team entering the Euros having gone unbeaten in eleven of the twelve friendly matches, with their only loss coming in a 1-3 defeat by the Danes in Copenhagen. France avenged this defeat in the opening match of the Euros defeating the Danish 1-0 with France's only goal coming from Michel Platini, the ball deflecting off of the head of Dane defender Søren Busk. In the following group stage match, France recorded a 5-0 victory over Belgium with Platini getting a hat trick. Magic Square members Giresse and Fernández also scored. In the final group stage match, Platini scored another hat trick outscoring the Yugoslavians 3-2. In the semi-final, France faced Portugal at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille and scored a goal from Jean-François Domergue in the 25th minute. Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão and the match went into extra time at 1-1. In extra time, Portugal began the scoring, again through Jordão, in the 98th minute. In the second half of extra time, France equalised with Domergue scoring again in the 115th minute, his only two international goals. Four minutes later, France got the game-winning goal through Michel Platini, who scored following a run into the box by Tigana. France had qualified for their first ever major international final.|$|E
