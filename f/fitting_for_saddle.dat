40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Lagrange-multiplier {{formulation}} of discrete constrained optimization problems, the associated discrete-space first-order necessary and sufficient conditions <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> points, and an efficient first-order search procedure that looks <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> points in discrete space. Our new theory provides a strong mathematical foundation for solving general nonlinear discrete optimization problems. Specifically, we propose a new vector-based definition of descent directions in discrete space and show that the new definition does not obey the rules of calculus in continuous space. Starting from the concept of saddle points and using only vector calculus, we then prove the discrete-space first-order necessary and sufficient conditions <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> points. Using well-defined transformations on the constraint functions, we further prove that the set of discrete-space saddle points {{is the same as}} the set of constrained local minima, leading to the first-order necessary and suf [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The Monterufoli pony is an {{endangered}} Tuscan breed. In the 80 ’s began {{a project for}} the conservation of the breed and at present there are roughly 200 individuals. The equine was once utilized <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> and driving and this study deals with the training for these two aptitudes. The mor- phologic type of the pony seems suited <b>for</b> <b>saddle,</b> in particular <b>for</b> children and beginners, and driving. The ponies showed developed chest, strong legs with short shanks: all these characters were useful for trot and driving. In this trial 3 - 4 years old never tamed Monterufoli ponies were opportunely choose and subsequently trained <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> and driving. The ponies were submitted to the “aptitude test” for the two aptitudes and the results were good both for practical and character sides. The marks for sad- dle and driving were 8. 16 and 8. 06 respectively. Also the 3 ponies showed good results for the Aptitude Index: 7. 60, 7. 87 and 7. 89. The results of the trial showed the excellent ability of the Monterufoli pony <b>for</b> <b>saddle</b> and driving. The good results of the test are important for the diffusion of the breed in the territory and in particular in horse centres and in equestrian tourism sites...|$|R
