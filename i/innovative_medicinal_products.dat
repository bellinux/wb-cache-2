50|$|The rapid {{development}} in the multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering {{has resulted in a}} variety of new and <b>innovative</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> often carrying living cells, intended to repair, regenerate or replace damaged human tissue. Tissue engineered medicinal products (TEMPs) vary in terms of the type and origin of cells and the product’s complexity. As all medicinal products, the safety and efficacy of TEMPs must be consistent throughout the manufacturing process. Quality control and assurance are of paramount importance and products are constantly assessed throughout the manufacturing process to ensure their safety, efficacy, consistency and reproducibility between batches. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for the development, assessment and supervision of medicines in the EU. The appointed committees are involved in referral procedures concerning safety or the balance of benefit/risk of a medicinal product. In addition, the committees organize inspections with regards to the conditions under which medicinal products are being manufactured. For example, the compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP), good clinical practice (GCP), good laboratory practice (GLP) and pharmacovigilance (PhV).|$|E

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> {{that contains a}} version of the active substance of an original biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or <b>innovative</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity.

In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from public expenditures. The correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and with the classification lists of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The research has confirmed the association of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The explanatory variables included in the regression model for the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> explained up to 94 % of variability in the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire.
