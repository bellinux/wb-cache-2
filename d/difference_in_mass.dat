5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass,</b> the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> {{between the}} two {{hydrogen}} isotopes translates into {{a difference in the}} zero-point energy and thus into a slight difference in the speed of the reaction. Once HDO becomes a significant fraction of the water, heavy water becomes more prevalent as water molecules trade hydrogen atoms very frequently. Production of pure heavy water by distillation or electrolysis requires a large cascade of stills or electrolysis chambers and consumes large amounts of power, so the chemical methods are generally preferred.|$|E
40|$|Variations in {{specific}} heat ratio, flow angle, critical velocity ratio, swirl distribution exponent, and radius ratio were considered <b>in</b> computing the <b>mass</b> flow. Variations <b>in</b> specific heat ratio had no significant effect and variations in critical velocity ratio had only small effect on computed mass flow between a one- and two-dimensional analysis. All non-free-vortex cases considered showed larger <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> computed <b>mass</b> flow between one- and two-dimensional analysis than for free vortex flow. For the non-free-vortex cases, decreasing radius ratio and increasing flow angle resulted <b>in</b> larger <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> flow as computed {{by the two}} methods...|$|R

50|$|Measurement {{of natural}} {{variations}} in the abundances of stable isotopes of the same element is normally referred to as stable isotope analysis. This field is of interest because the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> between different isotopes leads to isotope fractionation, causing measurable effects on the isotopic composition of samples, characteristic of their biological or physical history.|$|R
500|$|Diffusion {{within the}} firn layer causes other changes {{that can be}} measured. [...] Gravity causes heavier {{molecules}} to be enriched {{at the bottom of}} a gas column, with the amount of enrichment depending on the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> between the molecules. [...] Colder temperatures cause heavier molecules to be more enriched {{at the bottom of a}} column. [...] These fractionation processes in trapped air, determined by the measurement of the / ratio and of neon, krypton and xenon, have been used to infer the thickness of the firn layer, and determine other palaeoclimatic information such as past mean ocean temperatures. [...] Some gases such as helium can rapidly diffuse through ice, so it may be necessary to test for these [...] "fugitive gases" [...] within minutes of the core being retrieved to obtain accurate data. [...] Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which contribute to the greenhouse effect and also cause ozone loss in the stratosphere, can be detected in ice cores after about 1950; almost all CFCs in the atmosphere were created by human activity.|$|E
2500|$|In nuclear physics, {{nuclear fusion}} is a {{reaction}} {{in which two}} or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons).

2500|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} {{predicts that}} if {{it is possible for}} a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so. This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass,</b> the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself.

50|$|Uranium {{enrichment}} {{is difficult}} because the chemical properties of 235U and 238U are identical, so physical processes such as gaseous diffusion, gas centrifuge or mass spectrometry must be used for isotopic separation based on small <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass.</b> Because enrichment is the main technical hurdle to production of nuclear fuel and simple nuclear weapons, enrichment technology is politically sensitive.|$|R
5|$|Dalton {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain}} why water absorbed different gases in different proportions - for example, he found that water absorbed carbon dioxide far better than it absorbed nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass</b> and complexity of the gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|R

2500|$|The {{difference}} between the g-factors of the muon and the electron is due to their <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass.</b> [...] Because of the muon's larger mass, contributions to the theoretical calculation of its anomalous magnetic dipole moment from Standard Model weak interactions and from contributions involving hadrons are important at {{the current level of}} precision, whereas these effects are not important for the electron. [...] The muon's anomalous magnetic dipole moment is also sensitive to contributions from new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. [...] For this reason, the muon's anomalous magnetic moment is normally used as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model rather than as a test of QED. A new experiment at Fermilab using the E821 magnet will improve the precision of this measurement.|$|E

Relative mental mass and relative mental complexity have chiefly to be observed. Assuming that the great inequality {{in the cost of}} reproduction to the two sexes, is the cause of unlikeness in mental mass, as in physical mass, this difference may be studied in connexion with reproductive differences presented by the various races, in respect of the ages at which reproduction commences, and the periods over which it lasts. An allied inquiry may be joined with this; namely, how far the mental developments of the two sexes are affected by their relative habits in respect to food and physical exertion? In many of the lower races, the women, treated with great brutality, are, physically, much inferior to the men: excess of labour and defect of nutrition being apparently the combined causes. Is any arrest of mental development simultaneously caused? ...|$|E

We sought to determine if systematic <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> LV <b>mass</b> occur between the two methods by comparing LV mass measured from simultaneous M-mode strip chart recordings and digitized recordings.

30|$|All absorbed doses {{presented}} in this paper are higher for the female phantom except {{in the case of the}} liver for 99 mTc-pertechnetate and thymus for 131 I. The reason for this could be that, except for the sex-specific modelling of the alimentary tract, the pharmacokinetics of the radiopharmaceutical is not gender-specific. If the highest absorbed dose contribution arises from non-penetrating radiation, the higher absorbed doses to the Reference Female reflect the smaller masses of the female phantom than the male phantom. To consider the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>mass,</b> sex-specific biokinetic models need to be created.|$|R

50|$|The {{atomic mass}} (mr) of an isotope is {{determined}} mainly by its mass number (i.e. number of nucleons in its nucleus).
