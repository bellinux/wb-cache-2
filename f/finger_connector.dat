50|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the ADC port by an additional <b>finger</b> <b>connector</b> {{on the video}} card, which plugs into a slot on the motherboard between the AGP slot and the back panel of the computer; on G4 Macs, some power is also sent through AGP pins 3 and 11. When ADC was introduced, AGP pins 3 and 11 were unassigned. In AGP 8x, pins 3 and 11 were assigned, so because of that, G4s are not directly compatible with AGP 8x. G5 Macs draw all power from the <b>finger</b> <b>connector</b> and therefore are 8x compatible. To use an AGP 8x card in a G4, pins 3 and 11 must be somehow disabled; {{this can be done}} by placing tape over the conductive part of the pin, slicing the PCB traces, or on some cards, desoldering surface mount resistors.|$|E

5000|$|IEEE-796: Microcomputer System Bus; First {{released}} by Intel in 1974. The cards {{did not use}} front panels, and they used card edge <b>fingers</b> as the <b>connectors</b> (similar to ISA/PC-AT cards). Companies like Northwest Technical still provide [...] "End of Life" [...] products for Multibus I. This bus is obsolete.|$|R
