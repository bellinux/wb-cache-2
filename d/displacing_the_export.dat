40|$|The DEAD-box RNA-helicase Dbp 5 /Rat 8 {{is known}} for its {{function}} in nuclear mRNA <b>export,</b> where it <b>displaces</b> <b>the</b> <b>export</b> receptor Mex 67 from the mRNA at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Here we show that Dbp 5 is also required for <b>the</b> nuclear <b>export</b> of both pre-ribosomal subunits. Yeast temperature-sensitive dbp 5 mutants accumulate both ribosomal particles in their nuclei. Furthermore, Dbp 5 genetically and physically interacts with known ribosomal transport factors such as Nmd 3. Similar to mRNA export we show that also for ribosomal transport Dbp 5 is required at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. However, unlike its role in mRNA export, Dbp 5 does not seem to undergo its ATPase cycle for this function, as ATPase-deficient dbp 5 mutants that selectively inhibit mRNA export do not affect ribosomal transport. Furthermore, mutants of GLE 1, the ATPase stimulating factor of Dbp 5, show no major ribosomal export defects. Consequently, while Dbp 5 uses its ATPase cycle to <b>displace</b> <b>the</b> <b>export</b> receptor Mex 67 from the translocated mRNAs, Mex 67 remains bound to ribosomal subunits upon transit to the cytoplasm, where it is detectable on translating ribosomes. Therefore, we propose a model, in which Dbp 5 supports ribosomal transport by capturing ribosomal subunits upon their cytoplasmic appearance at the NPC, possibly by binding export factors such as Mex 67. Thus, our findings reveal that although different ribonucleoparticles, mRNAs and pre-ribosomal subunits, use shared export factors, they utilize different transport mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which China displaced its competitors in high-tech exports using disaggregated data for the period 1992 – 2013. To address the endogeneity problem, we used a comprehensive set of instruments for Chinese high-tech exports in relevant markets, including China 2 ̆ 7 s GDP and distances to those markets. Results of our IV regressions revealed that in most of the high-tech sectors, Chinese <b>exports</b> had <b>displaced</b> <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> of its developing competitors such as India, South American exporters like Brazil and Mexico, and South-East Asian countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, especially in the period prior to the 2007 – 08 global financial crisis. Yet, Chinese exports had been associated with more high-tech exports of developed exporters like OECD countries, South Korea and Japan. Our findings suggest that while China became the world 2 ̆ 7 s top high-tech exporter, its high-tech exported products had been substitutes to those of other developing and emerging economies but complementary to that of developed economies...|$|R

40|$|China's export {{expansion}} is {{commonly associated with}} lower global manufacturing prices. For most countries, lower prices heighten global competition but also allow importing a cheaper and wider set of inputs and consumer goods. This paper investigates the balance of these two forces in Kenya, Mauritius and the Southern Africa Customs Union, the largest exporters of manufactured goods in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper uses the economic geography model of Redding and Venables (in Economic geography and international inequality, Journal of International Economics, 62, 53 - 22, 2004) to decompose the import growth {{of a large number}} of countries into supply and demand capacities. This decomposition allows for analysis of the extent to which China's export growth has altered manufacturing import and <b>export</b> prices for <b>the</b> selected countries. The study finds that China has significantly decreased world prices in major markets for manufactures, especially textiles, wearing apparel and footwear, potentially <b>displacing</b> <b>the</b> clothing <b>exports</b> of <b>the</b> selected African countries. As a consequence of China's export growth, these focus countries have also seen substantial reductions in their import prices across all manufacturing sectors. However, an estimation of their terms-of-trade suggests that <b>the</b> reductions in <b>export</b> prices outweigh <b>the</b> decrease in import prices and the countries are deemed to lose from China's manufactures export expansion.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} two major {{question}}s. First, {{the question of}} whether China and India are <b>displacing</b> <b>the</b> African manufacturing <b>export</b> from <b>the</b> third market. Second, whether there is an evidence of shifting comparative advantage from China and India to Africa. We employed a gravity model with a panel data using thirteen African exporter clothing and apparels for the period 1995 - 2005 to answer the first question. To answer the second question, we used a flying-gees model and estimated Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients on indices of the revealed comparative advantage vectors of the African exporters and China and India for the same period. Both the gravity and flying-geese models predicted similar outcome. We found that there is strong evidence that China has been displacing African manufactures from the third market while India has been complementing it {{in the early years of}} the study. However, the overall third market impact of China and India has been that of complementarity in the later years of the study period. This result is found to vary across countries. Furthermore, we found an evidence of shifting comparative advantage from China and India to Africa as the flying-geese theory predicts, South Africa being the leading goose followed by Kenya. The major implication of the study is that, in the world where China and India are reshaping the global economic order dynamically, the outcomes of the traditionally received wisdom of trade liberalization and industrialization policies through export promotion may be uncertain and requires strategic thinking...|$|R

40|$|AbstractImportin-α mediates nuclear protein import by binding nuclear {{localization}} {{signals and}} importin-β. We find approximately 30 % of SRP 1 p, the yeast importin-α, {{in a nuclear}} complex with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear cap-binding protein complex (CBC). Similarly, a large fraction of Xenopus CBC is associated with importin-α in the nucleus. CBC promotes nuclear export of capped U snRNAs and shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm. The CBC–importin-α complex binds specifically to capped RNA, suggesting that CBC might shuttle while bound to importin-α. Strikingly, importin-β binding <b>displaces</b> <b>the</b> RNA from the CBC–importin-α complex. Thus, the commitment of CBC for nuclear reentry triggers the release of <b>the</b> <b>export</b> substrate into <b>the</b> cytoplasm.
