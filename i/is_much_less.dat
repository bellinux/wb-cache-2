5|$|Mephedrone is a monoamine {{releasing}} agent. It is a chiral {{compound and}} both of its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> potent than S-mephedrone as a substrate at serotonin transporters.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> expensive to build because a single {{transmitter and receiver}} {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> massive {{than the}} Sun: {{estimates}} suggest {{it has only}} 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Despite the canonic {{status of}} Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often {{characterized}} as an under-recognized {{or even as}} a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) {{over the last few}} decades, he <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, or Franz Kafka.|$|E
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|Llantwit Major has {{considerable}} renown in South Wales as a surfing location, {{although it}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> known than Porthcawl {{further down the}} coast. The beach has a lifeguard station funded by the Vale of Glamorgan Council, built in the late 1990s, functioning during the summer months.. There is a beach cafe and often organised walks.|$|E

5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. More salt is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than the relict salt from Bonneville.|$|E
5|$|On {{most days}} of the week an average of 4,000 to 5,000 {{tourists}} visit the main valley. On the days that the Nile Cruises arrive, the number can rise to over 9,000. These levels are expected to rise to 25,000 by 2015. The West Valley <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> abundant than rubidium.|$|E

5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards {{the rim of the}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are {{studio and}} two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, {{a number that}} has {{remained}} constant since the 1980s, but it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the {{major part of the}} city's population is a rent-paying one.|$|E
5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E

5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes {{tend to be}} rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
25|$|In males, Gardasil {{may reduce}} {{their risk of}} genital warts and precancerous lesions caused by HPV. This {{reduction}} in precancerous lesions might be predicted to reduce the rates of penile and anal cancer in men. Since penile and anal cancers <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> common than cervical cancer, HPV vaccination of young men is likely to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> cost-effective than for young women.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, {{proposes that}} Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or {{otherwise}} contains a substantial interior space. No scientific evidence exists {{to support the}} idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate {{that it has a}} thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> dense than Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> vocal {{than the}} Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations {{have ever been}} recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
