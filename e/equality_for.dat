5|$|During Congressional Reconstruction, U.S. General John Schofield {{administered}} Virginia as Military District One. After 1866, {{according to}} the Radical Reconstruction Acts, a rebelling state which had vacated its delegation in the U.S. Congress was required to incorporate the 14th Amendment into its state constitution before it was allowed to participate again. By the time Schofield called a new state constitutional convention for 1868, three distinct parties had coalesced in Virginia. Radical Republicans, including most ex-slave freedmen, organized to advocate full political and social <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> blacks, but they wanted to exclude ex-Confederates from political participation either in government or at the ballot box. Moderate Unionists including many pre-war Whigs, sought political <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> blacks, but believed that ex-Confederates had {{to be included in}} the political community because of their majority in the white population. Conservatives wanted to ensure white control of the state without Radical influence on issues such as public education.|$|E

5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Margaret Mackworth, now {{the second}} Viscountess Rhondda, {{launched}} the Six Point Group, an action group that focused {{heavily on the}} equality {{between men and women}} and the rights of the child.

She established a number of women's organisations, pressure groups and launched the influential feminist journal Time and Tide. She also made an unsuccessful bid to gain entry into the House of Lords, fighting against a 1922 ruling that barred the admission of women.|$|E
5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E
5|$|The long {{nineteenth century}} saw {{profound}} {{cultural and economic}} changes in Belgium. The Industrial Revolution, which began to take effect in Belgium {{during the period of}} French rule, transformed the region's economy {{over the course of the}} period. By 1914, Belgium was acknowledged as one of the most densely industrialized countries in Europe, with notable coal mining and manufacturing industries. The period saw the gradual decline of the various dialects spoken in the country and the establishment of two distinct language groups, French in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders. French, traditionally spoken by the elite, was given legal predominance across the country. During the nineteenth century, both linguistic groups witnessed a cultural resurgence and developed separate traditions in literature and culture. By the end of the period, the Flemish Movement, seeking legal <b>equality</b> <b>for</b> Dutch language and even regional independence, had emerged in Flanders and a similar movement developed in Wallonia.|$|E

Here we characterize the <b>equality</b> cases <b>for</b> doubly stochastic matrices of general zero pattern. We further generalize the results to sums of matrices that are diagonally equivalent to doubly stochastic matrices. Our claims follow from inequalities we prove on norms of matrices. Finally, we prove the corresponding inequalities (and <b>equalities)</b> <b>for</b> nonnegative matrices that are not sums of matrices diagonally equivalent to doubly stochastic matrices...|$|R
