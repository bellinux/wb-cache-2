5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status {{not just}} to {{complete}} pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E

5|$|To ensure accuracy, Tayler {{arranged}} sittings {{with each}} member of the Kent team and made an effort to paint each one true to life. He initially planned to include non-striking Lancashire batsman Harry Makepeace, but when Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting, Tayler used another Lancashire player, William Findlay, as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> match, but he was available to visit Tayler's London studio as he had been newly appointed secretary of the Surrey County Cricket Club after his retirement from active cricket competition at the end of 1906.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} particularly important to hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final running order {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
5|$|The games always {{feature a}} number of {{religious}} overtones; after the first Dragon Warrior game saving, and reviving characters who have died, is performed by clergy in churches. Bishops wander around the over-world of Dragon Quest Monsters and can heal wounded characters. The final enemy {{in some of the}} Dragon Quest games is called the Demon Lord; for instance in Dragon QuestVII, the Demon Lord (known as Orgodemir <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> game) is the final boss, and there is a sidequest to battle against God. The first four Dragon Quest titles were subjected to censorship in their North American localizations, largely in keeping with Nintendo of America's content guidelines at the time that placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content. When these games were remade for the Game Boy Color, most censorship was removed. The translated versions of the games have largely followed the originals since Dragon QuestVII.|$|E
5|$|Logona Esau {{qualified}} for weightlifting via {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class. Born in the South Pacific island nation of Nauru in 1987, Esau was 21 {{years old at the}} time of his participation in his Beijing event. He was the most experienced and decorated of the three Tuvaluan athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102kilograms, 107kilograms, and 110kilograms successively. During the clean and jerks, Esau successfully lifted 138kilograms, then 144kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254kilograms. This ranked the Tuvaluan in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after lifting a combined 348kilograms.|$|E
