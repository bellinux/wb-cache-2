25|$|Different {{from the}} {{analysis}} on differentially expressed individual genes, another type of analysis focuses on differential expression or perturbation of pre-defined gene sets and is called gene set analysis. Gene set analysis demonstrated several major advantages over individual gene differential expression analysis. Gene sets are groups of genes that are functionally related according to current knowledge. Therefore, gene set analysis is considered a <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> analysis approach. Commonly used gene sets include those derived from KEGG pathways, Gene Ontology terms, gene groups that share some other functional annotations, such as common transcriptional regulators etc. Representative gene set analysis methods include GSEA, which estimates significance of gene sets based on permutation of sample labels, and GAGE, which tests the significance of gene sets based on permutation of gene labels or a parametric distribution.|$|E

25|$|A {{comprehensive}} programme {{of organizational}} reform and culture change began in 2008 {{after the release}} of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.|$|E
25|$|Science is {{a system}} of <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> on observation, {{empirical}} evidence, {{and the development of}} theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts. Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists. However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its geological history and the origins, distributions and relationships of living organisms found on it. Early science incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually falsified and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.|$|E
25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.|$|E
