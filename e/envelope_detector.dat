2500|$|The crystal {{detector}} demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal {{which represents the}} sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, the detector was a cat's whisker detector [...] consisting of a fine metal wire, the [...] "cat's whisker", on an adjustable arm that touched a pea-sized lump of semiconducting mineral. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. [...] The cat's whisker detector was a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. [...] The crystal functions as an <b>envelope</b> <b>detector,</b> rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, {{so it can be}} converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple <b>envelope</b> <b>detector</b> like standard AM.|$|E

5000|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} of {{a carrier}} signal normally results in two mirror-image sidebands. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). For example, if a 900 kHz carrier is amplitude modulated by a 1 kHz audio signal, {{there will be}} components at 899 kHz and 901 kHz as well as 900 kHz in the generated Radio Frequency spectrum; so an audio bandwidth of (say) 7 kHz will require a radio spectrum bandwidth of 14 kHz. In conventional AM transmission, as used by [...] "Broadcast Band" [...] AM stations, the original audio signal can be recovered ("detected") by either synchronous detector circuits or by simple <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors</b> because the carrier and both sidebands are present. This is sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation (DSB-AM), but not all variants of DSB are compatible with <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most {{practical}} <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors</b> {{use either}} half-wave or full-wave rectification {{of the signal}} to convert the AC audio input into a pulsed DC signal. Filtering is then used to smooth the final result. This filtering is rarely perfect and some [...] "ripple" [...] {{is likely to remain}} on the envelope follower output, particularly for low frequency inputs such as notes from a bass guitar. More filtering gives a smoother result, but decreases the responsiveness; thus, real-world designs must be optimized for the application.|$|R
2500|$|However it is {{possible}} to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a linear amplifier. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an <b>envelope</b> <b>detector</b> is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally not referred to as [...] "AM" [...] even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term [...] "modulation index" [...] loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an <b>envelope</b> <b>detector</b> such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband â those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM â and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
5000|$|For big [...] it {{can serve}} an <b>envelope</b> <b>detector</b> on a {{rectified}} signal.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. This {{can be accomplished by}} transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors</b> is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe paper {{develops}} {{some new}} {{results for the}} degradation in SNR, due to unwanted phase jitter, for a FSK receiver system. The unwanted phase modulation {{is assumed to be}} present equally on either FSK tone and is modeled as a sample function of a Gaussian random process. Results are derived based on a standard type FSK system employing bandpass filters, square law <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors,</b> a subtractor, and a post detection lowpass data filter. The degradation was found to depend on the mark-space filter bandwidths, the doppler frequency of the received tones, the nominal SNR and the post detection filter bandwidths. The degradation is minimal for small doppler shifts; however, once the tones, in the predetection filters were displaced to within the post detection filter bandwidth of the predetection filter band edge, the degradation increased dramatically. This was {{due to the fact that}} the filtering of the phase noise caused the <b>envelope</b> <b>detectors</b> to produce self noise. In fact, at high SNR's the degradation is primarily due to self noise or envelope distortion due to filtering of the phase jitter spectrum. It is important to point out that the degradation found here is due only to phase noise effects and not sin Ï/Ï losses. The results derived here are accurate for phase jitter variances â² 0. 1.
