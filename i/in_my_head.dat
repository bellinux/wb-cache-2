5|$|On May 19, 2004, Rollins began {{hosting a}} weekly radio show, Harmony <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head,</b> on Indie 103.1 radio in Los Angeles. The show aired every Monday evening, with Rollins playing music ranging from early rock and jump blues to hard rock, blues rock, folk rock, punk rock, heavy metal and rockabilly, and {{touching}} on hip hop, jazz, world music, reggae, classical music and more. Harmony <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>Head</b> often emphasizes B-sides, live bootlegs and other rarities, and nearly every episode has featured a song {{either by the}} Beastie Boys or British group The Fall.|$|E
5|$|I had it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Farrell and British-American writer Emma Forrest dated {{for over}} a year, an {{experience}} she discusses in depth in her memoir Your Voice <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (focusing on {{her relationship with her}} therapist, who died unexpectedly); it is a planned film starring either Emily Blunt or Emma Watson, and Stanley Tucci, and directed by Francesca Gregorini. According to Forrest, she and Farrell planned to have a child together before he ended the relationship.|$|E

5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|Since Black Flag disbanded, Rollins {{has hosted}} {{numerous}} radio shows, such as Harmony <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> on Indie 103, {{and television shows}} such as The Henry Rollins Show, MTV's 120 Minutes, and Jackass. He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of Sons of Anarchy, in the final seasons of the animated series The Legend of Korra as Zaheer, and has also had roles in several films. Rollins has campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including promoting LGBT rights, World Hunger Relief, the West Memphis Three {{and an end to}} war in particular.|$|E
25|$|In between other {{commitments}} (his radio show Harmony <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head,</b> his cable/satellite TV show The Henry Rollins Show, and his spoken word tours), Rollins also reunited the Haskett-Gibbs-Cain lineup.|$|E

25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

25|$|After Unicorn Records {{declared}} bankruptcy, Black Flag {{were released}} from the injunction, and returned with a vengeance, starting {{with the release of}} My War. The album was both a continuation of Damaged, and a vast leap forward. While the general mood and lyrics continue in the confrontational and emotional tone of Damaged, the album would prove influential to grunge music as the decade progressed. Lacking a bass player, Ginn played bass guitar, using the pseudonym Dale Nixon. On the May 1, 2007 episode of his radio program Harmony <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head,</b> Rollins reported that one of Ginn's favorite albums during this era was Mahavishnu Orchestra's Birds of Fire (1973), and opined that John McLaughlin's guitar work influenced Ginn.|$|E
25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> are distinct from the concepts in your head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E

Spins editor, Brian Josephs, complimented the song's reggae production and the group's sensual performance; however, he had a negative view of Fetty Wap's appearance commenting that the rapper [...] "fails to come off here as much more than Default Guest Rapper". However, Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic felt that [...] "All <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (Flex) brings in the most exuberant rapper of our times, Fetty Wap, to very catchy effect." ...|$|E
500|$|... "All <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (Flex)" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American group Fifth Harmony, featuring vocals by rapper Fetty Wap, for their second studio album, 7/27 (2016), which was released on May 27, 2016.

Musically, [...] "All <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (Flex)" [...] is a reggae-influenced, pop song backed by synths, percussion, and guitar, containing an interpolation of the 1995 song [...] "Flex" [...] by Mad Cobra. The song was released as second single after a special encore performance on Xfinity following the 2016 Billboard Music Awards on May 22, 2016. The single was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the United States on May 31, 2016.|$|E
500|$|.....when I {{was writing}} it, I {{was in a}} cabin covered with snow {{and it was very}} quiet outside. This was all <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> of course.

500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the songâ€”not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the sceneâ€”were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> In John's head it might have been. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
