25|$|The euphonium, {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass {{instrument}} like the euphonium, {{this means that}} when no valves are in use the <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert pitch in the bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.|$|E

[...] Different methods {{can be used to}} determine the identity of the same substance, and {{it is up to the}} examiner to determine which method will produce the best results. [...] Factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are the length of time a specific <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> take to examine a substance and the destructive nature of that instrument. They prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve the evidence for further examination. [...] Nondestructive techniques can also be used to narrow down the possibilities, making it more likely that the correct method will be used the first time when a destructive method is used.|$|E

2500|$|Lightly {{touching}} the string with a fingertip at a harmonic node, but without fully pressing the string, and then plucking or bowing the string, creates harmonics. Instead {{of the normal}} tone, a higher pitched note sounds. [...] Each node is at an integer division of the string, for example half-way or one-third {{along the length of}} the string. A responsive <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> sound numerous possible harmonic nodes {{along the length of the}} string. Harmonics are marked in music either with a little circle above the note that determines the pitch of the harmonic, or by diamond-shaped note heads. There are two types of harmonics: natural harmonics and artificial harmonics (also known as false harmonics).|$|E
2500|$|With {{cartilage}} piercing, {{the blunt}} force of an ear piercing <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> traumatize the cartilage, and therefore make healing more difficult. [...] Also, {{because there is}} substantially less blood flow in ear cartilage than in the earlobe, infection {{is a much more}} serious issue. [...] There have been several documented cases of severe infections of the upper ear following piercing with an ear piercing instrument, which required courses of antibiotics to clear up. There are many ways that an infection can occur: the most common way is when the person that got pierced decides to take out the piercing too early. According to the A.M.A, [...] the proper waiting period to change or take out a piercing with substantially less risk of infection would be three weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1711, Duncombe {{commissioned}} an organ for the church, the first to have a swell-box, by Abraham Jordan (father and son). [...] The Spectator announced that [...] "Whereas Mr Abraham Jordan, senior and junior, have, with their own hands, joinery excepted, made and erected a very large organ in St Magnus' Church, at the foot of London Bridge, consisting of four sets of keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting sounds by swelling notes, which never was in any organ before; this <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> be publicly opened on Sunday next , the performance by Mr John Robinson.

2500|$|A mercury {{barometer}} has a glass tube closed {{at one end}} with an open mercury-filled reservoir at the base. [...] The weight of the mercury creates a vacuum {{in the top of}} the tube known as Torricellian vacuum. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. [...] High atmospheric pressure places more force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. [...] Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the force placed on the reservoir. Since higher temperature levels around the <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> reduce the density of the mercury, the scale for reading the height of the mercury is adjusted to compensate for this effect. [...] The tube has to be at least as long as the amount dipping in the mercury + head space + the maximum length of the column.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{band member}} {{can choose the}} {{difficulty}} at which they play (spanning Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert; a [...] "Super Easy" [...] difficulty is also present in Lego Rock Band for younger players). Furthermore, with Rock Band 3, players can select the Pro mode of their instrument {{if they have the}} appropriate controller for it; Pro mode challenges guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards to play their controllers closer to the real-life instrument, note-for-note. [...] If a player does not play well enough and falls {{to the bottom of the}} Band Meter, they will fail out of the song and their <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> be muted from the audio mix. However, any active player can activate their Overdrive to bring failed players back into the song, [...] "saving" [...] the band member. However, a band member can only be saved twice; after the third failure, they cannot be brought back for that song. Failed players continuously drag the band's Band Meter down until they are saved. If the player is not saved before the Band Meter reaches the bottom, the band fails the song. Special portions of songs are labeled as [...] "Unison Phrases," [...] which reward the band with a score and Overdrive bonus if each player can play their parts perfectly during the phrase. Select songs end with a special [...] "Big Rock Ending," [...] which gives the players a chance to improvise and earn extra points. If each player successfully plays the final notes of the song following the freestyle portion of the [...] "Big Rock Ending," [...] the band earns all of the [...] "Big Rock Ending" [...] points. Otherwise, the bonus is lost.|$|E

If {{the wires}} of a {{galvanometer}} be terminated by plates, and these be immersed in dilute acid, {{contained in a}} regularly formed rectangular glass trough, connected at each end with a voltaic battery by poles equal to {{the section of the}} fluid, a part of the electricity will pass through the instrument and cause a certain deflection. And if the plates are always retained at the same distance from each other and from the sides of the trough, are always parallel to each other, and uniformly placed relative to the fluid, then, whether they are immersed near the middle of the decomposing solution, or at one end, still the <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> indicate the same deflection, and consequently the same electric influence.|$|E

It has been recreated painfully and laboriously after twenty years by courage and fidelity. It has come into being--it is here. It is now at work, and by legislation and by the influence which it can exercise throughout the whole world, it is making even our opponents talk our language, making all parties in the State think of social reform, and concern themselves with social and domestic affairs. Beware how you injure that great instrument, as Mr. Gladstone called it--or weaken it at a moment when the masses of this country have need of it. Why, what would happen, if this present Government were to perish? On its tomb would be written: [...] "Beware of social reform. The labouring classes will not support a Government engaged in social reform. Every social reform will cost you votes. Beware of social reform. 'Learn to think Imperially.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Hence {{it follows}} that the utmost power of art can only be given in a {{material}} capable of receiving and retaining the influence of the subtlest touch of the human hand. That hand is the most perfect agent of material power existing in the universe; and its full subtlety can only be shown when the material it works on, or with, is entirely yielding. The chords of a perfect <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> receive it, but not of an imperfect one; the softly bending point of the hair pencil, and soft melting of colour, will receive it, but not even the chalk or pen point, still less the steel point, chisel, or marble. The hand of a sculptor may, indeed, be as subtle as that of a painter, but all its subtlety is not bestowable nor expressible: the touch of Titian, Correggio, or Turner, [Footnote: See Appendix IV., [...] "Subtlety of Hand."] is a far more marvellous piece of nervous action than can be shown in anything but colour, or in the very highest conditions of executive expression in music. In proportion as the material worked upon is less delicate, the execution necessarily becomes lower, and the art with it. This is one main principle of all work. Another is, that whatever the material you choose to work with, your art is base if it does not bring out the distinctive qualities of that material.|$|E
6000|$|Putting that {{solution}} aside, {{let us now}} {{see what}} effect this <b>instrument</b> <b>will</b> have upon water. Here are two little platinum-plates which I intend to make {{the ends of the}} battery, and this (C) is a little vessel so shaped as to enable me to take it to pieces, and shew you its construction. In these two cups (A and B) I pour mercury, which touches the ends of the wires connected with the platinum-plates. In the vessel (C) I pour some water containing a little acid (but which is put only for the purpose of facilitating the action; it undergoes no change in the process), and connected with the top of the vessel is a bent glass tube (D), which may remind you of the pipe which was connected with the gun barrel in our furnace experiment, and which now passes under the jar (F). I have now adjusted this apparatus, and we will proceed to affect the water in some way or other. In the other case, I sent the water through a tube which was made red-hot; I am now going to pass the electricity through the contents of this vessel. Perhaps I may boil the water; if I do boil the water, I shall get steam; and you know that steam condenses when it gets cold, and you will therefore see by that whether I do boil the water or not. Perhaps, however, I shall not boil the water, but produce some other effect. You shall have the experiment and see. There is one wire which I will put to this side (A), and here is the other wire which I will put to the other side (B), and you will soon see whether any disturbance takes place. Here it is seeming to boil up famously; but does it boil? Let us see whether that which goes out is steam or not. I think you will soon see the jar (F) will be filled with vapour, if that which rises from the water is steam. But can it be steam? Why, certainly not; because there it remains, you see, unchanged. There it is standing over the water, and it cannot therefore be steam, but must be a permanent gas of some sort What is it? Is it hydrogen? Is it anything else? Well, we will examine it. If it is hydrogen, it will burn. [The Lecturer then ignited a portion of the gas collected, which burnt with an explosion.] ...|$|E

And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about {{the middle of the day}} she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us." ...|$|E
