5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> frustration, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> differing views {{of the future of}} computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was low, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel {{across the country}} and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{has many}} bars and {{restaurants}} that provide diverse styles of cuisine, which is <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> it being a college town with three colleges.

5|$|Magnus co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, {{but less than}} three years into his reign, Magnus became ill and died.

5|$|Robert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen all {{produced}} {{oxygen in}} {{experiments in the}} 17th and the 18th century {{but none of them}} recognized it as a chemical element.
