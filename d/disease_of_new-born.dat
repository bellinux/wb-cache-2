Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) is a new <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>new-born</b> calves characterised by extreme haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and cel-lular depletion of the bone marrow [2]. BNP ends lethally in the vast majority of cases, and no specific treatment is available. Recent studies convincingly revealed that BNP is an alloimmune/alloantibody mediated disease induced rected against a single stranded (ss) RNA virus is distin-guished by an extremely high production of specific BVDV antibodies, which is potentially due to the unique adjuvant included in the vaccination dose. Alloantibodies induced after vaccination with the PregSure ® BVDV vaccine bind to MHC class I cell surface proteins of leukocytes and also o...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma and serum by Dennis Lo {{and colleagues at}} Ox-ford University, UK, opened an exciting route for the noninvasive determination of fetal genetic traits (1). It has proved very effective for identifying fetal genetic loci completely absent from thematernal genome, such as those on the Y chromosome or the RHD 3 (Rh blood group, D antigen) gene (2). Consequently, this ap-proach is already being used in clinical settings for the determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for X chromosome–linked disorders or fetal Rh D status in pregnancies at risk for hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new-born.</b> Todate, several thousand analyses have beenper-formed in several European centers.

40|$|Hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> {{the newborn}} due to ABO {{incompatibility}} was first ob-served by Halbrecht in 1944. This entity has a spectrum ranging from minimal hemolysis requiring no therapy, {{as is the}} case in most instances, to severe hemo-lytic disease requiring aggressive managment including exchange transfusion in a small percentage of cases. An extreme degree <b>of</b> hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new-born</b> due to ABO incompatibility, i. e., hydrops fetalis, has not been well docu-mented in the English literature. We present a case of hydrops fetalis due to ABO incompatibility. The severity <b>of</b> hemolytic <b>disease</b> due to ABO incompatibility can be forecast when indicated in selected cases. THE FIRST CASES <b>of</b> hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the newborn (HDN) due to ABO incompatibility were described by Halbrecht and by Grumbach and Gasser. 2 IgG anti-A and anti-B are found more fre-quently in sera from group 0 individuals than in sera from group A or B individuals, 3, 4 and anti-A, B i...|$|R
40|$|The K {{blood group}} remains an {{important}} target in hemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new-born</b> (HDN), with no immune prophylaxis available. The {{aim was to}} characterize the Th response to K as a key step in design-ing specific immunotherapy and under-standing the immunogenicity of the Ag. PBMCs from K-negative women who had anti-K Abs after incompatible pregnancy, and PBMCs from unimmunized controls, were screened for proliferative responses to peptide panels spanning the K or k single amino acid polymorphism. A dominant K peptide with the polymor-phism at the C terminus elicited prolifera-tion in 90 % of alloimmunized women, and {{it was confirmed that}} responding cells expressed helper CD 3 CD 4 and “memory ” CD 45 RO phenotypes, and were MHC class II restricted. A relatively high prevalence of background peptide responses independent of alloimmuniza-tion may contribute to K immunogenicity. First, cross-reactive environmental Ag(s) pre-prime Kell-reactive Th cells, and, second, the K substitution disrupts an N-glycosylation motif, allowing the ex-posed amino acid chain to stimulate a Th repertoire that is unconstrained by self-tolerance in K-negative individuals. The dominant K peptide was effective in inducing linked suppression in HLA-transgenic mice and can now be taken forward for immunotherapy to prevent HDN because of anti-K responses.

40|$|Seven IgG 1 {{and seven}} IgG 3 human {{monoclonal}} antibodies derived from heterohybridoma or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes and specific for the D antigen {{of the human}} Rh blood group system were tested {{for their ability to}} bring about red cell attachment to and phagocytosis by monocytes. The antibodies produced by the heterohybridomas were also investigated for their potency to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by monocytes. When red cells were sensitized with any of the IgG 1 anti-D antibodies, most of them were ingested by the phagocytes. By contrast, many of the red cells coated with any of the IgG 3 antibodies remained attached to the monocyte surface while only few underwent phagocytosis. Some of the attached red cells remained on the phagocyte exterior for a considerable length of time. The ADCC activities of the IgG 3 anti-D antibodies was greater than that of the IgG 1 anti-D antibodies. The results mean that in vitro IgG 1 anti-D mediates red cell destruction mainly by phagocytosis, while IgG 3 anti-D causes their destruction predominantly by prolonged cytolysis. These differences between the effector functions of human monoclonal IgG 1 and IgG 3 anti-D antibodies might have important implications for their use in the prophylaxis <b>of</b> haemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new-born...</b>|$|R

40|$|The incorporation, for {{the first}} time, of whole intact human erythrocytes, {{containing}} viable antigens, into an electroactive polypyrrole matrix, from which signals, direct and indirect, were induced provides encouragement {{for the development of}} an immunobiosensor for the detection of binding of blood group antibodies to their respective antigens. The detection of binding of blood group antibodies to their respective antigens {{is an integral part of}} determining a blood group and in antibody detection. The interest in blood grouping and antibody detection corresponds to the need by the medical profession to administer or transfuse human blood and blood products to other humans in order to improve the quality of life and longevity. Antibodies to ABO and Rhesus (Rh) antigens are also important indicators in screening for haemolytic <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new-born</b> (HON) and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA). A prototype of an immuno-biosensor surface for detecting antibodies recognising the 2 ̆ 7 A 2 ̆ 7 and Rh(O) antigens was constructed. The biosensor surface was synthesised to incorporate intact erythrocytes into the polymer (plastic), comprising polypyrrole, polyelectrolyte and a significant proportion of the mass as erythrocytes. Polymers were synthesised with a constant electrical current (1. 5 mAcm- 2 for 10 secs), where the polyanion of polyvinyl sulphonate (PVS) and the human erythrocytes (approximately 1. 0 x 106 erythrocytes cm- 2) were incorporated during synthesis to balance the positive charge on the polymer backbone. The process was followed by using oximetry and light microscopy to demonstrate the integrity of the erythrocytes in the polymerisation solution and in the polymer matrix. The majority of erythrocytes were incorporated with even distribution as intact discs, as shown by light and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrochemical characterisation of the polymer using cyclic voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microgravimetry (EQCM) and resistometry showed that incorporating erythrocytes and some erythrocyte membrane (upto 70 - 72...|$|R

Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, known {{to be sensitive to}} behavioral stress and treatment of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX), is involved in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories. Here, we investigated whether neurogenesis also occurs in the amygdala and contributes to auditory fear memory. In rats showing persistent auditory fear memory following fear conditioning, we found that the survival <b>of</b> <b>new-born</b> cells and the number <b>of</b> <b>new-born</b> cells that differentiated into mature neurons labeled by BrdU and NeuN decreased in the amygdala, but the number of cells that developed into astrocytes labeled by BrdU and GFAP increased.
