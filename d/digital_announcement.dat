50|$|Due to {{the many}} differing types of {{stations}} that CityRail serves, their screens varied in form. In station where trains arrived at a higher frequency, 2 or more vertical LED screens were used on each platform to display the destination and arrival time whereas in low frequency areas 1 or 2 dual horizontal LED screens with a larger font were used. Manual destination indicator boards were still used at some lower patron stations. In regional areas, a station relied on <b>digital</b> voice <b>announcement</b> for information on services. CBSM (Custom Built Sheet Metal) {{was responsible for the}} manufacture of many indicator board encasings.|$|R

5000|$|Rail systems {{typically}} have an interface with a passenger information system (PIS) server, at each station linked to train describers which state {{the location of}} rolling stock on the network from sensors on trackside signaling equipment. The PIS invokes a stored message to be played from a local or remote <b>digital</b> voice <b>announcement</b> system, or a series of message fragments to be assembled in the correct order, for example: [...] " [...] / the / 23.30 / First_Great_Western / Night_Riviera_sleeper_service / from / London_Paddington / to / Penzance / .... / will depart from platform / one / this train is formed of / 12_carriages /." [...] Messages are routed via an IP network and are played on local amplification equipment. Taken together, the PA, routing, DVA, passenger displays and PIS interface {{are referred to as}} the customer information system (CIS), a term which itself is often used interchangeably with the term passenger information system.|$|R
