5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} 200m final {{with a time of}} 19.98seconds, some distance off the winner Usain Bolt who had broken the world record. However, it transpired that both the silver and bronze medalists (Churandy Martina of the Netherlands Antilles and American Wallace Spearmon) <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> out of their lanes thus they were disqualified. As a result, Dix received his second Olympic bronze medal. Further disqualifications occurred in the heats of the Olympic 4×100 meter relay race: Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay misjudged a baton pass, causing the American team to be eliminated and spoiling any chance of Dix receiving a relay medal. He finished the Olympics as the only American sprinter to medal in two individual events. Dix closed the season with two sub-10 second runs at the Weltklasse and Athletissima meetings, finishing second to a Jamaican on both occasions (Bolt and Asafa Powell).|$|E
5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite.

While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

5|$|The {{dormitory}} {{was known}} as North Hall upon its opening.

Jewett. Jewett served as Vassar's first president from his election to the office in February 1861 until his departure from the college in spring 1864 after a dispute with the school's founder and namesake, Matthew Vassar. Although Jewett was instrumental in providing {{a vision for the}} college, the school did not open until 1865 meaning he never had the chance to oversee its student body.|$|E
5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards deep in his own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{dominated}} the game, defeating Illinois 31–14. Michigan scored {{two touchdowns in}} the first half. Fitzgerald Toussaint ran for 121 yards in the first quarter, including a 65-yard run on the second {{play of the game}} to set up a nine-yard touchdown run by Denard Robinson. In the second quarter, Robinson scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on a two-yard run. Michigan lost another scoring opportunity in the second quarter after tight end Kevin Koger gained 40 yards on a pass from Robinson. Robinson ran for an apparent touchdown from the eight-yard line, but the call was reversed when replay officials ruled that Robinson <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> out of bounds at the two-yard line. On fourth down from the one-yard line, Robinson was stopped after a low snap slowed his momentum. A fumble by Robinson ended another drive, and Brendan Gibbons missed a 38-yard field goal with one minute left in the half. Michigan's defense held Illinois to 30 total yards in the first half. In the third quarter, Gibbons kicked a 27-yard field goal, but Illinois responded with a touchdown on a one-yard run by Nathan Scheelhaase. Denard Robinson left the game in the third quarter after sustaining a blow to his wrist. In the fourth quarter, J.T. Floyd intercepted a Scheelhaase pass and returned it 43 yards into Illinois territory. Shortly thereafter, backup quarterback Devin Gardner threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Martavious Odoms to put Michigan ahead 24–7. Illinois closed the gap to 24–14 on an 18-play drive capped by a one-yard touchdown run by Jason Ford. After the touchdown, the Illini attempted an onside kick, but Michigan recovered, and Toussaint ran 27 yards for Michigan's fourth and final touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of the}} Book of Common Prayer {{became law}} in 1549. King Edward's half-sister, Mary Tudor, de facto had licence to {{continue}} hearing mass in private. So {{soon as he was}} in power, Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend. Mary, who in her turn did not tolerate the Book of Common Prayer in any of her residences, was not prepared to make any concessions. She planned to flee the country but then could not make up her mind in the last minute. Mary denied Edward's personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles. After a meeting with King and Council, in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law, she sent the Imperial ambassador de Scheyfye to threaten war on England. The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> out of his commission, {{but at the same time}} would not risk all-important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands, so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary's household officers were arrested. On his next visit to the Council, de Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40—Dudley was alluding to Mary's refusal to accept Edward's demands on grounds of his young age. In the end a silent compromise came into effect: Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner, while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown.|$|E
5|$|As expected, Ezeh, who had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury, redshirted his freshman year. Prior to his redshirt freshman season, he changed jersey numbers from 44 to 45 as he converted from fullback to linebacker. On May 22, 2007, {{he was charged with}} suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated for an incident when his vehicle struck a utility pole on the same street on which he lives while his blood-alcohol content was 0.11% (the legal limit in Michigan is 0.08%). Ezeh pleaded not guilty, and the trial was scheduled for September 19 in the 15th District Court. The time of the accident was outside the permissible times for Ezeh's restricted driving license that resulted from a prior non-alcohol-related accident. On the football field, redshirt freshman Ezeh entered the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team in a three-way battle to replace NFL-bound David Harris at middle linebacker with redshirt junior John Thompson and junior college transfer Austin Panter, who had been named national junior college defensive player of the year. Harris also hailed from Grand Rapids and had worn the number 45. The week before the season opener, The Detroit News declared Ezeh the starter, however, the Ann Arbor News and Ezeh's hometown The Grand Rapids Press both stated that the race between Ezeh and Thompson was undecided heading into the game. In the aftermath of the September 1, opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, more was made of the fact that both players had trouble playing the position than who had started the game. Ezeh started the first game, but lost his spot to Thompson in the next two. After three weeks of play, Thompson, who had been voted the hardest hitter on the team the previous two seasons, had established himself as the starter by ranking second on the team in tackles. However, although Thompson <b>had</b> <b>stepped</b> up to the role he was notable for having trouble with pass coverage. Ezeh accumulated no statistics in the third and fourth game, but recorded his first interception in the fifth game on September 29 against Northwestern on a deflected pass. Ezeh started that game because of an injury. The following week, he again started in place of the injured Thompson and recorded nine tackles against Eastern Michigan. He also forced a fumble and fielded one kickoff return. Even though Thompson recovered from his ankle injury after four weeks, Ezeh retained the starting job the remainder of the season for a total of ten starts. Thompson only recorded four tackles the rest of the year. On November 1, his lawyer stated that on August 29 Ezeh had pleaded guilty to an operating while visibly intoxicated charge, which is a serious misdemeanor but a lesser charge than the original operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and had sought alcohol counseling prior to his sentence. The plea resulted in a year's probation, three days in a work release program, a substantial payment covering fines, court costs and restitution. He committed to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class. In the November 3 Paul Bunyan Trophy victory against Michigan State he recorded a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. One of the sacks occurred on Michigan State's final series of downs in Michigan territory to help secure the 2824 win. Ezeh recorded 12 tackles in the Michigan – Ohio State rivalry game against Ohio State on November 17 to end the regular season.|$|E
