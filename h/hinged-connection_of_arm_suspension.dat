The primary intent {{of this study was to}} determine if <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> is an effective analogue for simulating the effects of weightlessness on human skeletal muscle.

On the other hand, RBFNN used to investigate linear response <b>of</b> lower <b>arm.</b> It can be seen that the robust design was capable to optimize the lower vehicle arm by using stochastic optimization and artificial intelligent techniques. The developed linear model based on SDI and CCD is statistically adequate and can be used to navigate the design space. A new parameter of material can be reconsidered in order to optimize the design. The results can significantly reduce the cost and time to market, improve product reliability and customer confidence. These results can be use as guideline before developing the prototype...|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the development of}} robust design <b>of</b> lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> using stochastic optimization. The strength of the design analyze by finite element software. The structural model <b>of</b> the lower <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was mode by using the solidworks. The finite element model and analysis were performed utilizing the finite element analysis code. The linear elastic analysis was performed using NASTRAN codes. TET 10 and TET 4 mesh {{has been used in}} the stress analysis and the highest Von Mises stress of TET 10 has been selected for the robust design parameter. The development of Robust design was carried out using the Monte Carlo approach, which all the optimization parameter for the design has been optimized in Robust design software. The improvements from the Stochastic Design Improvement (SDI) are obtained. The design capability to endure more pressure with lower predicted stress is identified through the SDI process. A lower density and modulus of elasticity of material can be reconsidered in order to optimize the design. The area of the design that can be altered for the optimization and modification is identified through the stress analysis result. As a conclusion, the robust design by using stochastic optimization was capable to optimize the lower <b>arm</b> <b>suspension.</b> Thus, all the result from this project can be use as guideline before developing the prototype...|$|R
40|$|Structure {{optimization}} techniques {{under static}} load conditions {{have been widely}} used in automotive industry for lightweight and performance improvement of modern cars. However, these static load conditions could not represent all the severe situations of automobile parts which subjected to complex loads varying with time, especially for lower control <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> front <b>suspension.</b> In this study, dynamic optimization <b>of</b> lower control <b>arm</b> was performed by combing traditional static load optimization techniques and multi-body dynamics by Equivalent Static Load (ESL). And the best draw-bead distribution of the stamped lower control arm was attained. Comparing the MBD analysis results of the new design derived from dynamic optimization and original structure, results show that the strength and stiffness was increased significantly while the mass was almost unchanged...|$|R
50|$|A {{short long}} <b>arms</b> <b>suspension</b> (SLA) {{is also known}} as an unequal length double {{wishbone}} <b>suspension.</b> The upper <b>arm</b> is typically an A-arm, and is shorter than the lower link, which is an A-arm or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair <b>of</b> tension/compression <b>arms.</b> In the latter case the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual ball joint suspension.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Under {{the study}} {{discussed}} in the paper, a geometric model <b>of</b> a car’s <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was prepared and subsequently imported into the MSC. Adams environment dedicated to studying dynamics of multi-body systems and then broken down into finite elements. Modal frequencies were established for the said model. The superior {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the loads affecting an arm operating in a complete car’s suspension system for the road-induced input functions simulated in the Adams/Car module. Design/methodology/approach: Under the study in question, a geometric model <b>of</b> a car <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> was developed based on CAD software. The model was imported into the Adams/View environment and its body changed from rigid into a flexible one. Materials were defined and modal frequencies were established for the model prepared. Findings: The study outcome is an FEM-based <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> model and the modal frequencies established. The <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> model in question is to be applied in further numerical experiments related to studying dynamics of automotive vehicle suspension systems. Research limitations/implications: The numerical experiment results {{discussed in the}} paper require that the model should be adjusted to a real element. This, in turn, requires modal analysis <b>of</b> the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> and comparison <b>of</b> the vectors describing the forms of free vibrations. Originality/value: The model developed will be applied as a flexible element in a complex suspension system of a complete car and used to determine its dynamic loads...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} {{responsible for}} the chassis and suspension was Willy Black, who had designed and engineered the 600. The drivetrain and suspension {{were similar to those}} of the 600, with a rear-mounted flat-twin engine powering the rear wheels, leading <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> at the front, and semi trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> at the rear. The 700 used a steel monocoque structure, and was the first BMW automobile to do so.|$|R
5000|$|The German World War II Panther tank (and some Tigers) had double torsion bars. [...] Needing bars {{longer than}} {{the width of the}} tank to get the {{required}} spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm,</b> while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On {{the opposite side of the}} tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection <b>of</b> the <b>suspension</b> <b>arm</b> caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist. A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch.|$|R
30|$|During the war period, French {{developed}} a standardized system of rubber springs {{used in their}} tanks, which consist {{of a pair of}} wheels springing against each other [5]. Rubber has a natural dampening property and is not prone to breaking like steel. But the ability to stand fire and shell fragment is limited. Similar systems are used today in vocational trucks and bulldozers. The volute spring was a very durable system consisted <b>of</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and coiled strips of metal, which was {{developed a}}nd used only on US tanks [6]. As the metal layers glided over each other, it was a strong system and the leverage <b>of</b> bogie <b>arms</b> provided a decent travel distance. Later variants used the horizontal volute springs, springing one wheels off another to interconnect, which contributed to surprisingly long track life combined with the advanced and well-insulated American running gear design.|$|R
